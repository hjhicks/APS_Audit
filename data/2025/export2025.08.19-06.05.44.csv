This article presents a channel sounder that allows mmWave channel measurements that are double-directional, ultrawideband, real-time, and optionally multilink. The sounder is based on the principle of beam switching; it provides 51-dBm EIRP and can scan with an Field-of-View (FoV) of 360° on both the Transmitter (TX) and Receiver (RX) sides. It achieves an Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) snapshot acquisition time of 2.4 ms and can gaplessly stream/record the received signal for up to 8 s. During this time, up to 768 angular combinations per MIMO snapshot are recorded with a 2- $\mu $ s multitone waveform with 1 GHz of bandwidth. This bandwidth results in a delay resolution of 0.3 m with a maximum detectable excess delay of 600 m. The number of angular combinations can be increased in exchange for a longer MIMO snapshot time. The sounder also features a multinode configuration that allows simultaneous measurements with three spatially distributed TX locations. We also present the timing methodology and FPGA implementation developed to fully exploit the capabilities of the switched-beam arrays, as well as the sounder calibration methodology.

It is thus considered a candidate technology for building wireless backhauls, particularly to provide high-speed and low-cost connectivity in remote areas. To study E-band long-range propagation properties that are crucial for backhaul communications, we have developed a channel-sounding system that operates at 74 GHz, supports a signal bandwidth of 1 GHz, and covers a range of more than 25 km. Using the system, we performed channel measurements in across-lake, desert, and sea environments, all having line-of-sight (LOS) propagation conditions and around 12-km link distances. Based on the multi-environment measurements, we characterize E-band pathloss, fading, polarization, and multipath effects, which are of primary importance for system design. The results show that the E-band pathloss, mainly affected by atmospheric humidity, is considerably different in diverse environments. Vertically polarized propagation has significantly lower attenuation than horizontally polarized. The commonly used ITU-R models fail to predict E-band long-range pathloss for lack of polarization modeling. Severe fading was observed in a very short time and should be considered in the link budget. The cross-polarization ratios (XPRs) are relatively high, indicating a possibility of using polarized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to boost data rates. No significant multipath was observed; however, severe fading implies that strong and unresolvable scattering or refraction exists around the LOS path. The research reveals the feasibility of E-band backhaul communications in those remote environments, and the results contribute to future system design as well as channel modeling.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3463975","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62031008); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1805002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10694751","Channel measurement;E-band;millimeter wave;propagation characterization;wireless backhaul","Backhaul networks;Sea measurements;Radio frequency;Attenuators;Wireless communication;Attenuation;Band-pass filters","","","","64","IEEE","25 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The measurement results are analyzed and validated by ray tracing (RT) simulation. The quasi-optical propagation properties at 300 GHz make an accurate estimation of relatively simple propagation in a corridor environment possible by using ray optics theory. However, even though nontrivial quadruple-bounce specular reflection paths can be identified in both scenarios, propagation phenomena other than reflection exist irrespective of the Rx positions. Thus, to model the propagation mechanism appropriately, a quasi-deterministic (QD) channel model comprising deterministic and random components is also proposed. The results generated using the proposed model are found to agree well with our prior observations and measurement results. Finally, the article concludes by characterizing and comparing the channel for all the investigated scenarios in terms of path loss (PL) and large-scale parameters (LSPs). On analyzing the measurement results using synthesized power spectra, proposed QD model, and evaluated PL and LSP, it is observed that the Access and D2D scenarios share almost similar propagation mechanisms. Furthermore, in the Access and Backhaul scenario, the line-of-sight (LoS) is observed to be affected by the unresolvable ceiling-reflected components.

As a common measurement technique in the mmWave and THz bands, direction-scan sounding (DSS) resolves angular information and increases the measurable distance. Through mechanical rotation, the DSS creates a virtual multiantenna sounding system, which however incurs signal phase instability and large data sizes, which are not fully considered in existing estimation algorithms and thus make them ineffective. To tackle this research gap, in this article, a DSS-oriented space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (DSS-o-SAGE) algorithm is proposed for channel parameter estimation in mmWave and THz bands. To appropriately capture the measured data in mmWave and THz DSS, the phase instability is modeled by the scanning-direction-dependent signal phases. Furthermore, based on the signal model, the DSS-o-SAGE algorithm is developed, which not only addresses the problems brought by phase instability, but also achieves ultralow computational complexity by exploiting the narrow antenna beam property of DSS. Simulations in synthetic channels are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and explore the applicable region of the far-field approximation (FFA) in DSS-o-SAGE. Last but not least, the proposed DSS-o-SAGE algorithm is applied in real measurements in an indoor corridor scenario at 300 GHz. Compared with results using the baseline noise elimination method, the channel is characterized more correctly and reasonably based on the DSS-o-SAGE.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3383718","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Major Scientific Instruments and Equipments Development Project(grant numbers:62027806); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494205","Channel measurement;channel parameter estimation;direction-scan sounding (DSS);sixth-generation (6G) and beyond;space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE);Terahertz (THz) communications","Millimeter wave communication;Channel estimation;Terahertz communications;Antenna measurements;Parameter estimation;Computational modeling;Signal processing algorithms","","8","","43","IEEE","5 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed simulation framework, the open-source tool called Blender is utilized to model dynamic scenarios and render animations. Each frame of the animation is rendered into a picture with a defined number of pixels by the ray tracing (RT) engine embedded in Blender. Then, the distance, strength, angle of arrival (AoA), and motion speed of each pixel are calculated based on the traced rays.

Developing the realistic sub-THz channel model is essential for designing and deploying future 6G communication systems. We presented the channel measurements and characterization of a recent sub-THz channel measurement campaign conducted in an indoor hall scenario at sub-THz bands in this work. The channel measurement campaign was conducted with 55 transmitter (Tx)–receiver (Rx) deployment locations (including two predefined “L”-shape routes) covering the Tx-Rx distance range of  $[{3,58}]$  m at 99–101 GHz using a phase-compensated long-range channel sounder. A channel parameter estimation algorithm is exploited to extract the multipath component (MPC) parameters. The composite channel parameters, i.e., path loss, delay spread, angular spread, and K-factor, are calculated and analyzed using the extracted MPC parameters. It is seen that the spreads of delay and angular and the K-factor statistically obey log-normal distributions and the normal distribution, respectively, and the fitting parameters are concluded for statistical modeling. An MPC trajectory tracking algorithm was also utilized to trace the MPC trajectories in the two routes. The MPC-level channel parameters were then investigated based on the trajectory results.

In this article, we present a wideband A2G channel measurement campaign for fixed-wing UAV with a maximum altitude of 700 m. A comprehensive investigation of channel fading characteristics and channel modeling including path loss, shadow fading, spatial correlation, and small-scale fading is provided. Particularly, unlike terrestrial channels, a strong dependence of shadow fading and small-scale fading on UAV altitude is found. We propose to adopt Gamma distribution for modeling the shadow fading effect that has a similar fitting performance with traditional Log-normal distribution but is more robust for theoretical analysis. Spatial correlation characteristics and modeling are presented. Results reveal that the decorrelation distance of shadow fading increases with the UAV altitude. We propose to use a model combining the exponential and sinusoidal functions that fit well with the autocorrelation function for shadow fading. Further, by using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Cramer-von Mises (CVM) test, and Akaike information criterion (AIC) methods, the Rician distribution is found to be the best candidate for modeling small-scale fading for UAV with altitudes above 300 m.

To ensure measurement accuracy, the designed passive channel sounding system is rigorously calibrated and validated within a compact antenna test range (CATR) before field deployment. The discrepancies between the estimated arrival angles and their preset values do not exceed 1°, and the power deviations are less than 0.8 dB. Furthermore, we propose a digital twin (DT) framework to create precise digital representations of electrical signals received on antennas of investigation through high-precision simulations, ensuring alignment with actual conditions among various locations and orientations for the antennas. The methodology begins with the precise digitization of 5G fading channel environments via the passive channel sounding process. Utilizing the acquired channel parameters and the complex radiation patterns of the targeted antennas, the DTs of the received electrical signals for the antennas can be computed. Field measurements, conducted using a standard dipole for electrical field scanning, validate the DT predictions against measured results. The deviations, measured by the root mean square error (RMSE) of the electrical signal power distribution in the test areas, are less than 1.5 dB for the indoor corridor and 4.5 dB for the outdoor-street environments.

In this article, we present the design and implementation of a coherent distributed massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel sounder operating at 5 and 6GHz with a bandwidth of 400MHz based on the NI USRP X410. Through the integration of multiple transceiver chains and radio frequency (RF) switches, the design facilitates the use of a larger number of antennas without significant compromise in dynamic capability. Our current implementation is capable of measuring thousands of antenna combinations in tens of milliseconds. Every radio frequency switch is seamlessly integrated with a 16-element antenna array, allowing phase-coherent multinode dual-polarized double-directional dynamic channel measurements for multistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. In addition, the channel sounder features real-time processing to reduce the data stream to the host computer and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The correct operation of the sounder is demonstrated through two measurements in an indoor laboratory environment. The first measurement entails a single-antenna robot as a transmitter and 128 distributed receiving antennas. The second measurement demonstrates a passive sensing scenario with a walking person. We evaluate the results of both measurements using the super-resolution algorithm space-alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE).

The study meticulously evaluates 39 unique configurations, using a stationary horn antenna for consistent reference K-factor characterization and considers variables like absorbers and CATR polarization. Results demonstrate that the K-factor can be effectively adjusted in the hybrid setup, maintaining substantial margins above the noise level across all configurations. Sample independence is confirmed for at least 600 samples in all cases. The bootstrap Anderson–Darling (AD) goodness-of-fit (GoF) test verifies that the data align with Rician or Rayleigh distributions. Analysis of total received power, stirred and unstirred power, and frequency-dependent modeling reveals that power variables are inversely related to frequency, while the K-factor remains frequency-independent. The hybrid RC–CATR system achieves a wide range of frequency-averaged K-factors from −9.2 to 40.8 dB, with an average granularity of 1.3 dB. Notably, configurations using co-polarized CATR signals yield large K-factors, reduced system losses, and improved frequency stability, underscoring the system’s efficacy for millimeter-wave over-the-air (OTA) testing.

All follow the general approach of creating the sparsity needed for CS by subtracting the measured far-field (FF) or near-field (NF) of the test array from that of a “gold standard” array measured under identical conditions. In several previous papers the authors have applied CS to planar near-field (PNF) measurements with a view to building a compact test facility well suited to the production environment for these antennas. In this article, we identify a fundamental flaw in the creation of the difference pattern between a gold standard antenna and the test antenna, in that the electrical path length difference between probe and gold standard antenna and that of probe to test antenna must be no more than  $0.002\lambda $  or 0.7°. Even if mechanical tolerance can achieve this, thermal drift in the radio frequency (RF) subsystem will easily reach the 0.7° figure. This article then describes an analysis process that overcomes this problem, restoring the CS process to very nearly the levels of performance described in our previous publications and those of other workers. To achieve this, we have used a fixed set of NF probes located randomly over a region confined to the central part of the NF measurement plane, along with a PIN switch matrix to offer a very rapid and very consistent RF measurement. We have extensively simulated a massive MIMO array of  $8\times 24$  elements and found that just 25 NF probes can detect up to 2% failure rate. In addition, we present a technique to improve the accuracy of the array excitation reconstruction by using several partial excitations of the array. In this work we consider both array element amplitude and phase reconstruction performance and demonstrates that it is possible to detect a single element, phase only, fault of just 22.5°.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3483309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10735094","Antenna measurements;antenna metrology;array antennas;compressive sensing (CS);massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO);planar near-field (PNF) array diagnostics;PNF measurements;sparse sampling","Antenna measurements;Antenna arrays;Noise measurement;Production;Magnetic field measurement;Compressed sensing;Aperture antennas;Gold;Electric fields;Probes","","1","","26","IEEE","24 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Quiet zone performance depends on the quality and arrangement of radio-absorbing materials (RAMs) installed on the chamber’s inner walls and measurement antenna-to-range interface. In practice, reflections within the AC and the coupling between polarizations of a dual-polarized measurement antenna can introduce significant levels of unwanted cross-polarization signals. Although single-polarized antennas are commonly used as probes in quiet zone evaluation, they often overlook the impact of cross-polarization on quiet zone performance. This article proposes an improved method to address this issue and for quiet zone evaluation, using a novel ultra-wideband dual-polarized antenna (NUDA) as a probe antenna. The proposed NUDA operates between 1 and 12 GHz and achieves a comprehensive performance encompassing ultrawideband, dual-polarization, wide beamwidth (greater than 60°), and low common-mode current. Simultaneously, it overcomes the challenges associated with single-polarized antennas and their common-mode current interference, as well as the narrow beamwidth issue with horn antennas at high frequencies. By introducing a switch and switching the polarization of the NUDA, both the copolarization and cross-polarization of the quiet zone can be simultaneously measured at the same location. This provides a more accurate and convenient option for broadband quiet zone evaluation. The feasibility of the proposed method has been demonstrated through both simulation and experimental results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3502916","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFF0604804); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:519390016); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371075); Metrology for Emerging Wireless Standards [European Association of National Metrology Institutes (EURAMET) EPM MEWS Project](grant numbers:21NRM03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10768929","Anechoic chambers (ACs);common-mode current;cross-polarization;novel ultrawideband dual-polarized antenna (NUDA);quiet zone evaluation;wide beamwidth","Antenna measurements;Dipole antennas;Horn antennas;Probes;Wideband;Switches;Reflector antennas;Frequency measurement;Accuracy;Ultra wideband antennas","","","","25","IEEE","26 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Variations in the PWG radio frequency (RF) chains due to active RF components would alter the optimized complex excitation coefficients of PWG, which can inevitably deteriorate the PWG quiet zone (QZ) performance. Therefore, regular calibration of a PWG is essential to maintain optimal PWG QZ performance. However, plane-wave condition, which is typically required for PWG array calibration, is difficult to attain in practical PWG deployment scenarios. To address this challenge, a novel scheme is proposed for in situ calibration of the PWG. The basic idea is to employ a small multiprobe system (i.e., with its aperture smaller than that of the PWG) located within the PWG QZ in the compact setup to emulate an “equivalent probe” much further away from the PWG. The proposed solution is validated in a practical anechoic chamber setup, where a  $3 \times 3$  multiprobe system (with a small aperture of  $0.5 \times 0.5$  m) is employed to calibrate a  $14 \times 9$  PWG (of size  $1.0 \times 1.124$  m) at 2.6 GHz with 0.5-m measurement distance. A good array calibration accuracy is achieved, with a peak-to-peak amplitude error of up to 1.5 dB and a phase error of up to 11.2°, even in the presence of probe placement errors in practical deployment scenarios.

Specifically, the proposed one can train the calibration model based on datasets entirely generated by simulation, and the trained model can be directly applied across various array intervals, frequency bands, and calibration directions, given the same number of array elements. Consequently, the proposed algorithm excels in calibration efficiency as compared to conventional methods. For the verification, the proposed method is applied to the C-band, X-band, K-band, and Ka-band phased arrays that are produced based on our in-house integrated circuits (ICs).

Developed at Office National d’Études et Recherches Aérospatiales (ONERA) under the name EMIR, infrared (IR) thermography involves heating a thin film with EM radiation. An IR camera measures this heating, which is proportional to the EM power density, thereby revealing the field amplitude. More recently, a new thermography technique derived from EMIR has been introduced. This method involves coating the thin film with a fluorophore. The fluorescence intensity, which depends on temperature and thus on the field, allows for mapping of the EM field using a simple optical camera.

Following this, based on the principle of dielectric doping, we doped the metal medium into the ENZ waveguide cavity to realize a waveguide epsilon-mu-near-zero (EMNZ) medium. To apply it to antenna design, an array of slots is transversely etched along the sidewall of the EMNZ waveguide to radiate electromagnetic (EM) wave outwards, thereby constructing an equal spacing ten-element antenna array featuring a simplified feeding network and impedance matching, with simulation confirmed the antenna’s strong directivity.

There is thus potential to see an EBP that exceeds the limitation for an antenna of a given size. The proposed antenna is based on a top-loaded monopole antenna and then utilizes varactor diodes to continuously vary the resonance frequency of the antenna as a function of time. We use a frequency-modulated (FM) input signal that is synchronous to the tuning of the antenna resonance, matching the instantaneous frequency of the input signal to the current resonance of the antenna, thus enabling the transmission of an arbitrary FM signal. We evaluate the performance of the antenna through the use of full-wave solver simulations, equivalent circuit model simulations, and prototype measurements.

The transversal coupling topology allows all the radiative resonators of PRRS to couple to the free space simultaneously. All the resonators are simultaneously excited by the linearly polarized (LP) incidence and reradiate the LP reflection wave with 90° polarization rotation. As a result, the overall frequency response of the PRRS is the superposition of the counterparts of all the resonators. For an Nth-order PRRS, up to  ${N} - 1$  cross-polarization reflection zeros can be achieved using N resonances in the transversal coupling topology. These N resonances can be realized by either single-mode or multimode resonators. Two second-order PRRS designs have been presented to verify the operating principle of PRRS and show the advantages of this design method. Then, the design guideline of the transversal PRRS has been drawn. Furthermore, the three X-band transversal PRRS prototypes exhibiting the third-order, fourth-order, and fifth-order quasi-elliptic bandpass frequency response have been presented. The cross-polarization reflection zeros can be found at both the lower and upper stopband of PRRS, leading to the high roll-off frequency response. To minimize the size of the PRRS unit cell, the dual-mode and triple-mode rectangular ring resonators have been utilized in the three PRRS designs.

Single-band RISs have received lots of attention in academia and industry, however, there are still deficiencies in the applications of multiband signals coexistence. In this article, a dual-band RIS with the capabilities of aperture-shared and filtering is presented to address these inadequacies. First, the aperture-shared schemes are investigated and analyzed, and the embedded arrangement scheme is selected. Second, the dual-band aperture-shared RIS element is designed, and two p-i-n diodes are placed on the split ring and slot-loaded patch to realize independently tunable phase shifts in the lower and higher bands. In addition, a filtering layer is designed to suppress the out-of-band interference and achieve a favorable filtering response in magnitude. Finally, an aperture-shared RIS prototype is fabricated and measured to verify independent phase shifts and filtering performance. The measured results show that 3-dB bandwidths from 4.71 to 5.14 GHz and 6.46 to 7.23 GHz are obtained.

The antenna operates as a patch antenna in the MW band (2.4 GHz) and as a transmitarray (TA) in the MMW band (60 GHz). It was found that the transmitting surface (TS) of the TA can be equivalent to a MW patch at a large frequency ratio, and therefore, the two kinds of antennas can be tightly integrated and share the same radiating aperture through structure reuse. To accommodate the TA into the patch antenna, the TA is folded by adopting a polarization rotating surface (PRS), and its profile height is reduced to 1/3 of the focal length, which matches the profile of the patch antenna. Thanks to the spatial feeding architecture of the TA, the proposed antenna eliminates the need for a complicated feeding network and features low feeding loss and high gain in the MMW band. Additionally, the proposed antenna adopts a pair of differentially fed L-probes for the MW feeding network and a nondispersive stripline for the MMW TA, which contribute to the wideband performance of the antenna in both bands. To validate the design idea, a prototype is fabricated and measured. The experimental results show that it can achieve 3-dB gain bandwidths of 26.3% and 20.1% in the MW and MMW bands, respectively.

Traditionally, the Anderson acceleration (AA) method accelerates convergence in fixed-point iterations by extrapolating solutions from a linear combination of previous iterations. However, different from the fixed-point iteration, whose operator is definite, the mapping operator in the VBIM is approximate and noncontractive. A necessary modification is made by substituting the gradient-acceptance-based strategy in standard AA to the total-quantity-acceptance-based strategy. Additionally, considering the later work in AA demonstrates a damping factor boosts the convergence speed of AA, we present an adaptive damping strategy to further augment the inversion’s convergence rate. The dual-enhancements significantly improve both the speed and robustness of convergence. From a mathematical perspective, the VBIM-ADAA method seeks an exact data equation solution in a subspace spanned by previous regularization solutions during each iteration. Furthermore, the robustness facilitated by VBIM-ADAA permits a broader range of choices for the regularization parameter. By leveraging QR factorization (via the Gram-Schmidt process), we analyze the VBIM-ADAA’s characteristics under different mapping operators. Extensive numerical experiments, involving both synthetic and real-world data, verify the superior convergence, robustness, and better accuracy of the VBIM-ADAA compared to the conventional VBIM. Moreover, numerical experiments demonstrate that the computational time consumed by the ADAA is negligible, which makes it a practical and efficient method for solving ISPs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3528749","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62471120,61721001); Sichuan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2024NSFSC0440); Intelligent Vehicle Safety Technology State Key Laboratory Foundation of China(grant numbers:IVSTSKL-202410); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10845084","Anderson acceleration (AA);inverse scattering problem (ISP);variational Born iterative method (VBIM)","Convergence;Damping;Robustness;Receivers;Iterative methods;Electromagnetics;Inverse problems;Vectors;Standards;Accuracy","","1","","36","IEEE","20 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, a fundamental bound that expresses how large that scattering cross section can be is yet to be found. Approaches based on cascading multiple resonances permitted to push the scattering responses of subwavelength structures and to exceed existing estimators. In this context, the Chu-Harrington criterion is, potentially, the most commonly considered one. The superradiant empirical criterion, addressing scattering performances of near-field coupled resonator arrays, was subsequently developed to tighten existing estimates, setting a new bound that prompted efforts to find structures that exceed it. Here, we demonstrate that genetically designed superscattering structures, encompassing arrays of constructively interfering electric and magnetic dipoles, can build up high scatting cross sections exceeding those imposed by existing criteria in electromagnetic theory, including the superradiant. After undergoing thousands of evolutionary generations, iterating sizes, mutual orientations, and locations of resonators, the structures approach their heuristically maximized performance, which is unlikely to be obtained by a random distribution given more than a billion trials. As an additional practically valuable parameter, the scattering bandwidth also underwent optimization. We demonstrate that flat wavelength-comparable structures can have significant backscattering ( $\sim 4\times $  prevailing the superradiant criterion) alongside more than 40% fractional bandwidth, given an endfire excitation. The result demonstrates the fundamental perspective to untighten scattering cross section from bandwidth limitations. New capabilities of genetic optimization algorithms, equipped with fast computational tools and constrained by experimentally obtainable electromagnetic parameters, allow chasing well-accepted traditional criteria, demonstrating ever-seen electromagnetic performances.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3524423","Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research Global(grant numbers:N6290921-1-2038); Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(grant numbers:1115/23); Latvian Council of Science, Project LIGTHNESS(grant numbers:lzp-2024/1-0253); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10832513","Meta-learning;scatterer;scattering","Optimization;Bandwidth;Resonators;Electromagnetics;Electromagnetic scattering;Metalearning;Wires;Linear programming;Backscatter;Computer architecture","","","","67","IEEE","7 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although significant efforts have been made in the literature to study and model the SWO, there is a gap in the understanding of the interaction between the source and any particular load antenna. In this work, several antennas commonly used with SWO systems are modeled to gain a better understanding of the impact of the antenna’s geometry and impedance on the system’s overall performance. Using a combination of circuit and full-wave modeling, the aspects of the loading antenna that have the greatest impact on overall system performance are identified.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3539450","Commonwealth of Australia as represented by the Defence Science and Technology Group of the Department of Defence; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10884684","Antenna;high-power microwave;switched oscillator (SWO)","Integrated circuit modeling;Load modeling;Oscillators;Antennas;Switches;Loaded antennas;Analytical models;Power transmission lines;Antenna radiation patterns;Impedance","","","","29","IEEE","13 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the number of switches increases in modern wireless communication and sensing systems, such as reconfigurable antenna arrays and large intelligent reflective surfaces for 5G wireless communications and microwave holography, static power consumption becomes enormous, resulting in low system power efficiency and requiring thermal dissipation management, which not only hinders their applications but also increases operational costs. To address this issue, nonvolatile switches enabled reconfigurable  $6\times 6$  metasurface with zero static power consumption is demonstrated.

The presence of dielectrics in the proximity of the metal layers affects the equivalent layer capacitance and thus must be accurately taken into account for the modeling and design of the ADLs. The proposed procedure allows to derive an analytical expression for the effective permittivity of each capacitive layer that depends on the dielectric layers in the vicinity of the metal. The equivalent layer capacitance can then be included in the ADL equivalent transmission line model, which can be used, for instance, for the design of matching structures in ultrawideband arrays.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3529196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10847736","Artificial dielectric layers (ADLs);effective permittivity;spectral domain method;stratified media;wideband arrays","Dielectrics;Permittivity;Capacitance;Metals;Admittance;Slabs;Power transmission lines;Antennas and propagation;Antenna arrays;Magnetic domains","","","","20","IEEE","20 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The periodic leaky wave antenna (PLWA) with the −2nd SH instead of −1st SH as the main radiation mode is proposed. Extracting the dispersion characteristics is a crucial step in designing and analyzing the antenna. To accurately extract dispersion characteristics, a method named improved macro- and single-cell method (IMCSM), which combines the improved macro-cell method (IMCM) with the single-cell method is proposed. The optimized method takes into account both coupling effects and certain timeliness. An alternative way for suppressing the open stopband of the main mode is presented, by enhancing the open stopband of the −1st mode. Using IMSCM, the traditional PLWA with the rampart line is improved. A wide scanning range of up to 145° and measured gain of up to 15.1 dBi are achieved. The measured radiation patterns show that the main beam scans continuously from −73° to 72° and from 6.6 to 11 GHz, showing a good agreement with the analyses and theory of IMSCM.
