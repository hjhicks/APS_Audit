Design guidelines, derived from an accurate frequency-dispersive uniaxial tensor model of periodic dual-layer planar stacks, allow optimization of the key lens parameters-disk number, permittivity, thickness, diameter, and interdisk spacing. Several SDLs designed at 5 GHz using these guidelines, exhibiting stopband thresholds between 6.6 and 13 GHz, −3-dB fractional gain lens-antenna bandwidths ranging from 46.6% to 81.1% and aperture efficiencies between 44.5% and 58.8%, are illustrated. Full-wave simulations, employing a locally conformal finite-integration technique (FIT), show interdisk field propagation, diffraction, field focusing, and stopband behaviors. A novel time-domain metric, the proportional-derivative energy fidelity factor (PDEFF), is introduced to quantify received field waveform quality at the lens focus region, achieving 95%–99% for ultrawideband through-the-wall imaging and 92%–94% for ultrawideband (UWB) waveforms (for lenses having stopband thresholds near and above 10 GHz). An antenna prototype incorporating an SDL design approaches a peak gain of 17 dBi (approximately 10 dB attributable to the lens) and an 87% weight reduction relative to a conventional massive lens, confirming numerical simulation predictions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3566246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10990306","Dielectric lens;dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs);field fidelity factor;Maxwell fisheye lens;off body elliptical lens (OBELs);shaped single shell lens (SSSLs);spherical-axicon dielectric lens (SADLs);ultrawideband (UWB);uniaxial medium;wideband antennas;wireless communications","Lenses;Dielectrics;Permittivity;Tensors;Periodic structures;Focusing;Dielectric resonator antennas;Benchmark testing;Gain;Electromagnetics","","","","35","IEEE","7 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The 2-D array is decomposed into several 1-D row subarrays realized on a multilayered dielectric-substrate panel. To produce sufficient space for active RF transceiver module accommodation, the 1-D row subarrays are designed to radiate endfire patterns from along the edge direction of the dielectric panel such that the space behind the antenna can be freely used with limitations. Afterward, several panels of the 1-D row subarrays are stacked vertically to form the 2-D AiP array by utilizing glued dummy wafers (GDWs) or low-temperature soldering (LTS) ball grid arrays (BGAs), whose thickness may produce a cavity to accommodate the RF transceivers and build the RF signal paths in AiP operation. After the stack up of forming a rectangular array, the antenna is turned around by 90° to face upward, which transforms the endfire radiation into a broadside one, as desired by the ordinary AiP. This AiP has dual-linear polarization (dual-LP) radiations that can align with the base station antenna for polarization matching.

A dual-port design is first studied which employs the loading effect of the feeding probe to modify the E-field distributions of the dielectric resonator (DR)  $ {\text {TE}}_{{3}\delta {1}}^{y}$  mode. The interaction between the probe-loaded and DR modes results in the formation of a quasi-fundamental mode  ${\text {TE}}_{{1}\delta {1}}^{y}$  and a weak field region at the coupled port, leading to stable radiation patterns for each port with high port isolation. Additionally, metal vias is used to surround the DR to reduce cross-polarization. Also, the metal vias form electric walls which can reduce the DR size effectively. A hole is introduced at the center of the DR to further enhance the isolation. Based on the dual-port antenna element, a  $2\times 3$ -port multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array with a center-to-center distance of  $0.49\lambda _{0}$  is developed. To improve isolation between adjacent elements, a leaky wave decoupling structure and two strips are introduced, increasing the isolation by 11 dB. Both the antenna element and the MIMO array were fabricated to validate the designs. Experimental results indicate that the −10-dB impedance bandwidth and isolation level of the dual-port antenna element are 6% and 24.4 dB, respectively. For the  $2\times 3$ -port MIMO array, the −10-dB bandwidth and isolation level are 5% and 20 dB, respectively.

This phenomenon is due to the radiation cancellation caused by the out-of-phase currents between the parasitic element and the main radiator. This article proposes a solution by introducing another parasitic element near the initial one and enabling them to resonate in differential mode (DM), and the radiation cancellation at the efficiency dip can be significantly mitigated without attenuating bandwidth expansion. To illustrate this method, an ultrathin dual-polarized microstrip antenna is presented as an example. By designing a pair of L-shaped parasitic strips and converting the parasitic mode from common mode (CM) to DM, the in-band gain variation is reduced from 5.8 to 1.9 dB. The measured results show that the antenna operates with an impedance bandwidth of 2.3% in an extremely low profile of  $0.008~\lambda _{L}$  ( $\lambda _{L}$  is the free-space wavelength at 7.9 GHz). The proposed method mitigates efficiency dips caused by the parasitic elements, exhibiting a feasible solution for bandwidth expansion of ultrathin microstrip antennas while holding the high efficiency.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3564006","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFA0716601); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U22B2016); Huawei Technologies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10981546","Antenna radiation efficiency;common and differential modes (DMs);microstrip antennas;wideband antennas","Microstrip antennas;Antennas;Microstrip;Bandwidth;Gain;Resonant frequency;Broadband antennas;Patch antennas;Impedance;Couplings","","","","42","IEEE","30 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This analysis demonstrates that dual-CP radiation and filtering properties can be achieved and improved with the coupled dual-mode resonators in the MSDRT, eliminating the need for additional feeding networks or polarizers, and thereby realizing a high-integrated structure. Moreover, the analysis also reveals that MSDRT provides multiple transmission paths between the filtenna ports through dual-mode resonators and nonresonating modes (NRMs). The cancellation of these paths can generate transmission zeros controllably, thereby achieving high port isolation. Then, two MSDRT dual-CP filtennas are implemented based on substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavities and patches.

The antenna consists of three folded structures: one narrow closed loop and two split loops. One of the split loops has a narrow width with its opening at the bottom, while the other split loop has a wider width with its opening at the top. The latter features folded PIFA-like structures. All these structures are connected in parallel and etched on a one-layer substrate. Due to the field’s cancellation, the design generates three radiation nulls near the passband, realizing filtering responses. The antenna achieves a measured −10-dB impedance bandwidth of 12.0% and exhibits omnidirectional radiation patterns. Its measured total efficiency within the passband is 87.4%, while the suppression level in the stopband exceeds 18.8 dB. This basic omnidirectional filtering design is extended to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) array designs. By loading decoupling meander lines between closely spaced elements ( $\lt 0.02\lambda _{0}$ ), port isolations are increased by over 9.6 dB. Moreover, the distorted radiation patterns are significantly improved. A prototype of the  $1\times 4$  MIMO array was fabricated and tested to verify the idea. A reasonable agreement between measured and simulated results was obtained. This MIMO array has couplings lower than −19.8 dB with rectangular coefficients below 1.35.

The research reveals that, by designing the phase gradient of PB metasurface, the feeding surface wave (SW) can be efficiently converted to radiation wave along the expected direction. In addition, the polarization of radiation wave can be arbitrarily customized by further designing the row phase gradients of PB metasurface. On the other hand, the amplitude of radiation wave can also be controlled by adjusting the polarization conversion ratio (PCR) of PB elements and thus realizing the sidelobe suppression of far-field radiation pattern. Benefit from the inherent asymmetry of the PB elements and the asymmetrical periodic arrangement, the open-stopband (OSB) effect of LWA can be eliminated spontaneously.

In this article, a six-element CP array with a rotationally symmetric layout is designed for the Beidou navigation system. The coupling mechanism between CP array elements is intuitively revealed using the orthogonal mode decomposition (OMD) method. In this way, the mutual coupling can be characterized by two coupled modes: a spatial coupled mode (SCM) and a ground coupled mode (GCM). Furthermore, coplanar dual decoupling lines with very compact sizes are proposed for decoupling the adjacent array elements. The SCM and GCM are simultaneously suppressed by the novel structure. Consequently, the isolation between adjacent CP array elements is improved from 12.5 to 45 dB. Benefiting from the improvement of isolation, the realized gain of the CP array element is improved from 2.0 to 4.1 dBic, and the AR is also improved from 2.6 to 1.6 dB. Moreover, the decoupling structures can be placed on the same layer of the patch elements.

In comparison experiments, the proposed method outperforms typical population-based stochastic optimization algorithms and deep neuron network (DNN) structure in both synthesis efficiency and pattern regularity. The model’s real-time capability is verified for beam reconfiguration scenarios requiring subsecond responses, suggesting a new pathway for physics-embedded deep learning in antenna array synthesis.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3564705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10982437","Beamforming;convolutional networks;deep learning;planar arrays","Training;Antenna radiation patterns;Planar arrays;Deep learning;Convolutional neural networks;Neural networks;Stochastic processes;Real-time systems;Optimization;Arrays","","","","40","IEEE","2 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the method guarantees that the radiation energy in the far-field region is maximized, the energy distribution of the multiple beams can be controlled by adjusting the weights introduced during the optimization process. A new performance indicator is introduced and optimized to suppress the sidelobe level (SLL) of the shaped pattern based on the extended method of maximum power transmission efficiency (EMMPTE). Moreover, the weights are adaptively searched by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to precisely control the SLLs and the gain distributions of the multiple beams in the designated region to meet various design requirements. As a verification, the radiation patterns of single- and dual-beam configurations with SLL suppressions, and a tri-beam configuration with specific gain distributions, are studied by using a 12-element linear antenna array. The optimized distributions of excitations obtained from the method are realized by a digital feeding circuit. The measured results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of shaping the main beams and controlling the sidelobes in the targeted directions, providing a new and efficient strategy for pattern synthesis. Compared to optimizing the excitations of antenna arrays to achieve desired shaped patterns directly using PSO or other optimization algorithms, the optimization procedure implemented in this article requires significantly less computational time due to the reduced number of variables and iterations involved, especially for large antenna arrays.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3566201","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101276); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971231); Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves of Southeast University(grant numbers:K202524); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10990316","Array radiation pattern;multiple beams;sidelobe control","Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays;Optimization;Electric fields;Linear antenna arrays;Microstrip antenna arrays;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Training;Simulation;Power transmission","","1","","27","IEEE","7 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a 5-D tensor is defined to incorporate the 2-D spatial information from transmit UPA (TUPA) and receive UPA (RUPA), which is then combined with temporal information. Next, a low-rank 4-D tensor is generated by performing an autocorrelation operation along the temporal dimension of the 5-D tensor, forming a structure that encapsulates the difference coarrays of the TUPA and RUPA. Then, a TTD framework is designed to decompose the 4-D tensor into interconnected lower order TT-cores. Furthermore, a precise bidirectional mapping is performed between the TT-cores and the original Vandermonde factor matrices. Finally, leveraging distinct combinations of TT-cores, two innovative methods are developed to recover the Vandermonde factor matrices. The proposed methods conduct automatic pairing of 2D-DOD and obtain 2D-DOA estimates by enforcing consistent permutation orders across all factor matrices.

The proposed antenna consists of an medium-high band (MHB) antenna and a GPS L1/WiFi-2.4 antenna. Both the MHB antenna and the GPS L1/WiFi-2.4 antenna are composed of an inverted-F antenna (IFA) and a parasitic branch. Each IFA is shorted to the ground via a capacitor. Also, a neutralization line is linked between the MHB antenna and the GPS L1/WiFi-2.4 antenna. The parasitic branches and the grounding capacitors introduce radiation nulls to improve the isolations at the GPS L1 and the MHB band. The neutralization line improves the isolation at the WiFi-2.4 band. A fabricated prototype demonstrates that, by employing the parasitic branches, decoupling capacitors, and neutralization line, the high isolations of 25 and 30 dB at GPS L1 and WiFi-2.4 bands, respectively, are achieved.

This study proposes a highly miniaturized implantable antenna with quad-band characteristics. The implantable antenna’s volume is  $6\times 6\times 0.6$  mm. The proposed antenna operates in the Medical Implant Communication System (MICS) band (401–406 MHz), Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS) (1427–1432 MHz), and industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands (433.1–434.8 MHz, 902–928 MHz, and 2400–2483.5 MHz) for multitasking, such as data telemetry, wireless power transfer, and control signaling. This design achieves miniaturization using meandered lines, eliminating the need for shortening vias or ground plane slots, typically employed in implantable antennas for size reduction. This arrangement simplifies the structure and minimizes back radiation, enhancing overall performance. The proposed antenna was thoroughly analyzed through simulations integrated into a wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) device.

In this article, we develop an RIS at C band that operates with a transverse-electric (TE) polarization and can shape the radiation pattern at a single plane with high accuracy, in addition to the more conventional beamsteering functionalities. The beamforming is facilitated by subwavelength unit cells that allow the excitation of auxiliary surface waves in the vicinity of the RIS. Importantly, these evanescent fields are predicted and harnessed through an integral-equation framework used for the analysis and optimization of the RIS. A fabricated prototype demonstrates beamsteering up to ±60° with an average illumination efficiency of 95% and sector patterns with a varying beamwidth (ranging from 30° to 60°) that verify the full-wave simulations.

In this work, we introduce a novel and practical method for generating tunable Airy beams by simply proportionally adjusting the phase of a specially designed lens. This approach enables direct and precise control of the beam’s trajectory through straightforward proportional phase modulation, eliminating the need for complex modulation schemes and costly components. We fabricated three lens prototypes using high-precision 3-D printing technology to validate our method. Each lens transforms an incident plane wave into an Airy beam following a distinct parabolic trajectory determined by the proportional phase modulation.

A polarization conversion unit cell, capable of receiving linearly polarized (LP) incidence and transmitting CP radiation, is first designed. Based on the geometric phase (GP) compensation strategy, a full 360° transmission phase with good CP radiation performance is achieved by rotating the transmitting element. Moreover, the quad-focal phase compensation scheme is implemented to construct the GP phase distribution required by 2-D beam scanning to minimize the scanning loss of the transmitarray. To lower the SLL during large-angle beam scanning, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is further employed to refine the phase distribution across the transmitting layer. For validation, a fully functional prototype of the proposed transmitarray illuminated by a movable LP horn is fabricated and measured.

Therefore, traditional nonuniform antenna array synthesis methods are usually based on isolated element patterns and do not consider mutual coupling effects. It will inevitably cause various errors in radiation performance, especially for nonuniform antenna arrays with close element spacings. In this article, a machine learning (ML)-assisted method is proposed for the synthesis of large nonuniform antenna arrays in the presence of mutual coupling. An equivalent small array (ESA) model is developed to predict the element patterns considering mutual coupling under arbitrary array layouts. Compared with traditional ML-assisted methods, the proposed method establishes an efficient and accurate offline model to significantly reduce the full-wave simulation time for training dataset development. The remaining optimization procedure does not require full-wave simulation. Furthermore, the ESA model could be directly applied to antenna arrays with various antenna element numbers and spacings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through linear and planar antenna arrays. Numerical and experimental results demonstrated that the mutual coupling is fully considered in the synthesis method and the synthesis results highly agree with the full-wave simulation and measurement results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3555882","China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(grant numbers:BX20230062); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023M740506); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U23A20289,62431007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10962289","Machine learning (ML);mutual coupling;nonuniform antenna arrays","Antenna arrays;Linear antenna arrays;Mutual coupling;Optimization;Layout;Predictive models;Training;Antennas;Couplings;Planar arrays","","","","39","IEEE","10 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Periodic characteristic mode analysis (PCMA) is implemented to reveal the scattering mechanisms, using an X-band (8.0–12.0 GHz) antenna array as an illustration. It is found that the scattering at 8.0 GHz primarily comes from the center of the ground plane, while the scattering at 12.0 GHz is dominated by the edges of the ground plane. To reduce the scattering at 8.0 GHz, interdigital patches are integrated over the radiation aperture to create a reverse current that counteracts the scattering current on the ground plane. In addition, parasitic patches with shorting pins are introduced to convert the horizontal current into the vertical current, further suppressing the scattering at 12.0 GHz. The suppression technique is applicable for linear antenna arrays with small transverse dimensions. It does not increase the profile height and can enhance the gain of the array. The effectiveness of this technique is validated through a  $2\times 8$  finite array. The antenna array operates in the 8.0–12.0-GHz range with a scanning range of ±45°.

Due to the incident wave angle and the curved surface shape, elements exist scattering shadow regions. Therefore, we investigate the spatial direction and distribution of the scattering fields from subarrays composed of 1-bit elements, while analyzing the formation mechanism of the scattering shadow regions. By incorporating wave path and reflection phase changes induced by structural bending, we establish an accurate theoretical model to compute the far-field scattering pattern of CCMs. To validate the approach, a CCM based on a graphene-assembled film (GAF) with ultrahigh conductivity and excellent mechanical properties such as flexibility and lightweight is used to fabricate the designs. The flexible GAF can provide additional spatial freedom through structural bending, enabling curvature-based scattered beam manipulation without requiring other active devices.

The phase difference between on and off states remains  $180^{\circ }~\pm ~20^{\circ }$  from 5.09 to 5.62 GHz. The RIUC has stable reflection loss in the scene of high resistance of the p-i-n diode in on state, because the current flowing through the p-i-n diode is very small, compared to the total current of the RIUC. This property is utilized to reduce the forward biasing current, thus achieving low power consumption. A  $16\times 16$  RRA prototype is fabricated.

First, the working principle about how to move these four modes closely to each other in resonant frequency is deeply studied, the results prove that the shorting pins and slots could be loaded on the radiator for frequency reallocation of these four modes. Second, the radiation pattern transformation of the MPA at TM00, TM20, and TM21 modes are deeply investigated, which demonstrates that the non-broadside beam of its TM21 mode could be reshaped into the broadside one, and the omnidirectional pattern of its TM00 mode could be reshaped into the dual beam at yoz plane. Most importantly, the radiation pattern of its TM20 mode could be rotated into the dual-beam with co-polarized  ${E} _{\theta }$  component at yoz plane. With these arrangements, the broadside-beam and dual-beam could be excited under same frequency at different modes. Third, based on these two beams with different phases at two ports, the antenna element has successfully gained the improved beam scanning and gain performance simultaneously.

The proposed bidirectional IBFD TRA can theoretically double the throughput and quadruple the spectral reuse efficiency of the IBFD communication system equipped with it. The IBFD TRA is built by a bidirectional full-duplex array and two feeding horns positioned on both sides of the array. One horn connects the Tx chain and the other connects the Rx chain. The unit of the array is constructed by a bidirectional full-duplex quad-mode topology structure which has two orthogonal modes in both forward and backward directions. The orthogonal modes are used to build Tx and Rx channels in both directions which can greatly reduce the self-interference. Therefore, the simultaneous transmit and receive and Tx/Rx self-interference cancellation in both directions can be completed at the element level, avoiding interleave of the Tx and Rx, and a high aperture efficiency can be eventually achieved by arranging the proposed bidirectional unit into an array.

However, the amplitudes and phases at different harmonic frequencies are often mutually affected, which poses challenges for independent control of multiple harmonic beams. To address this issue, this article introduces a novel multibeam TMA with subarrayed time-segmented pseudorandom modulation (STPM). By dividing the ideal continuously varied modulating waveforms into multiple time segments and approximating these time-segmented waveforms with pseudorandom modulation, the proposed STPM enables subarrays to achieve accurate amplitude-phase weightings at different harmonics. Multibeam radiation in this case could be obtained by the superposition of the harmonic beams of different subarrays. Benefiting from the low-sideband property inherited from pseudorandom modulation, the proposed SPTM effectively reduces the amplitude-phase dependence among different harmonics. A multibeam pattern synthesis strategy is then developed to analytically determine the instantaneous modulation statuses of antenna elements for specified beam-scanning angles and sidelobe levels (SLLs). Compared with state-of-the-art TMAs, the presented TMA facilitates high-precision, real-time, and independent multibeam control with a significantly reduced number of modulation statuses in time modulation modules.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3562928","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62401122,U23A20289,62431007); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2025ZNSFSC1434); China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(grant numbers:BX20230062); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023M740506); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10979279","Beam scanning;multibeam pattern synthesis;sideband radiation;time-modulated antenna array (TMA)","Harmonic analysis;Modulation;Radio frequency;Frequency modulation;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays;Array signal processing;Antennas;Frequency synthesizers;Time-frequency analysis","","","","44","IEEE","28 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The numerical experiments show that this method can generate patterns whose main lobe covers the range from 45° to 135° on nonuniform linear arrays (NULAs) with 15–30 isotropic elements, while controlling the SLL below 15 dB, effectively improving the directivity of the antenna array.

The AMS is located in the middle of the element, and the PMS is divided into top and bottom parts (PMSt and PMSb) by AMS. By using polarization grids, the AMS and PMS hardly interfere with each other. Loading a varactor diode in AMS allows its resonance characteristics to be flexibly regulated. By changing the capacitance of the diode, the transmission/reflection amplitude of the RE can be adjusted to any ratio. Then, the PMSb independently controls the reflection phase. On this basis, an arbitrary transmission phase can be achieved by adjusting the PMSt. Therefore, the proposed RE can independently control the transmission/reflection amplitude and phase response. For instance, based on the proposed RE, a  $15\times 15$  metasurface is designed.

By employing the deep Q-network (DQN) technique to tile domino-shaped subarrays into an array aperture, the exact phase distribution over the aperture can be derived. Furthermore, to get better performance of the scanning radiation patterns as well as improve the optimization efficiency, a novel phase-only gradient-descent optimization method is integrated with the DRL training procedure to effectively evaluate the pattern synthesis performance of the tiling configuration. Through the proposed framework by combining DQN and phase-only gradient-descent iterative algorithm, the optimal configuration for the target radiation pattern can be efficiently optimized since the subarray tiling and optimization can be realized simultaneously. The good performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated through several case studies involving  $16\times 16$ ,  $32\times 32$ , and  $64\times 64$ -D domino-shaped arrays.

Tan","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"5 Aug 2025","2025","73","8","5698","5707","This article presents the single gauge-invariant electric field-impulse  $\boldsymbol {I} {}_{E}$  as the retarded solution of its wave equation, which embeds all fields and potentials for current and charge distributions. Many traditional wave equations for electromagnetic (EM) fields, Lorenz- and Coulomb-gauge potentials, can be combined into or simplified via a single wave equation for  $\boldsymbol {I} {}_{E}$ . This wave equation is universal and gauge-invariant, which bypasses all gauge conditions for potentials and includes Poisson equations as its special cases for static charge-integrator and direct current. The retarded wave solution  $\boldsymbol {I} {}_{E}$  is provided in complete and convenient expressions involving current and charge-integrator (instead of charge). It is shown that the single  $\boldsymbol {I} {}_{E}$  actually carries the complete information of all electrostatic, magnetostatic, and electrodynamic fields. Thus, it can aptly describe all EMs simultaneously and provide their ultimate unification, by embedding not only electrodynamics but also electrostatics and magnetostatics. In particular, for the traditional wave equations for EM fields, the solutions derived by Jefimenko and their variants can be unified in the single quantity  $\boldsymbol {I} {}_{E}$ . This unification also applies to the classical electrostatic and magnetostatic solutions named after Coulomb, Poisson, and Biot-Savart, since they all can be embedded simultaneously as parts of the same single quantity  $\boldsymbol {I} {}_{E}$ . For the solutions of traditional wave equations for potentials, including those for Lorenz and Coulomb gauges, they can also be merged uniquely in the same gauge-invariant  $\boldsymbol {I} {}_{E}$ . Applications of electric field-impulse are demonstrated for embedding and unifying all the electric and magnetic fields for Hertzian electric and magnetic dipoles. Numerical results further highlight the completeness of  $\boldsymbol {I} {}_{E}$  in contrast to the inadequacy of fields to describe all EM phenomena.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3568097","Ministry of Education, Singapore, through Academic Research Fund Tier 1(grant numbers:RG49/21); Tertiary Education Research Fund(grant numbers:MOE2021-TRF-019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11004485","Electric scalar potential;electromagnetic (EM) theory;EM field;field-impulse;magnetic vector potential","Propagation;Electric potential;Magnetostatics;Electrostatics;Magnetostatic waves;Electrodynamics;Electromagnetics;Vectors;Electric fields;Magnetic separation","","","","43","IEEE","14 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed sensor can detect the appearance of liquids and its volume based on the liquid’s permittivity (from 1 to 15) using only resonant peaks of  $S_{11}$ . Furthermore, it is capable of simultaneously executing sensing and identification, i.e., the measurement results can be linked with the unique tags ID.

Furthermore, utilizing non-CPA schemes, one can achieve the detection of glucose solution concentration and the detection of external pressure using the photoelastic effect by the observation of resonance frequency. More importantly, the designed PSM has great advantages in the detection performance, such as the linear range (LR), sensitivity, quality (Q), figure of merit (FOM), and detection limit (DL), which will be precisely described by the calculation of the transfer matrix method.

In addition, by choosing the rescaling coefficients of the quasi-Helmholtz components appropriately, we prevent the typical loss of accuracy occurring at low frequency in the presence of inductive and capacitive type magnetic frill excitations, commonly used in circuit modeling to impose a potential difference. Finally, because it relies on quasi-Helmholtz projectors instead of the standard loop-star decomposition, our formulation can be used for modeling multiply connected geometries, without incurring the computational overhead caused by the search for the global loops of the structure, while also being compatible with most fast solvers.

In this work, we propose two novel adaptive methods exploiting a block matrix function which is a key part of the Loewner framework generating system approach. The first algorithm leverages an inherent matrix parameter freedom in the block matrix function to identify frequency points with large errors, whereas the second utilizes the condition number of the block matrix function.

Our comparison of the radio channel responses from the measurements and the original 3GPP channel model, along with their variants adapted to sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequency at 142 GHz in indoor and outdoor environments, sheds light on the possible improvement of the model. The original model defines cluster azimuth angles such that stronger clusters are always concentrated around a reference direction. Meanwhile, the measured azimuth power spectrum indicates that strong clusters randomly come from any direction. An alternative approach to iteratively generate cluster angles is, therefore, proposed, which provides improved agreement of the angular spread and eigenvalue statistics between measured and generated channels, at the expense of increased computational complexity in generating clusters. Moreover, the number of rays has no significant impact on the eigenvalue statistics.

From this operator factorization, we develop a high-order approximate, vector Helmholtz propagator that correctly handles forward arc, high-angle scattering, and diffraction from inhomogeneities at all resolved length scales and seamlessly includes evanescent waves. Our implementation of the exponential operator form of the one-way propagator is discussed extensively. A rational approximation/partial fraction decomposition of the exponential operator converts the propagator into a moderate number of large, sparse, linear solves whose results are summed together at each step to advance the electric field in space. We use a new AAA-Lawson rational interpolant for this approximation, rather than the more common Padé expansions that have appeared in the seismic and ocean acoustics literature previously. GMRES is used to solve these large systems. A direct-solve, free-space propagation method proves to be an effective preconditioner for GMRES, but can also serve as a standalone propagator in homogeneous media. Scalar computational examples shown include plane-wave diffraction by a circular aperture and Gaussian beam propagation through sine-product and homogeneous refractive index fields. The sine-product example compares its results to that of paraxial propagation through the same media and demonstrates the substantial differences between these propagator paradigms when the scale of the inhomogeneities is of the order of the fundamental wavelength in the Helmholtz equation.

Instead of measuring multiple steered beams sequentially in a time-consuming way, some fast multibeam test methods were presented in the literature by the synthesis of complex element patterns measured. However, the complex measurement of array element patterns is challenged by the integrated design of phased arrays and the susceptible phase measurement at millimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies. To address this issue, this article proposes an amplitude-only measurement method of a complex transmission matrix in a near-field setup. The rotating-element electric-field vector (REV) measurement is first conducted on the probe array side to obtain the relative transmission coefficients from AUT array to multiple probe branches. With one probe branch enabled each time, REV measurement is then conducted on AUT array side to obtain the relative transmission coefficients from multiple AUT element branches to a single probe branch. By combining the relative relationships above, the complex transmission matrix between AUT elements and probes is obtained, which is required to reconstruct the complex element patterns for multibeam pattern test of phased arrays. Besides, this article addresses the ambiguity issue of REV solutions by the postprocessing calculation on the original REV measurement data, without extra dedicated measurements for the solution distinction.

Recovering the time-varying phase modulation signal of metasurfaces from radar echoes is crucial for understanding modulation patterns or suppressing modulation effects. To address this problem, we introduce an optimization-based deconvolution approach in this article. First, an optimization model for recovering phase modulation signals from metasurfaces is established by combining the least-squares (LS) deconvolution principle, total variation in the modulating signal, and imaginary part constraint. Furthermore, a composite optimization approach (COA) to solve the deconvolution optimization problem is developed, in which the alternating minimization and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) frameworks are integrated to estimate the complex propagation loss and the modulation phase sequence. In addition, the convergence and computational complexity analysis of the proposed COA is conducted.

Most existing research on mobile satellite antennas focuses on circular polarization (CP), frequency band coverage, and miniaturization; however, little attention is given to beam control, and an ideal satellite antenna’s beam should be directed toward the satellites or fully cover the upper hemisphere. This work proposes a simple method to enhance the upper hemisphere ratio (UHR) by modifying the traditional inverted-L antenna (ILA). A large inductor embedded in the aperture and a small capacitor loaded at the port successfully transform operation mode from the quarter-wavelength unbalanced mode to the half-wavelength balanced mode, which significantly reduces ground currents while allowing the ground to function as a reflector. Consequently, the UHR is greatly improved regardless of ground position and ground size. The antenna test and GPS reception outfield experiment are conducted under two cases with the maximum and the minimum improvement effects in a tablet environment. Significant benefits are achieved using a simple method: compare to the traditional IFA, the proposed UHR is improved by 23.4%/15.4% and the number of detectable satellites is increased by 17%–40%. Compared to the existing sky-oriented satellite antennas, the modified ILA has significant advantages of smaller size and compatibility with metal bezels.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3524719","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101427); Shaanxi S&T Innovation Team(grant numbers:2023-CX-TD-03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10834528","Balanced mode;inverted-L antenna (ILA);mobile satellite antenna;unbalanced mode;upper hemisphere ratio (UHR)","Satellites;Satellite antennas;Mobile antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Smart phones;Antennas;Directive antennas;Global Positioning System;Tablet computers;Inductors","","","","26","IEEE","8 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, two algorithms (CRICO-I and -II) are introduced to reduce the time cost of synthesizing UWB arrays by reasonably selecting the decreased sidelobe constraints. Specifically, the CRICO-I adaptively chooses the sidelobe region that corresponds to lobes with high peak level as the sidelobe constraint domain, and the CRICO-II selects the sidelobe region above a prescribed threshold level as the sidelobe constraint domain. Other sidelobe constraints outside the selected sidelobe constraint domain are removed. In addition, a few refined steps are performed in which array layouts are successively optimized in each step, where the UWB array’s pattern is renewed by multiplying the array factor with currently updated element positions and the active element patterns (AEPs) obtained in the previous refined step. In such a way, the MC effect is incorporated into the synthesis process. Two examples of synthesizing UWB beam-scanning linear and planar arrays with different array sizes and beam-scanning ranges are conducted.

Multiple reflection interference between the probe and the antenna under test (AUT) is a common error source in near-field measurement. The recently introduced scanning optic-induced plasma scattering (SOPS) technology exhibits significant susceptibility to interference, which adversely impacts its measurement precision. The SOPS technique enables the efficient acquisition of near-field distribution data across a sequence of multiple planes. In this communication, we take advantage of this high efficiency and propose a 3-D plane wave spectrum filtering-assisted near-field measurement method. The measured near-field data at different distances were first decomposed through plane wave expansion theory. Then, based on different behaviors between the original wave and the reflected waves at various distances, multiple reflected wave components were filtered out in the spatial spectrum along the distance dimension to suppress the multiple reflection interference between the AUT and the silicon wafer. A typical Ka-band antenna was simulated and measured using the proposed method. The filtered near-field distribution and far-field pattern agree well with the simulation results. The 3-D plane wave spectrum filtering-assisted SOPS technology enables near-field measurements to be completed within a few minutes.

We, herein, proposed a novel cross-type multifocus phase compensation method to modulate the wavefront phase and increase the proportion of transmitted phase linear term to enlarge the beam steering angle.

In general, phase center alignment with the geometric center of the rotating platform is necessary for antenna phase pattern measurement. For an antenna array, it is not convenient to do this for each antenna element. Moreover, achieving accurate phase center alignment cannot be guaranteed in practice. To address this, a phase-center-alignment-free phase pattern consistency measurement method is presented. In this method, an assumption is proposed that when the wave path difference between the array element phase reference points and the rotating platform center is accurately compensated, the phase pattern difference among the elements within the main radiation area will be minimum. Based on this assumption, we designed an optimization criterion to estimate the geometric offset parameter values using synthetic array measurement data and prior element position information. Then, phase pattern consistency is calculated by correcting wave path difference for each element.

A stub load (SL) dual-band structure and an oblique slot line (OSL) structure are introduced in the patch for additional filtering. The SL structure is designed for the coexistence of the TM01 mode and an equivalent TE01 mode within a patch. Both modes resonate at their respective half-wavelength fundamental modes, avoiding a large electrical size. The resonant frequencies of these modes can be independently adjusted. Furthermore, the OSL structure is designed in the patch which splits the original TM01 mode into two modes with approximately spatially complementary field distributions. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the OSL provides a controllable out-of-band radiation null (RN) point. The working mechanism of the SL and OSL is analyzed, providing the principle of controlling the RN. By selecting an appropriate location for the OSL, the higher-order TM20 mode can be suppressed, further deepening the out-of-band rejection between the two operating bands. To enhance the suppression performance in the higher-frequency band, an additional RN is introduced through a U-shaped slot.

However, after their discretization via the boundary element method (BEM), the spectra and eigenvectors of resulting matrices are not usually representative of those of underlying surface integral operators, which can be problematic for methods that rely heavily on spectral properties. To address this issue, the spectrum of the integral operators can be recovered, while preserving symmetry, using square roots and inverse square roots of Gram matrices. In this work, several algorithms are delineated for the computation of square roots and inverse square roots of several relevant Gram matrices. The algorithms we detail rely on properly chosen polynomial expansions of the scalar square root and inverse square root functions and the theory of matrix functions. Tables containing different sets of expansion coefficients are provided along with comparative numerical experiments that evidence the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches. In addition, the use of the proposed techniques as a tool for the recovery of the spectrum of integral operators is illustrated in the case of a spherical geometry for which the analytic spectrum is known.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3568083","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201264,62331016); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:30924010207); Fund Program for the Scientific Activities of Selected Returned Overseas Professionals in Shanxi Province(grant numbers:20240063); Foundation of Anhui Key Laboratory of Industrial Energy-Saving and Safety(grant numbers:KFKT202306); European Innovation Council (EIC) through European Union’s Horizon Europe Research Programme (Project CEREBRO)(grant numbers:101046748); European Union–Next Generation EU within the PNRR Project “Multiscale Modeling and Engineering Applications” of Italian National Center for High-Performance Computing (HPC), Big Data and Quantum Computing (Spoke 6)–PNRR M4C2, Investimento 1.4–Avviso n. 3138 del 16/12/2021–CN00000013 National Centre for HPC, Big Data and Quantum Computing (HPC)(grant numbers:CUP E13C22000990001); Labex CominLabs Excellence Laboratory under the National Research Agency in the “Investing for the Future” Program through French Government (Project “CYCLE”)(grant numbers:ANR-10-LABX-07-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11004486","Gram matrix;matrix function;polynomial expansion;spectral analysis;surface integral equation (SIE)","Integral equations;Sparse matrices;Vectors;Symmetric matrices;Polynomials;Electric fields;Standards;Matrix decomposition;Europe;Electromagnetics","","","","28","CCBY","14 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve a fixed beam direction in such a broad bandwidth, the ratio of the phase difference to the operating frequency of the feeding network is designed to be constant across the frequency range. Compared with fixed feeding networks, the topology is highly flexible, allowing for different output phase differences by simply altering the values of the phase shifters. Variable output phase differences  $\varphi $  can be realized by tuning the frequency-dependent power dividers and the phase shifters. A design method for a frequency-dependent power divider is proposed using the signal synthesis theory for directional couplers. Moreover, a broadband 90° phase shifter is proposed to compensate for the phase offset in the feeding network. An experimental feeding network is designed and fabricated for a broadband antenna array, achieving fixed direction beams in the frequency range of 2–4 GHz.

A clear relationship between these channels would allow ISAC systems to reduce the complexity of channel estimation. This communication introduces a framework for reconstructing communication channels using monostatic sensing channels within an ISAC system. We first geometrically illustrate the synergies and differences between the sensing and communication regions determined by frequency intervals. Subsequently, we construct a communication propagation channel based on the overlap determined by this geometric relationship and a simplified monostatic-to-bistatic equivalence theorem. Finally, we combine multipaths located in the same delay bin to construct channel state information (CSI), taking into account the bandwidth constraint. Channel measurements and ray-tracing (RT) simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework accurately generates communication channels.
