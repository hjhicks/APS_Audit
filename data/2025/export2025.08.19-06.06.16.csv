The design exploits the interaction of duplexed inward- and outward-traveling surface waves (SWs) with an unwinding spiral MTS impedance pattern. The two inward/outward illuminations share a common radiating aperture and are originated by an integrated triaxial-cable feeding. The inward cylindrical wave is launched in a parallel plate waveguide (PPWG) by the external part of the triaxial cable (TC) and then redirected inward by a corner reflector at the aperture rim. Interacting with the anisotropic-modulated impedance boundary condition (IBC), it provides a broadside left-handed circularly polarized (LHCP) beam. On the other hand, the outward SW originates from the center as excited by a monopole connected to the inner conductor of the TC and provides a right-handed circularly polarized (RHCP) broadside radiation. New design formulas are derived for the total efficiency of the two modes. A practical feeding structure is designed and validated, featuring a coplanar-to-triaxial waveguide transition for broadband performance, ensuring a low-profile and simple configuration.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3529257","Italian Ministry of Research within a “Project of Relevant Italian Interest” titled “Metasurface Antennas for Space” and a Doctoral Grant through the Programma Operativo Nazionale Ricerca e Innovazione 2014–2020.; National Operational Programme (NOP) on Research and Innovation 2014-2020, Line IV.4.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10847702","Aperture antennas;dual polarization;leaky wave (LW);metasurface (MTS);triaxial feeding system (TFS)","Modulation;Metasurfaces;Antennas;Impedance;Surface waves;Surface impedance;Polarization;Anisotropic;Antenna feeds;Tensors","","2","","34","CCBY","20 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key innovation is a dual-band reflection-type phase shifter using liquid metal (LM)-enabled shunt switches. A stub-loaded branch-line coupler allows the dual-band operation. The switch is based on the via-pad-slot (VPS) structures, unlike conventional switches, without requiring any bias lines. They are used to alter the path length of the reflected signal from the shorted termination. The use of the LM ensures high isolation switches and phase shifters with a wide phase range. The scanning array also features a wideband 1-to-8 Wilkinson power divider and a  $1\times 8$  dual-band dipole array. The array has the same beam direction in both frequency bands when the phase increment is adjusted. To verify the proposed method, a microstrip VPS switch, a dual-band reflection-type phase shifter, and the whole array have been fabricated and measured. A wide phase range of 360°/720° at 1.75/3.5 GHz has been achieved, while the average insertion losses are 1.4 dB at 1.75 GHz and 2 dB at 3.5 GHz, respectively. The dipole array shows omnidirectional dual-beam scanning along the E-plane at both bands, yielding realized gains of 7.2 and 9.74 dBi, respectively.

Two kinds of different polarized mmWave 45° beam-tilted antennas are first developed using novel approaches, respectively, without the introduction of additional structures. Then, two arrays of the proposed 45° beam-tilted antennas are embedded in an ultrawideband Sub-6 GHz half-mode Vivaldi (HM-Vivaldi) antenna, forming large frequency ratio antenna system. Then, to validate the ability to maintain high isolation between disparate frequency bands while allowing for the seamless incorporation with mmWave active circuits, mmWave front-end active circuits are mounted on the surface of the Vivaldi antenna and further integrated with the corresponding mmWave antennas. Experimental results indicate that the entire antenna system can achieve a measured  $\vert S_{11} \vert \lt -10$  dB impedance bandwidth fully covering 0.6–6 GHz and 24.5–29.5 GHz, respectively. The maximum gain fluctuations of the mmWave antennas in the 45° direction for corresponding polarizations are only 1.88 and 1.64 dB, respectively. It has been confirmed that the existence of active circuits in this design has less impact on the antenna performance and the 3 dB beam scanning ranges exceed 80° for both polarizations at 27 GHz.

The diplexer consists of two identical frequency-selective units integrated symmetrically on the output ports of a T-junction equal-power divider. Each unit consists of a 50- $\Omega $  transmission line equipped with two short-ended stubs loaded with two varactors. By changing the bias voltage applied onto these two varactors, specific frequencies are enabled or disabled to pass through the transmission line, yielding frequency selectivity. Importantly, unlike conventional diplexers, it can also allow these two frequency bands to pass through. Consequently, the simple and unique diplexer topology allows the frequency-selective units to have a low insertion loss, compact size, and two interchangeable operation frequencies by only swapping their bias voltages. The diplexer offers three operation modes, namely, 2.45 GHz at Channel-1 while 5.8 GHz at Channel-2, 5.8 GHz at Channel-1 while 2.45 GHz at Channel-2, and both the channels working simultaneously at 2.45 GHz, 5.8 GHz, or both the frequencies. An antenna pair separated by a metal plate and fed by the diplexer is then proposed to obtain frequency-swappable directional patterns. Measured results on a fabricated prototype illustrate successful operation of the three expected diplexer states, which correspondingly creates diplexed directional or bidirectional radiation patterns of the antenna pair. All these findings demonstrate a unique concept for the realization of dual-band frequency- and pattern-reconfigurable antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3518701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10812795","Compact design;frequency-reconfigurable antennas;frequency-swappable diplexers;pattern-reconfigurable antennas","Antenna radiation patterns;Insertion loss;Antenna feeds;Antennas;Varactors;Switches;Resonant frequency;Power transmission lines;Voltage;Australia","","","","43","IEEE","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the novel idea of “supplementary EMC pair” is first proposed, together with the radiation properties provided by the “TM10–TM01 coupled mode” antenna, aiming to conduct a simplified yet accurate array factor analysis. After the adoption of this creative design approach, for the first time, the CP states over the upper half planes for the two designs are evaluated precisely; hence, the dual- and quad-beam performances can be readily appraised accordingly. Finally, two antenna prototypes are simulated, fabricated, and measured to validate the working principle. For the dual-beam antenna, a compact volume of  $0.035\lambda _{g}^{3}$  is highlighted. Compared to other related designs, this work features the widest 3-dB axial ratio beamwidth (ARBW) of a total 160° coverage in the elevational plane, with an attractive increment of 110° pronounced. As for the proposed quad-beam antenna, the design features the most compact volume of  $0.073\lambda _{g}^{3}$ . Besides, the overall 3-dB ARBW accounting for the four beams has decreased to 88°. In conclusion, with sound agreements between theory and practice, this work stands out prominently for its clear insight to provide the most compact dual- and quad-beam CP antennas with wide and narrow beamwidth characteristics, respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3523630","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB3002700,2023YFB3002704); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2023NSFSC0486); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYTS23145); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10829551","Characteristic mode analysis (CMA);circularly polarized (CP) antenna;dual and quad beams;supplementary equivalent magnetic current (EMC) pair","Antennas;Patch antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays;Sun;Prototypes;Directive antennas;Antenna measurements;Switches;Substrates","","","","45","IEEE","6 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, we demonstrated a new genre of unconventional extreme subwavelength nano-antennas that are several orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength they radiate, and yet they radiate efficiently, beating the conventional Harrington limits on the gain and radiation efficiency by many orders of magnitude. This is made possible by their unique unconventional mechanism of activation. These nano-antennas are implemented with 2-D periodic arrays of ~100-nm-sized nanomagnets deposited on piezoelectric substrates. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate excites resonant spin waves in the nanomagnets at discrete (GHz) frequencies via phonon-magnon coupling, which radiates EM waves very efficiently at those frequencies via magnon-photon coupling. Normally, one would expect such ultrasmall antennas to behave as point sources that radiate isotropically. Surprisingly, they do not because of the intrinsic anisotropy in the nanomagnet array. The radiation patterns in the plane of the nanomagnets and the two transverse planes are anisotropic. By changing the direction of SAW propagation in the plane of the nanomagnets, one can change the radiation patterns in all three planes, which heralds a new method of beam steering or active electronic scanning.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3521581","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2235789); Virginia Commonwealth University Commercialization Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10819362","Active electronically scanned antenna (AESA);beam patterning;extreme subwavelength nano-antennas;phonon-magnon–photon coupling","Surface acoustic waves;Magnetostriction;Substrates;Magnetoacoustic effects;Couplings;Electromagnetic scattering;Frequency measurement;Electromagnetics;Antennas;Antenna theory","","","","30","IEEE","31 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, we propose a feasible structure of parasitic resonator pair. In this case, the common and differential modes (DMs) of the resonator pair are excited simultaneously, with the parasitic common mode (CM) to eliminate the efficiency dip. Inevitably, another efficiency dip appears due to the parasitic DM, but is located out of band without bandwidth deterioration. A prototype is fabricated and tested, showing a CP bandwidth of 3.5% with an extremely low profile of  $0.012~\lambda _{0}$  ( $\lambda _{0}$  is the free-space wavelength at the center frequency).

It is derived that the amplitude and phase of the antenna’s scattering field can be tuned by changing its load impedance. Subsequently, PIN diodes are implemented to control the load impedance. When the PIN diode switches, the antenna’s scattering field meets the condition of equal amplitude and a phase difference of 180°. As a result, the RCS of the antenna array can be controlled. Moreover, by introducing an additional prephase, the inherent symmetric dual-beam issue of 1-bit reconfigurable structures is overcome, achieving single-beam scanning of the scattering field.

The proposed transmit-reflect (TR) aperture consists of a transmission Huygens’ element (TE) and a reflection element (RE) arranged in an alternating configuration, both of which are ultrathin and miniaturized. The TE achieves tri-mode degeneracy by employing two distinct degeneracy approaches, aiming to enable broadband operation in an ultrathin miniaturized state.

In this article, a high-impedance structure is incorporated into the X-band element to eliminate high-order modes and prevent phase differences between TE and TM modes. Additionally, a bandpass FSS is employed to mitigate the influence of the high-frequency (HF) element on the low-frequency (LF) element.

In this article, we consider a 3-D microwave imaging system under the Born approximation employing a uniform circular array (UCA) suitably designed to produce OAM beams with different pure azimuthal orders. The performance of the OAM-based imaging approach is compared to that achieved by exploiting the spatial diversity offered by the individual radiating elements in the UCA, i.e., implementing a multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) approach. To this aim, a fully vector formulation is employed and both point targets as well as extended 3-D perfectly conducting (PEC) and dielectric objects are reconstructed implementing a truncated singular-value-decomposition scheme. Multiple azimuthal orders are considered, generated by circular arrays of dipoles arranged with different orientations. The results of such analysis indicate the feasibility of using the OAM degree of freedom in addition to spatial diversity for 3-D imaging reconstruction. In the circular array systems presented in this work—where the number of radiative elements and the array radius are determined by the geometry of the studied region and the desired azimuthal orders—the two approaches are shown to have comparable performance in most cases, with the OAM system offering significant computational advantages.

In this article, we present an analytical model for the contribution of an isotropic scatterer embedded in an otherwise homogeneous medium to the probe admittance. We utilize rigorous scattering theory and various approximations to obtain simplified, closed-form expressions. Using the obtained results, we present a method to accurately extract the scatterer properties from a measurement of the admittance. In addition, we define the sensing depth and show how it can be mapped as a function of the expected scatterer properties.

Notably, this hybrid method demonstrates robustness in achieving beampattern calculation compared to traditional full-wave analysis methods. Subsequently, the modified excitation factor (MEF) is proposed to compensate the beampattern deterioration caused by coupling. Furthermore, a frequency-dependent tandem architecture is employed to enable real-time beam synthesis for WTCAs.

In particular, herein, we consider two versions of the BF algorithm: the windowed and the nonwindowed schemes. This goal is pursued in the framework of small scatterer imaging, by considering a multiview/multistatic/multifrequency configuration. We succeed in analytically estimating the point-spread functions (PSFs) of the methods under comparison and this allows us to establish a clear connection between the different methods in terms of the achievable resolution and, at the same time, to highlight the link between the configuration parameters and the performance. The role of noise, the cross-terms, the multiple scattering, and the uncertain antenna frequency response are also addressed by a combination of analytical and numerical arguments.

In this article, we present measurement campaigns conducted in a van and a car across below 7 GHz, millimeter-wave (mmWave), and subterahertz (sub-THz) bands. These campaigns aim to compare the channel characteristics for in-vehicle scenarios across various frequency bands. Channel impulse responses (CIRs) were measured at various locations distributed across the engine bay of both the van and the car. The CIR results reveal a high similarity in the delay properties between frequency bands below 7 GHz and mmWave bands for the measurements in the engine bay. Sparse channels can be observed at sub-THz bands in the engine bay scenarios. Channel spatial profiles in the passenger cabin of both the van and the car are obtained by the directional scan sounding (DSS) scheme for three bands. We compare the power-angle delay profiles (PADPs) measured at different frequency bands in two line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios and one non-LOS (NLOS) scenario. Some major multipath components (MPCs) can be identified in all frequency bands and their trajectories are traced based on the geometry of the vehicles.

We then derive a closed-form Fresnel-based uniform asymptotic solution for cases where the beam hits arbitrarily near the edge, thus exciting strong diffraction, shadow, and reflection boundary (RB) effects and possibly surface waves (SWs). The complex argument of the Fresnel functions accounts uniformly for the beam collimation and its displacement from the edge, as well as the observation points’ location with respect to the shadow and reflection transition zones. Similar expressions are derived for the SW fields. The various edge-related phenomena, the effect of losses in the surface impedance, and the beam properties are explored both analytically and numerically.

In this article, a parameter identification method that determines the necessary conditions of observation for obtaining a unique solution in parameter inversion of a general electrically large curved surface is proposed. The method analyzes the relationship between surface geometry and position parameters with observation angles, frequency bands, and polarization modes. It includes two main steps. First, it divides curved surfaces into singly and doubly curved surfaces based on their dispersion effect and concludes that the length of singly curved surfaces can be inverted when frequency points satisfy the Nyquist sampling theorem. Second, it employs algebraic transformations to convert the nonlinear terms into linear expressions for the inversion of other curvature and position parameters. Furthermore, the measurement schemes required to achieve unique solutions for curved surface parameter inversion under typical monostatic and bistatic observation modes are explored. It also investigates the relationship between the robustness of the method and factors such as radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the amount of radar data.

It produces coarse paths that are further refined to exact paths consisting of reflections and diffractions. A commercial RT tool is utilized as the baseline for validating the simulated paths. A significant majority of the baseline paths is found. The robustness to noise is examined by artificially applying noise along the normal vector of each point. It is observed that the proposed method is capable of adapting to noise and finds similar paths compared to the baseline path trajectories with noisy point clouds. This is prevalent especially if the normal vectors of the points are estimated accurately. Finally, a simulation is performed with a reconstructed point cloud and compared against channel measurements and the baseline paths.

The proposed approach leverages on the nonuniqueness of the inverse source (IS) problem associated with the SP-EMS design by decomposing the induced surface current into preimage (PI) and null-space (NS) components. Successively, the unknown EMS layout and NS expansion coefficients are determined by means of an alternate minimization of a suitable cost function. This latter quantifies the mismatch between the ideal surface current, which radiates the user-defined target field, and that actually induced on the EMS layout. Results from a representative set of numerical experiments, concerned with the design of EMSs reflecting pencil-beam as well as contoured target patterns, are reported to assess the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the performance of inexpensive EMS realizations. The measurements on an EMS prototype, featuring a conductive ink pattern printed on a standard paper substrate, are also shown to prove the reliability of the synthesis process.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3529203","Project DICAM-EXC (Departments of Excellence 2023–2027) through Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MUR)(grant numbers:L232/2016); Project “Smart ElectroMagnetic Environment in TrentiNo— SEME@TN” through Autonomous Province of Trento(grant numbers:CUP: C63C22000720003); Project “AURORA—Smart Materials for Ubiquitous Energy Harvesting, Storage, and Delivery in Next Generation Sustainable Environments” through Italian Ministry for Universities and Research within the PRIN-PNRR 2022 Program; Project “ICSC National Center for HPC, Big Data and Quantum Computing (CN HPC),” Project “Telecommunications of the Future (PE00000001—Program “RESTART,” Structural Project 6GWINET), Project INSIDE-NEXT—Indoor Smart Illuminator for Device Energization and Next-Generation Communications, and Project “Telecommunications of the Future (PE00000001—Program RESTART, Focused Project MOSS) through European Union—NextGenerationEU within the PNRR Program(grant numbers:CUP: E63C22000970007,CUP: D43C22003080001,CUP: E53D23000990001,CUP: J33C22002880001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10847756","Inverse scattering;inverse source (IS) formulation;metamaterials;metasurfaces;next-generation communications;nonradiating currents;smart electromagnetic environment (SEME);static passive EM skins","Electromagnetics;Antennas and propagation;Vectors;Surface impedance;Skin;Layout;Costs;Standards;Energy management;Substrates","","1","","32","IEEE","20 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the current TDAs will involve huge interpolation operations and bring redundant computational burden in the processing, which will inevitably degrade the algorithm performance. In this article, a fast subsurface Cartesian factorized back-projection (SCFBP) algorithm is proposed for GPR-SAR imaging, where the sub-image spectrum properties of the layered medium are investigated particularly and a two-step spectrum compression is developed according to the permittivity. As the sub-image spectrums are effectively aligned and compressed, only a very low Nyquist sampling rate (NSR) is required for the noninterpolated sub-image merging process, which will dramatically decrease the computational burden to achieve high performance both in efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, the inaccurate permittivity of the underground medium is particularly considered in GPR-SAR applications. By establishing the mapping relationship between the inaccurate permittivity of the underground medium and the introduced phase error in the imaging process, a fast echo-based compensation is developed with SCFBP, which can effectively eliminate the effects of the inaccurate permittivity on the imaging quality and accurately invert the permittivity of the underground medium for subsequent medium classification and identification. Promising results from both simulation and raw data experiments are presented and analyzed to validate the performance advantages of the proposed algorithm.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3529777","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62061031); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20224ACB202003,20232ACB212003,20244BAB28001); Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20243BBG71030,20244BBG73002); Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and Human-Machine Interaction(grant numbers:2024SSY03121); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing Municipality(grant numbers:CSTB2024NSCQ-MSX1125); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10847708","Ground-penetrating radar (GPR);permittivity inversion;spectrum compression;subsurface Cartesian factorized back-projection (SCFBP);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Permittivity;Imaging;Radar imaging;Synthetic aperture radar;Antennas and propagation;Merging;Classification algorithms;Accuracy;Error analysis;Image coding","","1","","42","IEEE","20 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Also, a low-profile differential V-shaped microstrip patch antenna (DVMPA) is designed as the FTA feed to achieve low cross-polar levels, and symmetrical pattern throughout the frequency range.

ADLs form an anisotropic effective medium, thus enabling a large scanning volume without supporting surface waves. However, the anisotropy increases the cross-polarization (X-pol) of the antenna in the diagonal plane. This problem can be reduced by introducing vertical metal pins in the ADL superstrate to form the pin-patch structure.

However, AoC radiates often inefficiently due to the highly conductive silicon substrate of standard complementary metal-oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) processes. Artificial magnetic conductors (AMCs) embedded within the CMOS stack-up have been shown to enhance the gain by providing in-phase reflection and isolating the AoC from the Si substrate. However, due to the proximity of AoC to the AMC, only the nearby AMC cells get properly illuminated. Thus, the outermost cells do not contribute to the in-phase reflection. Additionally, a typical AMC-backed AoC suffers from narrow bandwidth because of the ultrathin CMOS stack-up. To address these issues, this communication proposes magnetic coupling structures based on metallic patches (H-CES-M), which can not only improve the illumination of the AMC by coupling the energy from well-illuminated unit cells to the outermost unit cells but also enhance the bandwidth by introducing additional resonances. Compared to the conventional AMC, the antenna gain can be improved by 4.5 dB through H-CES-M, and the impedance bandwidth can be enhanced by six times. Finally, the proposed AMC-backed AoC with H-CES-M achieved an impedance bandwidth of 14.8 GHz (an improvement of 12.7 GHz over standard AMC), a boresight gain of 10.4 dBi, a radiation efficiency of 62% at 94 GHz, and 3-dB gain bandwidth of 9.6%.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3515474","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Research Funding (KRF)(grant numbers:ORA-2022-5314); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10806478","Antenna-on-chip (AoC);artificial magnetic conductor (AMC);bandwidth enhancement;effective illumination;gain enhancement;magnetic coupling","Couplings;Silicon;Bandwidth;Lighting;Substrates;Antennas;Magnetic shielding;Magnetic noise;Reflection;Gain","","","","25","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It consists of two sets of orthogonally arranged wideband single-polarized phased arrays (SPPAs). Each SPPA element employs a new height-reduced stepped flaring slot to obtain the required wideband radiation propriety. Compared with the Vivaldi-based phased array, it decreases the array profile while maintaining the characteristics of wideband response and easy computer numerical control (CNC) machining. An extra easy-to-fabricate square wall is loaded around the feeding part (coaxial probe) of each element to achieve wideband impedance matching. After the DPPA formation, the crosstalk of the E-field between the orthogonal polarizations at high frequencies is further suppressed by optimizing the size of the radiating part. This helps to improve the rapid gain drop during beam scanning. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, two prototypes covering 10–30 GHz are fabricated and tested. The radiating and feeding parts of all elements are combined and manufactured in reasonable layers, which avoids the difficulty of assembling individual elements, as encountered in Vivaldi phased arrays.

The method is termed as the amplitude-phase adjustment (APA) method, as it involves the adjustment of the amplitude and phase of each array element. The methods of element division, element equivalent, and element analysis are employed in the treatment of the series-feed microstrip patch antenna. Combining the characteristics of the series structure, the adjustment values of the patch width of each array element and the length of its corresponding transmission line are obtained. After the adjustment is completed, at 77 GHz, the beam squint angle of the linear array radiation pattern has been reduced from −1.60° (based on the traditional method) to −0.01° (based on the APA method).

This work aims to address this gap by proposing a dual-band omnidirectional dipole and a power divider consisting of purely parallel strip lines. A dipole loaded with serpentine lines achieves both excellent matching conditions and omnidirectional radiation at WLAN 2.45-/5.5-GHz bands. A power divider with a modified topology consisting of parallel strip lines does not affect omnidirectionality. Four-unit array consisting of the reported dipole and divider is designed.

Three main issues are mainly addressed, including the array axis-ratio (AR) bandwidth enhancement, the array tilted beam design, and the environment suitability in aerospace. The sequential feeding with a 90° phase shift is preferred in the subarray to improve the 3-dB AR bandwidth (ARBW).

In this communication, a dual-band antenna for metal-bezel smartwatches, which is almost unaffected by the human wrist, is proposed and studied. Unlike traditional smartwatch antenna designs, which directly excite the metal bezel, this work employs a coupled-feeding technique, where the metal bezel is coupled-fed by the coupling metal. The proposed coupled-feeding technique significantly enhances the vertical electric field, making the impact of the wrist on the antenna performance negligible. A prototype demonstrates that, with the coupled-feeding technique, the frequency shift is nearly 0 MHz in the both GPS L1 and Bluetooth (BT) bands. Meanwhile, the efficiency reduction is just 0.3 dB in the GPS L1 band (from −3.8 to −4.1 dB) and 0.2 dB in the BT band (from −3.6 to −3.8 dB). Additionally, with the coupled-feeding technique, the proposed antenna consistently demonstrates stable and reliable performance, whether worn on the left or right wrist or with different coupled-feeding positions. In summary, the proposed antenna, utilizing the coupled-feeding technique, demonstrates slight frequency shift, exceptionally low efficiency degradation, and excellent performance consistency, making it highly promising for practical applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3526897","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101133); Shanghai Rising Star Program(grant numbers:22QC1400100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10839250","Coupled feeding;dual-band antenna;metal bezel;smartwatches;wrist effect","Metals;Antennas;Wrist;Global Positioning System;Capacitors;Inductors;Dual band;Couplings;Degradation;Loading","","","","25","IEEE","13 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ME dipole employs a split-ring-resonator (SRR) structure, which inherently offers a high-band suppression characteristic. When combined with a wideband low-pass filtering bias network, the system achieves exceptional frequency selectivity. A p-i-n diode is strategically positioned at the virtual input port of the filtering network with high isolation between signal and dc bias, achieved through an integrated LC filter. By switching the p-i-n diode, a stable 180° phase difference is achieved across a broad bandwidth. The equivalent 1-bit manipulation, being highly band selective, enables the RRA to demonstrate an outstanding capability of gain-filtering beamforming. To validate the proposed concept, a reflectarray (RA) with  $28\times 32$  cells was fabricated, and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board was used to control the states of each diode. Measurement results show that the RRA achieves a peak gain of 19.7 dBi and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 29.6% from 10.5 to 14.2 GHz, closely aligning with simulation results.
