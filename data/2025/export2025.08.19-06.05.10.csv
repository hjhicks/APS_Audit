In this work, we propose an auxiliary classifier generative method inspired by the auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks (AC-GANs) from the computer vision domain, integrated with an evolutionary strategy to facilitate class-based antenna design. By allocating suitable class labels, multiple design requirements can be efficiently met. This method categorizes antenna designs to enable simultaneous optimization of various antenna types within a unified geometric model. Utilizing a discriminator—generator framework typical of GANs, the discriminator predicts class labels from geometric models, while the generator creates new candidates to satisfy these classifications. An additional filter layer, a random forest (RF) classifier, refines the generator’s outputs, proving effective in our experiments. The incorporation of evolutionary criteria significantly enhances the design process, mirroring active learning principles to address the challenges of limited and expensive datasets. The final outcomes include both optimized geometric designs and a robust generator capable of producing these designs in large quantities.

However, its sensitivity is strongly limited by the noise coming from both classical and quantum levels, and how to enhance it significantly remains challenging. In theory, we aim to optimize the laser array, highlighting the importance of coherence among microwave signals and the uniformity of laser beam power within the array, to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and elevate sensitivity to a new standard. To enhance practical application mobility and integration, we propose two optimization schemes: a six-port fiber-coupled vapor cell probe array and cascaded diffraction gratings. We maintain steady MW signal coherence in the laser array by using identical vapor cells and positioning the probe lasers on the incident wave’s equal phase plane. Our findings reveal that the wavefront phase difference for the six-port fiber-coupled vapor cell array is 10°, while the cascaded diffraction gratings show a 16° difference, with laser intensity uniformity reaching 90.4%. In our experiment, a 4.6-dB SNR enhancement was achieved by utilizing the cascaded diffraction gratings to generate  $2 \times 2$  probe laser arrays compared to the performance of a laser beam, which can be enhanced further just by adding more laser beams. In particular, a  $2 \times 2$  laser array experimental verification yielded  $19~\text {nv/cm}/\sqrt {\textrm {Hz}}$ @8.57 GHz. More importantly, the intermediate signals of the laser array maintain coherence. Therefore, SNR improvement is allowed even in detecting weak target signals amid strong noise and clutter.

The proposed hybrid lens combines a slow-wave lens (a dielectric convex lens) with a fast-wave lens (a metal concave lens), which reduces the lens thickness. Moreover, the proposed lens structure theoretically allows for any positive value of the focal length-to-diameter ratio (F/D), ensuring that the lens can operate under a smaller F/D. By reducing the lens thickness and working with a smaller F/D, the overall length of the high-gain horn antenna is significantly shortened. The working principle and design process are provided. To validate the proposed theory, a lens horn antenna operating in the Ka-band with an F/D of 0.6 and a radiation aperture diameter of 80 mm ( $8\lambda $ @30 GHz) is designed and fabricated. The total length of the antenna is 67 mm ( $6.7\lambda $ @30 GHz).

The proposed array design consists of  $2\times 2$  subarrays, each incorporating diagonal complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs) in a meanderline fashion on the ground plane. These meanderline CSRRs leverage the coupled resonance theory and a novel CSRR feeding technique to enhance decoupling among closely placed array elements at 28.5 GHz and enable a second band of operation at 24.5 GHz. Antenna excitation is achieved through the CSRRs slot instead of traditional via feeding or aperture coupling methods. The meanderline CSRRs serve as both a bandgap structure between antenna elements and a coupling structure between the antenna elements and feedlines. We fabricated and measured both  $2\times 2$  and  $4\times 4$  arrays on a double-layer fused silica substrate, with each layer having a thickness of 0.35 and 0.18 mm, respectively.

This FP cavity includes a 0.9947 reflection coefficient periodic metal slit structure and a reflective plate. In our experiment, 21-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement is achieved by utilizing the FP cavity. Ultimately, the atomic receiver loaded with a FP cavity provides a sensitivity of  $ \mathbf {5 \mathbf {nv/cm/\sqrt {Hz}}}$ @8.57 GHz that is the most advanced sensitivity known based on  $\mathbf {^{133}\textrm {Cs}}$  resonant transition  $\mathbf {|44D_{5/2}\rangle \rightarrow |45P_{3/2}\rangle }$ . Since the FP cavity is different from the traditional closed cavity and split-ring resonance mechanism, a large enhancement tunable frequency bandwidth of 4.8–12.2 GHz can be achieved by adjusting the plate spacing. In addition, the FP cavity solves the direct coupling between the electromagnetic wave and the resonator in the X-band, which provides mobility and flexibility.

The approach involves two portions: multiple modes generation and modes superposition. First, asynchronously coupled patch (ACP) resonators are used to generate two pairs of copolarized odd and even modes, aided by characteristic mode (CM) analysis. Next, A lossy four-coupled resonator circuit is proposed to characterize these ACP resonators, with a mode-multiplexed central load guiding the decoupling process. The process reallocates the eigenfrequencies of two even modes while fixing odd modes. Building upon this, the input conductance of both odd and even modes is adjusted to align with the port conductance, ensuring wideband decoupling under optimal impedance matching. The proposed decoupling method is validated through the design and experimental testing of two antenna pairs and a 1-by-4 array. Antenna pairs demonstrate over 25 dB port isolation across bands of 3.44–4.57 GHz (28.2%) and 3.58–4.71 GHz (27.3%).

As an illustrative example, a bistatic IBFD array consisting of two transmitting antennas and two receiving antennas working in the 5G-N41 band is designed, where the space coupling wave between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) is regulated by the IS for neutralizing coupling signals from other paths. With the help of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and measured data of the prototype, a surrogate model expressing the mapping between the phase distribution of the IS elements and corresponding Tx-Rx transmission coefficients (TRTC) is learned and called repeatedly in the subsequent genetic algorithm-based optimization.

However, the optimal method for pre-phasing using random phases has yet to be fully explored. This study investigates the optimal number of pre-phasing, which denotes the minimum number of discrete random phases for effective suppression of QLs and side lobes while ensuring low design complexity. The results indicate that employing four discrete phases, equally spaced at 45° intervals, is the optimal solution for both normal and oblique incidences. The random phases with a 45° separation are implemented into four pairs of unit cells with passive on/off switching using multilayer PCBs at 140 GHz. Each unit cell consisted of a metallic patch coupled to a transmission (Tx) line through a slot, with embedded static on/off switching in the Tx line to enable 1-bit reflection phase control. Finally, three MSs with  $30\times 30$  unit cells, each with fixed random pre-phases, are designed and fabricated to reflect normal incidence at reflection angles ( $\theta _{r}$ ) of 15°, 30°, and 45° at 140 GHz. The experiment results demonstrate peak reflected beams at 15°, 29°, and 45° with frequencies of 139.7, 139.1, and 135.9 GHz, respectively.

Furthermore, the harmonic phenomena based on time-modulated metasurfaces (TMMs) have received much attention in communication and radar detection applications, which can reduce the efficiency of radar target detection. However, the existing research on time-varying metasurface has neglected its potential to manipulate the scattering characteristics of polarized radar targets. When a linear polarization wave is incident on a metasurface, it will be reflected into two orthogonal polarization states of EM waves, thus directly affecting the polarized scattering of the target. Active polarization conversion metasurfaces (APCMs) can manipulate the polarization of EM waves, aligning well with polarimetric radar. In this work, a dual-polarization radar target feature manipulation (Pol-TFM) method based on APCM is proposed, which enables manipulation of the harmonic and energy distribution of radar echo signals in multiple polarization channels. Through this processing, virtual targets generated by harmonic effects become observable on the dual-polarized high-resolution range profile (HRRP). This method also allows for the position manipulation of the virtual targets. Finally, echo signal experiments are conducted in dual-polarimetric channels to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3526901","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371455); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10839289","Active polarization conversion metasurface (APCM);high-resolution range profile (HRRP);polarimetric radar;spectrum conversion;time-modulated metasurfaces (TMMs)","Metasurfaces;Radar;Harmonic analysis;Radar polarimetry;Radar imaging;Encoding;Radar antennas;Jamming;Frequency modulation;Radar cross-sections","","13","","45","IEEE","13 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, in a joint direction of arrival (DoA) and polarization estimation, the receiving antenna polarization in the maximum gain direction is usually equated to the one from any incoming wave direction, leading to unacceptable estimation errors. To this end, a direction-finding model is proposed in this article, which makes use of arbitrarily polarized antennas to explore spatial polarization characteristics. Specifically, the relationship between the co-polarization of a transmitting and receiving antenna and the polarization of radiated electromagnetic waves is derived from a unified Cartesian coordinate system. Subsequently, a definition of quantification for antenna polarization is proposed, which can represent the polarization in direction-finding solutions more naturally and intuitively. In consideration of rotation and spatial polarization characteristics of the receiving antenna, the proposed direction-finding model is thus developed with a unified polarization representation.

The WFC located at the near-field region of a microstrip patch antenna, composed of two dielectric substrates sandwiched by three layers of circular ring resonators or their complementary patterns, can effectively concentrate additional radiation energy of the antenna toward the main lobe direction by converting spherical waves to plane waves in the near-field region, thereby enhancing radiation gain and directionality in the far-field region. At the same time, when encountering an incidence plane wave externally for investigating the scattering properties of the considered antenna, the WFC will transform the reflected plane wave into a quasi-ellipsoidal wave, which can achieve a monostatic radar cross-sectional (RCS) reduction in the far-field region by dispersing the scattering energy in all directions. The mechanisms of synchronous modulation of radiation and scattering characteristics are studied by the principle analysis and experimental verification. Numerical and experimental results show that the reference antenna’s gain has been enhanced by 15.7 dBi, while its in-band monostatic RCS has been reduced by more than 10 dB.

First, in our new sparse regularization, we assign different LPWs to scattering centers based on their frequency dependence factors (FDFs). These LPWs can provide different regularization strengths regarding FDFs, which improve the accuracy of BWE. Then, we propose an unrolling algorithm named fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA)-LPW, to optimize these LPWs through supervised learning. We utilize the full band spectrums as training labels, to reduce extrapolation error in a data-driven manner. We analyze the advantage of our sparse regularization with LPWs and show that it can address the issue of degraded extrapolation accuracy in the cases of limited observation bandwidth.

In this study, the shadowing loss characteristics due to the human body was investigated by measuring the propagation loss and direction of arrival (DOA) of diffraction waves when a human body phantom blocks the line-of-sight (LOS) propagation path. The DOAs and the shadowing losses were measured by a terahertz hemispheric scanner and vector network analyzer (VNA). For a human body phantom positioned upright with a gap between the arms and torso, the removal of the arms increased the shadowing loss by more than 10 dB. DOA measurements revealed a reduction in the shadowing loss upon attachment of the arms, attributed to the additional propagation path created by diffraction inside the arms. The shadowing loss for a human body with arms could be estimated using a model comprising a double-isolated-knife-edge diffraction (DIKED) model for the torso and a single-knife-edge diffraction (SKED) model for the arm when a gap exists between the torso and arms. By comparing with actual measurement values, we demonstrated that this method can estimate the diffraction at the head and torso. When the phantom without arms was dressed in a down coat, the shadowing loss decreased by approximately 9 dB because the scattering induced by the down coat broadened the DOA of the received radio wave diffracted at the side of the torso. When the phantom’s head was covered with a wig, the shadowing loss at the head reduced by approximately 2.8 dB due to scattering by the wig. These results indicate that arms, hair, and clothing have a significant impact on shadowing loss by the human body at 300 GHz. The human body shadowing (HBS) loss was successfully calculated using the DIKED model with the effects of arms, hair, and clothing added as correction terms.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3520664","National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Japan, through the Commissioned Research(grant numbers:00401); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817494","6G mobile communication;body area network;direction of arrival (DOA);knife-edge diffraction (KED) model;shadowing loss;submillimeter-wave propagation;terahertz communications","Loss measurement;Shadow mapping;Antenna measurements;Phantoms;Torso;Diffraction;Clothing;Propagation losses;Permittivity measurement;Receiving antennas","","","","24","IEEE","27 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The potential for effective imaging with DBIM has been demonstrated for a variety of applications. However, it is more challenging to reliably produce high-fidelity imagery when the aperture formed by the sensors does not fully surround the region of interest and when data is collected over a narrow bandwidth. To address this challenge, we propose a beamforming enhancement to DBIM for limited-aperture scenarios. The beamforming enhancement pre-focuses the data prior to performing the DBIM optimization in order to achieve a better-conditioned inversion. The enhancement is an advance on previous beamforming work for DBIM in that it focuses simultaneously across not only space but also frequency, which allows for better leveraging of range information in the limited-aperture signal. Results for simulated and experimental data demonstrate that the frequency beamforming enhancement to DBIM results in less sensitivity to the choice of the regularization parameter and produces better reconstructions when spatial and frequency information is limited.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3526904","Office of Naval Research via the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) 6.2 Base Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10839264","Electromagnetic propagation;inverse problems;radar theory;signal processing","Image reconstruction;Array signal processing;Imaging;Apertures;Iterative methods;Dielectrics;Scattering;Electric fields;Radar;Approximation methods","","2","","42","USGov","13 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, two air rings are introduced at the edge of the cylindrical DRA for the bandwidth enhancement of two HEM ports, while a cylindrical air region is introduced at the bottom center of the DRA for enhancing the bandwidth of the TM port. With an appropriate aspect ratio of the DRA selected, it was also found that each port exhibited mode merging, thus effectively expanding the bandwidth.

Meanwhile, a sequential rotation feeding network (SRFN) is adopted for the Ka-band antenna to improve the axial ratio (AR) performance. The measured results show that the overlapped operational bands ( $\vert $ S $_{\mathbf {11}} \vert \lt -10$  dB and AR <3 dB) are 11.4% (6.2–6.95 GHz) for the C-band and 36.7% (26–37.7 GHz) for the Ka-band, with realized peak gains of 9.36 and 17.2 dBic, respectively. The isolations of the shared aperture antenna within the two operating bandwidths are both better than 20 dB. With the excellent advantages of low profile and dual wideband, the proposed antenna is suitable for various communication applications in CubeSats.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3467677","University of Technology Sydney ARC Future Fellow Near Miss Support Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10702497","Circularly polarized (CP);CubeSat;low profile;magnetoelectric (ME) dipole antenna;shared aperture","Antenna arrays;Antennas;CubeSat;Dipole antennas;C-band;Substrates;Aperture antennas;Microstrip antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Gain","","2","","32","IEEE","1 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address the limitations of mechanical beam-scanning metasurfaces, a novel high-frequency design approach is proposed, which incorporates hybrid unit cells exhibiting high transmission amplitude and a 60° phase difference across the broadband range. By integrating a combination of identical and nonidentical unit cells, the proposed design enables the realization of arbitrary transmission phase ranges with reduced design complexity. Furthermore, an analysis of the metal layer structure reveals that the introduction of additional resonance variables enhances phase difference stability in the broadband range. A PSS-based broadband mechanical scanning scheme is first proposed in the W-band, which is easy to integrate and has low processing costs.

In this work, a novel type of dual-polarized UWB leading edge conformal tightly coupled dipole array (LEC-TCDA) with low-scattering characteristics is proposed for the wings of aircraft platforms. Based on the scattering-matrix approach, a rapid design process for transforming planar TCDA elements into conformal counterparts is proposed, effectively compensating the reduction in gain caused by the curvature of the radiation aperture. Moreover, to reduce the RCS of the antenna, a broadband flexible resistive indium tin oxide (ITO) absorber based on a deformed octagonal ring is designed and employed as a cover layer for controlling the higher frequency out-of-band RCS. A  $10\times 1$  array prototype is fabricated with the standard PCB technology, resin 3-D printing technology, and metal 3-D printing technology. Measurement results show that the proposed array achieves a 0.5–2-GHz (4:1) impedance bandwidth while scanning up to ±45° in the horizontal plane for both polarizations. Remarkably, a measured average RCS reduction (RCSR) of 41.72 and 35.12 dB for H/V-polarization incidence throughout 6–18 GHz is observed.

Integral equations relating the unknown electric and magnetic currents on each particle surface or interface are established individually. Coupling scattering between particles is fully considered by expanding equivalent currents into plane waves on Ewald spheres and translating between particles. Key aspects of the proposed method include establishing linear system matrices for each particle to reduce memory usage and computation time compared with treating the entire cluster as one object. In addition, only adjacent surfaces within each particle are iterated to construct the linear systems rather than all surface combinations across the cluster. Numerical examples demonstrate the method’s accuracy for clusters with different particle shapes, orientations, and core-shell layering.
