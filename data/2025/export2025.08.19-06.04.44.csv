The guided wave excites the metamaterial elements, coupling energy from the waveguide mode to radiation. Under appropriate conditions, each subwavelength metamaterial element can be modeled as a polarizable dipole, with the polarizability determined by an extraction procedure from the computed or measured waveguide scattering parameters. Here, we establish the equivalence of this polarizability description of a metamaterial element with an equivalent circuit model, providing an additional tool for metasurface design that offers significant insight and a path toward efficiently modeling very large apertures. With this equivalence established, more complicated external circuits that include lumped elements and devices such as diodes and transistors can be integrated into the metamaterial element, which can then be transformed into equivalent polarizability for modeling in the coupled dipole framework. We derive appropriate circuit models for several basic metamaterial elements, which provide direct relationships between the equivalent circuit parameters of an element and its effective polarizability. These expressions are confirmed using scattering parameters for several example structures obtained via full-wave simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3439728","Kymeta Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10637920","Antennas;metamaterials;metasurfaces;patch antennas;slot antennas","Metamaterials;Integrated circuit modeling;Apertures;Numerical models;Mathematical models;Waveguide components;Metasurfaces","","2","","28","IEEE","15 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The formulation is rigorously established using the conservation of momentum applied to an offset focal point for the extreme beam generation. Assisted by the above analysis, a new lens design approach for GRIN profile synthesis is proposed with two extreme focal points and then extended to determine a convenient locus of feed that allows for covering the scanning range with minimal overall aperture phase errors. The ray-path errors have been tested and compared with those of previously reported multibeam GRIN lenses, which were based on a straight, parallel ray-path assumption inside the lens. The superiority and generality of the new design formulas have been proven by comparing lens prototypes from the two different methods. It is demonstrated that the proposed one can enable consistent gain enhancement for multiple beams at different operating frequencies. Finally, the new design method has been validated by implementing an all-dielectric 3-D-printed seven-beam flat GRIN lens.

It hybridizes reconfigurable folded reflectarray (RFRA) and reconfigurable folded transmitarray (RFTA) simultaneously. By employing two pairs of 1-bit reconfigurable unit cells of (0°, 180°) and (90°, 270°), the hybrid antenna achieves 2-bit phase resolution. More importantly, the hybrid structure alleviates the design burden on the bias network, because only half of the unit cells are necessary to be reconfigurable, while the other half are fixed. Meanwhile, the reconfigurable unit cells are dispersed on both of the top and bottom metasurface. To validate the hybrid idea, two prototypes operating at a center frequency of 26 GHz are analyzed and measured, in which the metal stub/open circuit is used to model the “on/off” state of p-i-n diode for simplification. The prototypes can achieve beam switching among four fixed beams and OAM mode switching among four OAM modes. In addition, compared with 1-bit RFRA or RFTA, the proposed prototype for beam switching achieves a much wider 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 27.1% and a higher aperture efficiency of 18.1%. Meanwhile, the other prototype achieves higher order OAM mode switching between  ${l} =-3$  and  ${l} =1$ .

In modern systems where antennas and beamforming networks are integrated into a single package, OTA measurements are often the only viable option as traditional methods of characterizing the radio frequency (RF) signal separately are not feasible. In this article, we introduce an innovative near-field (NF) measurement technique that solves multiple challenges of state-of-the-art OTA measurement systems. In particular, our system is very compact, fast, and reproducible as it does not involve any relative movement of the antenna under test (AUT) or the probe antennae, making it cost-effective especially in large-scale characterization and production test scenarios. We discuss the theory and algorithm, which yields the same quantities we could get from state-of-the-art measurement systems, the design of the NF probing system, and show results from a proof-of-concept implementation that prove the possibility of reconstructing far-field (FF) antenna patterns from NF measurements under various conditions.

In this article, a multiport network model is established to represent the resistive loading antenna. Based on the generalized S parameters defined by power waves, concise and accurate expressions for calculating radiation efficiency (RE) and power absorption ratio (PAR) are derived and verified by simulation. After that, an HAA with no feedlines is presented with a detailed explanation of resistor loading positions. The resistance values are determined in a simple and fast manner without the need for multiple full-wave simulations. The measured results of the final prototype verify the absorption capacity for up to  $4f_{0}$  (operating frequency).

This approach integrates a broadband, petal-shaped cross dipole with a 3-D-printed structure comprising multilayers of high-permittivity material with varying heights and radii. In the absence of a theoretical model and a satisfactory initial design, the design process employs the enhanced tree-structured Parzen estimator Bayesian optimization (TPE-BO) algorithm, a significant advancement over traditional Bayesian methods, for effective hyperparameter tuning to streamline the design. The proposed method only adjusts the high dielectric constant loading (HDL) structure without changing the original dimensions of the dipole. Compared with conventional optimization algorithms integrated within CST, this method efficiently achieves the desired broadband and low-profile performance. Meanwhile, the mechanism of the HDL structure in increasing the bandwidth (BW) while enabling the dipole’s low-profile performance is explained. The proposed approach has been validated by fabricating and measuring a hybrid antenna prototype. The measured results show that the antenna achieves an overlap BW between the impedance matching BW and the 3-dB gain BW of 79.3% (from 1.62 to 3.75 GHz) with a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of less than 1.6. In addition, the isolation between the two ports exceeds 20.5 dB. Significantly, this HDL technique notably enhances the BW and reduces the antenna’s profile from  $0.2\lambda _{L}$  to  $0.1\lambda _{L}$  compared with a single-petal-shaped cross dipole.

The antenna is composed of a double-layer composite single-sided (DL-CSS) SSPP transmission line (TL) and asymmetric radiation patches. The DL-CSS SSPP element has stronger dispersion characteristics and well-separated dispersion curves, facilitating designing the frequency-scanning antenna with dual-beam, ultrawide angle, and high scanning rate. The asymmetric radiation patches consist of an elliptic patch array and a rectangular patch array with different modulation periods, effectively improving the open-stopband effect through beam synthesis. Simulation and measurement results show that the dual-beam frequency-scanning antenna can realize 360° full coverage scanning in the whole space without a dead angle. The operating frequency band is 6.79–8.69 GHz, the relative bandwidth is 24.5%, and the scanning rate is 7.35°/%. The average gain is 9.98 dBi and the maximum gain is 12.38 dBi. Furthermore, the overall radiation efficiency is more than 50%, and the average radiation efficiency is 68.99%. Thus, the designed antenna not only greatly broadens the scanning range and raises the scanning rate but also improves the open-stopband effect of broadside radiation.

In this article, we investigate the design of an unimodular transmit sequence that is robust against steering vector mismatches, with the aim of enhancing the performance of a frequency diverse array multiple-input-multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) radar system in the presence of signal-dependent main-lobe interference. The design is formulated as a max-min problem, constrained by the constant modulus of the transmit waveform, and seeks to maximize the worst case output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) over the mismatched target steering vector. As the resulting problem is NP-hard, an iterative approximate scheme is proposed to allow for a feasible solution. Specifically, in each iteration, the inner optimization problem, which solves the norm-constrained steering vector mismatch, is addressed using a 1-D search. Subsequently, the unimodular transmit sequence is designed via two distinct algorithms, namely, the CC-SDR (Charnes-Cooper transformation combined with semidefinite relaxation technique) and CD-DIN (Dinkelbach’s procedure embedded in a coordinated decent framework) algorithms.

It is no wonder, given the increased prevalence of applications such as electronically steered radar, terrestrial multiuser communications (e.g., 5G mobile communications), and space-based shaped beam antennas, among many others. A key figure of merit in the design of a phased array is the directivity pattern, meaning both the peak achievable directivity ( ${D} {_{{0}}}$ ) of the array as well as the peak sidelobe level (PSLL) below the main beam. Especially in the case of large element-count aperiodic arrays, these values are quite difficult to accurately determine without first performing computationally intensive numerical integrations of unpredictable radiation patterns. The literature offers several solutions to determine directivity using analytical (i.e., closed form or exact) array factor (AF) methods, but these leave much to be desired in terms of true generality. In this work, we present a new fully generalized analytical directivity solution that may be applied to planar arrays of totally arbitrary topology. The proposed element model is shown to apply to a variety of practical antennas, in addition to enabling rapid array synthesis. Moreover, the solution is shown to be in excellent agreement with prior solutions when considered as special cases (SCs).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3473026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10713068","Analytical;directivity;element pattern;phased array","Phased arrays;Antennas and propagation;Antenna radiation patterns;Topology;Finite element analysis;Lattices;Tuning;Planar arrays;Costs;Apertures","","1","","43","IEEE","9 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, we further introduce a set of parasitic patches between two adjacent radiated elements to broaden the operating bandwidth (BW) of the antenna, which is demonstrated by both simulation and experiment. Furthermore, based on such an array structure, one deep learning-enabled optimization scheme is developed instead of the traditional full-wave electromagnetic (EM)-based optimization procedure, realizing fast design of a larger array scale with low time cost.

The antenna scattering-reduction unit is a frequency-selective absorber-polarization converter (FSAPC) unit comprising a resistive metasurface (RM) unit, four frequency-selective surface (FSS) units, and four polarization-conversion metasurface (PCM) units arranged in cascade. The RM employs a parallel resonant structure comprising metal rings and parallel lines to create an in-band transmission window for the radiation while simultaneously absorbing the out-of-band electromagnetic waves. The modified PCM configuration is arranged in a diagonal configuration with cutting round arcs and serves two distinct functions. Primarily, it converts the co-polarized component of in-band incidence into a cross-polarized one. Second, the decomposition of the electric field enables the metal square to facilitate the conversion of the antenna-radiated wave from linear to circular polarization. Furthermore, the implementation of a counterclockwise feeding network is expected to enhance the circular-polarization performance. To verify the functional properties of the FSAPC structure, the properties of the constituent units and the FSAPC unit are elucidated and investigated in two dimensions: field and circuit, which are done based on the principles of double-port equivalent circuit and coupler theory. Furthermore, the slot antenna array is directly integrated with the metal reflector of the FSAPC in a chessboard configuration, thereby enabling the realization of the desired radiation performance. The simulation and measurement results demonstrate that the FSAPC-based antenna array is capable of achieving good left-handed CP radiation characteristics and also adept at reducing the RCS by over 10 dB across the 5.73–17.5-GHz range.

This article introduces the concept of an unconventional array-of-array (AoA) architecture, which addresses these challenges by employing a sparsely excited array topology. The AoA architecture classifies antenna elements into different categories, including active elements, inactive elements, and displaced elements. The active elements are clustered by the 1-to-2 power dividers. Then, the array is divided into multiple super subarrays to maintain the realizability of the phased array at the E-band. After that, the array topology is optimized by the null-pull array partition strategy, which considers the impact of the radiation characteristics of antenna elements, subarrays, and super subarrays on the array partition. Based on these methods, the proposed architecture can ensure the wide-scanning ability of ±60° in the horizontal plane and ±30° in the vertical plane by the amplitude-phase synthesis. Next, the wideband magnetoelectric (ME) dipole with the slot-coupled feedline is designed as the antenna element, which operates from 66 to 76 GHz.

In this method, two phase-only metasurface plates are cascaded and coordinated to achieve amplitude modulation and phase alignment. The first phase-only metasurface plate is employed to realize the Chebyshev amplitude distribution of low sidelobes over the aperture of the second phase-only metasurface plate, where the aperture field phase can be subsequently aligned. The phase-only metasurface-based aperture amplitude modulation can effectively avoid energy loss, and it can simultaneously enhance the spillover efficiency to compensate for taper efficiency loss resulting from sidelobe suppression, thereby achieving low sidelobes while avoiding the loss of AE. Besides, to facilitate the specific design of Chebyshev distribution through phase modulation, a fast and efficient method is developed. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two TAs (termed TA1 and TA2, respectively) are designed, fabricated, measured, and compared. TA1 is a TA with optimal AE, and TA2 is designed based on the proposed method of low sidelobes without the loss of AE. Finally, TA2 achieves SLL of −27.2 dB (7.8 dB lower than TA1), a gain of 25.48 dB, and AE of 49.18% (0.26 dB and 3% lower than TA1, respectively).

A general method for designing this unit cell is presented that can be adapted for use with different antenna types and reflecting circuit designs according to the user’s requirements. The unit cell used to verify this approach consists of an E-shaped patch located above a ground plane and a reflecting circuit located underneath it. The reflecting circuit uses three p-i-n diodes to provide four phase shift states. Each unit cell uses three dc bias lines to switch the p-i-n diodes on and off. The p-i-n diodes are the only lumped element components used in each unit cell, which reduces the design and assembly complexity when constructing large-scale reflectarrays. Simulation results demonstrate that the unit cells can achieve less than 2.2-dB loss and a phase error under 35° in the frequency range of 5.6–6.2 GHz.

The emergence of point cloud data offers a potential solution to this issue. However, the lack of EM simulation algorithms optimized for point-based models remains a significant limitation. In this study, we propose PointEMRay, an innovative shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) framework designed explicitly for point-based geometries. To enable SBR on point clouds, we address two critical challenges: point-ray intersection (PRI) and multiple bounce computation (MBC). For PRI, we propose a screen-based method leveraging deep learning. Initially, we obtain coarse depth maps through ray tube tracing, which are then transformed by a neural network into dense depth maps, normal maps, and intersection masks, collectively referred to as geometric frame buffers (GFBs). For MBC, inspired by simultaneous localization and mapping techniques, we introduce a GFB-assisted approach. This involves aggregating GFBs from various observation angles and integrating them to recover the complete geometry. Subsequently, a ray tracing algorithm is applied to these GFBs to compute the scattering EM field. Numerical results and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of PointEMRay in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, including support for real-time simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to develop an SBR framework specifically tailored for point-based models.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3502912","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62301146,62288101); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB3811501); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20230816); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation through the Institute of Electromagnetic Space and the State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave of Southeast University(grant numbers:2023M730554,BX20220065); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10768950","Deep learning;multiple bounce computation (MBC);point-ray intersection (PRI);point cloud;shooting and bouncing ray (SBR)","Point cloud compression;Reflection;Geometry;Ray tracing;Computational modeling;Accuracy;Vectors;Three-dimensional displays;Electromagnetics;Surface waves","","","","54","IEEE","26 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since there are only a few local minimums, some existing algorithms without considering this feature need a lot of useless EM simulations, leading to poor optimization efficiencies. In this article, a hybrid self-adaptive differential evolution (SADE) algorithm with a simplified Bayesian local optimizer (SBLO) (SADE-SBLO) is proposed for improving antenna optimization efficiencies, in which the SADE is used to generate the offspring population. The algorithm also consists of the following four modification strategies: 1) an individual parallel prediction method for reducing surrogate model training (SMT) and prediction times; 2) an offspring quality pre-assessment method for improving offspring quality and further reducing the number of EM simulations; 3) a self-adaptive database increment method for adapting the algorithm to different optimization stages and also serving as a start-up switch for the local optimizer; and 4) an SBLO for improving optimization efficiency in the later stage. These strategies are closely integrated to make the algorithm better balance exploration and exploitation, reduce useless EM simulations, and converge faster. Four representative antenna cases are optimized. Compared with some existing algorithms such as DE and the surrogate model-assisted differential evolution algorithm (SADEA), the proposed algorithm is efficient.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3501406","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62301379); Sichuan Province Engineering Research Center for Broadband Microwave Circuit High Density Integration(grant numbers:BMERC004-2023-06); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767166","Antenna optimization;Bayesian optimization (BO);differential evolution (DE) algorithm;Gaussian process (GP);local optimization","Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Antennas;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Bayes methods;Training;Databases;Adaptation models;Switches","","4","","33","IEEE","25 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To ensure that ray tracer simulations faithfully reproduce wireless channels, calibration of simulation results against real-world measurements is required. In this study, we introduce NYURay, a 3-D ray tracer specifically tailored for mmWave and sub-THz frequencies. To reliably generate site-specific wireless channel parameters, NYURay is calibrated using radio propagation measurements conducted at 28, 73, and 142 GHz in diverse scenarios such as outdoor areas, indoor offices, and factories. Traditional ray tracing calibration assumes angle-dependent reflection, requiring slow iterative optimization techniques with no closed-form solution. We propose a simpler and quicker novel calibration method that assumes angle-independent reflection. The effectiveness of the proposed calibration approach is demonstrated using NYURay. When comparing the directional multipath power predicted by NYURay to the actual measured power, the standard deviation in error was less than 3 dB in indoor office environments and less than 2 dB in outdoor and factory environments. The root mean square (rms) delay spread and angular spread were underpredicted by NYURay due to incomplete environmental maps available for calibration; however, an overall agreement between the measured and simulated values was observed. These results highlight the high level of accuracy NYURay provides in generating the site-specific real-world wireless channel, that could be used to generate synthetic data for machine learning.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3472214","New York University (NYU) Wireless Industrial Affiliates Program; National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:1909206,2037845); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10721240","5G;6G;channel modeling;machine learning;mmWave;sub-THz;wireless ray tracing","Wireless communication;Ray tracing;Reflection;Wireless sensor networks;Calibration;Time measurement;Millimeter wave communication;Loss measurement;Delays;Production facilities","","3","","69","CCBY","17 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a reflection-type broadband amplitude-phase metasurface to generate broadband and crosstalk-free multimode vortex beams, which have also been theoretically verified. Specifically, the dipole-loaded quasi-I-shaped meta-atoms are applied to achieve broadband-independent controls of reflection amplitudes within a range of [0, 0.95] and a 360° phase coverage from 8.6 to 17.8 GHz. Inspired by the amplitude-modulated (AM) technology in the time domain, we mainly investigate the AM vortex beams in the space domain, which belong to multimode vortex beams that have spatially varying amplitude along the azimuth. Finally, two broadband amplitude-phase metasurfaces are devised to generate crosstalk-free AM vortex beams in both simulation and experiment. Those AM vortex beams have spatially tailored amplitude and phase patterns, which can promote the development of multimode communication and other beam-control applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3486918","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB3002700,2023YFB3002704); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2023NSFSC0486); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62231007); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:202206070072); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10741202","Amplitude-modulated (AM) vortex;broadband;crosstalk-free;metasurface;orbital angular momentum (OAM)","Broadband communication;Broadband antennas;Metasurfaces;Acoustic beams;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Crosstalk;Phase control;Bandwidth;Antennas and propagation;Sun","","3","","53","IEEE","1 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important prerequisite for most of the effective utilizations boils down to the precise and expeditious determination of far-field. However, the existence of one-to-many mapping between the far-field space and the metasurface space renders the inverse-design neural network hard to converge and ill-posed, especially in the case of phaseless far-field. In the work, we introduce an invertible neural network (INN)-based generation-elimination (G-E) framework. By introducing extra trainable latent variables in inverse training, the model can largely mitigate the impact by the phaseless far-field, which is the chief culprit of the one-to-many issue. The INN also provides a powerful stochastically generative capability based on trained latent space. An elimination network is cascaded to INN, where groups of nominated patterns from INN will be screen and eliminate the inferior metasurface patterns. Both simulated and experimental results demonstrate that the far-field match degrees are improved by up to 50%, compared with the case of general deep neural network (DNN), meanwhile retaining a competitive process cycle within 1 ms.

In addition, navigating through islands leads to a significant increase in the number of multipath components (MPCs). The single-frequency bias displayed in the Doppler spectrum can provide an insightful dimension for clustering. For large-scale fading, a two-ray model is used to characterize path loss which captures deep fading phenomenon specific to maritime environments. For small-scale fading, we develop a clustered delay line model that shows a linear relationship between cluster delay and TX-RX distance, with excess delay of MPCs following an exponential distribution. Our analysis reveals that the best-fit distribution for small-scale fading in line-of-sight (LOS) conditions shifts from Ricean to log-normal as the ship passes through islands. Furthermore, the number and power of clusters/MPCs are modeled. This research offers valuable insights for the design of maritime communication systems, particularly in environments with islands.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3489880","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61931020); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2022JJ30047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10747178","Channel characteristics;channel model;clustered delay line;maritime communication;microwave propagation","Delays;Sea measurements;Wireless communication;Antenna measurements;Marine vehicles;Fading channels;Channel models;Meters;Maritime communications;Sea surface","","","","46","IEEE","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, owing to the significant differences in channel characteristics between lower bands (<100 GHz) and subterahertz (sub-THz) band (i.e., 100–300 GHz), novel waveform and air interface design for sub-THz systems need to account for the radio channels observed by practical beam patterns. In this article, we investigate the beamforming impact on the characterization of angular and time dispersion based on extensive measured channel data at 142 GHz across multiple scenarios. A postprocessing method for analysis of beamforming impact on channel dispersion is proposed using measured propagation channel data. Since sub-THz radio links necessitate high antenna gains, we first find the potential beam directions from beamformed channels and then form single-beam and multibeam patterns toward desired directions under practical constraints. The angular spread of the beamformed channels observed by steered beams will be widened especially in line-of-sight scenarios. The beam-weighted radio channel is considered the basis of calculating time dispersion parameters, i.e., beam gains are multiplied by the measured propagation path gains before the analysis. Preliminary results show that the reduction of delay spread and maximum excess delay depends mainly on scenario, link distance, and used beamwidth, and partly on sidelobe level.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3489959","Hexa-X-II Project through the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU), European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:101095759); Research Council of Finland (former Academy of Finland) Multipath Project(grant numbers:348980); 6G Flagship Programme(grant numbers:346208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10747176","Angular dispersion;beamforming;radio channel characterization;sub-terahertz (sub-THz);time dispersion","Antenna measurements;Dispersion;Array signal processing;Antenna arrays;Directive antennas;Delays;Antenna radiation patterns;Time measurement;Weight measurement;Horn antennas","","","","28","CCBY","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To enhance the resolutions of 2-D images, sparse signal-processing techniques, such as compressed sensing (CS), have been applied to ISAR imaging using a sparse prior. Despite its efficiency in super-resolution imaging, the performance of CS is constrained due to the mismatch of the discrete dictionary, such as the Fourier transform. To address this issue, we propose a novel off-the-grid super-resolution ISAR imaging algorithm that employs a structured low-rank approach to effectively extrapolate the data bandwidth and aperture. To fully capture the low-rank property of ISAR data, the structured data model is constructed and its low-rank property is deduced to exhibit that the signal is embedded in a limited dimensional subspace. Then, the annihilating filter is derived by constructing a structured data matrix to formulate the proposed structured low-rank method, termed as off-the-grid super-resolution using annihilation constraint (OSAC). Taking into account that super-resolution imaging is highly reliant on the accuracy of the annihilating filter, the optimal annihilating filter is also estimated with the updating of extrapolated ISAR data. Through iterative updates of the annihilating filter and solution of the minimization problem, super-resolution ISAR imaging can be achieved by avoiding the discrete mismatch of the conventional CS method. Due to the effective exploration of structured low-rank property, the proposed OSAC algorithm offers superior precision in scatterer location and structure interpretation of a target. Experimental results using both simulated and real data are presented to verify the enhanced performance of 2-D resolution in ISAR imaging.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3492503","National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62071113); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20211559); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242022k60008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10751776","Annihilating filter;inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR);off-the-grid compressed sensing (CS);super-resolution","Imaging;Radar imaging;Superresolution;Image resolution;Signal processing algorithms;Radar;Signal resolution;Bandwidth;Antennas and propagation;Microwave filters","","","","39","IEEE","12 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Often, however, EM sensors are accelerating through physical space, which results in modulated frequencies in the time series obtained by the sensor. In this work, we evaluate the effect of receiver acceleration on observed signals in the context of wireless communications and introduce methods to reconstruct the transmitted signal. We analyze the effect of constant acceleration and uniform circular motion which result in sensor time series that are distorted by quadratic and sinusoidal phase changes, creating physical linear and angular chirps, respectively. In a homogeneous medium, the time sampling of the received signal can be transformed to a nonuniform grid to account for the phase modulations induced by acceleration along 3-D trajectories in space. The nonuniform fast Fourier transform can then be applied to recover the spectrum of the transmitted signal. For general EM wave fields, new signal processing techniques need to be developed. We introduce a physics-informed randomized algorithm to analyze and reconstruct transmitted sparse EM signals propagating in inhomogeneous, stratified media using time series data of the electric field obtained from sensors moving along arbitrary trajectories in space.

Either has its limitation, i.e., the lack of higher order interactions in the multipath model and the burdensome or even impractical ray tracing in SBR for low grazing angle cases where extremely large scenes must be considered. In this article, a multipath model enhanced SBR (MP-SBR) technique is proposed to deal with near-field EM scattering prediction for an object on rough surface in both low and high grazing angle cases. A modified rough surface reflection coefficient calculation formulation, which is employed to statistically quantify the coherently reflected fields from the rough surface, is first derived to consider the near-field effect on the multipath scattering fields. Then, the multipath model with the modified reflection coefficient is inserted into the near-field SBR process for a more exact while still efficient calculation of the scattered fields from an object on rough surface, including those not only stimulated from the direct incidence but also from the surface reflected illumination, which originates from the rough surface within the far-away Fresnel zone, as well as the EM interactions among the object and its nearby areas of the underlying surface. The results calculated using the method of moments (MoM) are used to validate the MP-SBR technique.

In general, seawater always fluctuates under the influence of factors such as wind, earthquakes, tidal forces, and ship movements. The undulating waves produce many bright or dark spots of brightness temperature (TB). This complex background may increase the difficulty of object detection for observers and postprocessing algorithms. In this article, we comprehensively assess the polarization properties of PMMW imaging for sea scene observation, both theoretically and experimentally. According to the millimeter-wave radiation propagation model, the TB difference characteristics between ship and seawater under various conditions are calculated and analyzed. Based on the simulated and measured experimental data, the polarization TB and the multipolarization parameter images are qualitatively and quantitatively discussed using performance metrics such as statistical histograms, differential signal-to-noise ratio (DSNR), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and survey scoring. The analysis results show that vertical polarization is usually the optimal polarization observation mode under most conditions. For the long observation distance or very small angle of incidence, different polarization responses might be comparable. In addition, if the system can obtain multipolarization images at the same time, polarization fusion can bring more advantages for target enhancement, detection, and recognition.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3507613","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371159); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province(grant numbers:YQ2023F007); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:FRFCU5710052821); Assisted Project by Heilong Jiang Postdoctoral Funds for Scientific Research Initiation(grant numbers:LBH-Q21093); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10780957","Antenna polarization;passive millimeter-wave (PMMW);polarization selection;radiation propagation;sea scene observation","Marine vehicles;Imaging;Ocean temperature;Radiometers;Sea surface;Antennas;Millimeter wave propagation;Antennas and propagation;Atmospheric modeling;Surface roughness","","2","","45","IEEE","5 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna comprises a ridge gap waveguide (RGW), a set of equal-length microstrip branches, and a printed quasi-Yagi antenna array with inclined arms. Periodic slots are etched on top surface of RGW, which couple energy to microstrip branches from RGW. The microstrip branches then transmit the energy to quasi-Yagi antennas for radiation. Using quasi-Yagi antenna array to enhance the gain makes LWA attractive in mm-Wave applications. Because of the nondispersive characteristics of RGW, the LWA can radiate at a fixed angle within a broadband. By selecting the ratio of period of slots to distance between adjacent radiating elements, the main beam in any forward direction can be realized. For verification, an LWA with a beam direction of 40° is fabricated.

To achieve higher gain, the proposed antenna element is compactly arranged with a larger distance ( $0.57\lambda \times 0.73\lambda $ ) to construct an  $8\times 8$  array integrated in an LTCC package and the maximum gain at the highest frequency can reach 23.7 dBi. Moreover, the array can achieve a good beam scanning capability over a wide band of 40% with a maximum scanning angle up to ±45° (around 92.9% of the theory limit) in H-plane and ±20° (around 91.2% of the theory limit) in E-plane. Meanwhile, the active VSWRs almost always remain below 2.5, enabling perfect impedance matching when scanning at all angles. With these advantages, the proposed design has potential for application in satellite communication systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3491357","Natural Innovation Foundation of China Projects(grant numbers:2116301ZT00205701); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971392,62171186); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750243","Low profile;low temperature cofired ceramics (LTCCs);phased-array antenna (PAA);wideband","Antenna arrays;Dipole antennas;Phased arrays;Antennas;Substrates;Metals;Broadband antennas;Impedance;Wideband;Inductors","","2","","24","IEEE","11 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is further supported by the utilization of double-ringed circular elements, which suppress mutual interference between the two bands, while conventional cross-dipole elements are employed for structural brevity. Through full-wave simulations, it is numerically verified that the proposed RS exhibits excellent radiation performance, independently supporting reflected beam angles of up to 60° at each band. Furthermore, experimental validation of this performance is provided through far-field measurement results obtained from the fabricated RS prototype.

To ensure high precision in sAPD assessment, different surface area weights are assigned to surface voxel blocks based on a defined step size to determine the integral area. In addition, four average methods from two integration shapes of the exposed body surface are discussed to assess the errors caused by splitting the voxel blocks. A realistic ear model and 5G handset antenna arrays at 28 GHz are used for dosimetry analysis. We simulate a real call scenario and discuss the effects of different exposure positions, integration shapes, and antenna rotation angles on the calculation results, and analyze the weights of these potential influence factors. The results demonstrate that in irregular body models, such as the ear, the distribution of EMF energy absorption by human skin is more dispersed and complex. Compared to other factors, the selection of exposure position for absorbed power density (APD) averaging has a greater impact on the sAPD. The proposed algorithm is beneficial for future compliance tests of 5G MMW handset devices for various body parts.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3490035","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271229); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10747191","Absorbed power density (APD);electromagnetic fields (EMFs);handset antenna;human phantom;millimeter wave (MMW);voxelization","Antenna arrays;Avalanche photodiodes;Ear;Antennas;Surface waves;Skin;Telephone sets;5G mobile communication;Shape;Surface reconstruction","","2","","20","IEEE","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By formulating the discrete energy in the energy-based stability analysis technique into a global quadratic form, the global stability condition of the upwind flux-based DGTD method is analytically derived for the first time. In order to achieve the highly efficient stability condition prediction for large and multiscale complicated problems, an elementwise stability condition has been developed by applying matrix decomposition technique into the obtained global stability condition. Due to the sole approximation in the matrix decomposition, the proposed elementwise stability estimation method is more accurate than the traditional energy-based stability analysis techniques, where multiple approximations are employed to achieve the elementwise operations. The numerical examples show the good time step bound estimation accuracy of the global and elementwise stability conditions compared to the widely used energy-based techniques, which significantly enhances the DGTD method’s solution efficiency on time integration.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3501416","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371355); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFA1401001); Shanghai Sailing Program(grant numbers:23YF1445000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767168","Discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method;energy technique;matrix decomposition;stability analysis;upwind flux","Numerical stability;Estimation;Finite element analysis;Stability criteria;Matrix decomposition;Time-domain analysis;Antennas and propagation;Accuracy;Testing;Method of moments","","1","","33","IEEE","25 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this communication, a sidelobe suppression method for the scanning synthetic beams is proposed. First, the fundamental model of the synthetic beam scanning method is presented with the introduction of the directional matching filter. Subsequently, the covariance matrix of the excitation signals is optimized using a convex optimization algorithm. This optimization allows for uniform bunching of the average power pattern within a specific angle range and simultaneous sidelobes’ suppression of the scanning synthetic patterns. In addition to the partially correlated excitation signals without practical constraints, the excitation signals are synthesized using the alternating minimization algorithm when considering a constant modulus constraint. Finally, numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed sidelobe suppression method. The results demonstrate that the SLLs of the synthetic patterns with varying steering angles can be reduced to below −19.5 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3492501","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071371,62471379); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3902400); Foundation of National Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environment(grant numbers:202103014); Aviation Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:20182007002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10751772","Coincidence imaging array radar (CIAR);convex optimization;sidelobe suppression;synthetic beam scanning","Radar imaging;Imaging;Radar;Covariance matrices;Optimization;Phased arrays;Radar antennas;Correlation;Antennas and propagation;Synthetic aperture radar","","","","21","IEEE","12 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
