This method applies generally to electrically small antennas possessing N-fold rotational symmetry. To illustrate the method, it is applied to a top-hat loaded monopole antenna that supports a fundamental radiating mode as well as non-radiating modes that are analogous to discrete orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes. Time-modulated capacitors, placed in each sector, couple these modes using SDTWM. The modulation scheme is similar to that of a classic negative-resistance parametric amplifier, but instead of using the modulation to obtain gain from the system, the modulation parameters are chosen to enhance the matching bandwidth of the antenna. We show how this can be done by choosing an appropriate combination of the modulation depth and modulation frequency. After extending the definition of radiation efficiency and mismatch loss to the case of a parametrically time-varying antenna, the extended definitions are used to characterize the simulated performance of the time-varying antenna under two different SDTWM modulation schemes. The first modulation scheme couples the radiative mode to a single non-radiative mode, while the second modulation scheme couples the radiative mode to two different non-radiative modes. Both schemes yield efficiency-bandwidth products that are 6.4–7.6 dB larger than that of the time-invariant version of the antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3508081","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(grant numbers:DGE-2241144); Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)(grant numbers:2021-2106240007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10785556","Efficiency-bandwidth product;electrically small antennas;impedance matching;interpath relation;time-varying systems;space–time modulation","Antennas;Loaded antennas;Helical antennas;Bandwidth;Integrated circuit modeling;Capacitors;Antenna radiation patterns;Linear systems;Couplings;Q-factor","","1","","47","IEEE","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents the proof-of-concept that such measurements can also be relatively easily performed in a reverberation chamber (RC), which could be assumed to be chaotic. Indeed, in such an environment, due to the cancellation of all the indirect unstirred paths, the only invariant path between the antenna under test (AUT) and the measuring one is the line-of-sight. Therefore, for a given angle of the radiation pattern, multiple acquisitions (i.e., for different stirring conditions) of the transmission coefficient between both antennas and their averaging is theoretically sufficient to extract the line-of-sight (LOS) from the stirred paths. The validity of such an approach is demonstrated from measurements performed between 1 and 25 GHz on two different sets of horn antennas in a low-cost suspended vibrating intrinsic reverberation chamber (VIRC) made of a metallized textile. As shown from these measurements and from an analytical theoretical model developed in this study, the accuracy of such measurements increases with the frequency and can be improved by inserting a few blocks of absorbers within the VIRC.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3503352","“CHAOTIQ” ASTRID project(grant numbers:ANR-20-ASTR-0018); Funded by Direction generale de l’armement (DGA) and Agence de l’Innovation de Defense (AID) and operated by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10768926","Anechoic measurements;antenna radiation pattern;chaos;chaotic cavity;line-of-sight;multipath;radar cross section (RCS);Rayleigh distribution;reverberation chamber (RC);Rician distribution;stirred paths;unstirred paths;vibrating intrinsic reverberation chamber (VIRC)","Antenna measurements;Antenna radiation patterns;Frequency measurement;Analytical models;Scattering parameters;Rotation measurement;Energy measurement;Transmitting antennas;Reverberation chambers;Receiving antennas","","","","22","IEEE","26 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A single ME antenna, hence, constrains the transmitted magnetic field due to the weak magnetic moment and low strain-modulated magnetization efficiency. A multiphysical field driven ME antenna array consisting of double elastic plates sandwiched between multiple arranged PZT8/Metglas/Ni laminates is, hence, proposed, which can enhance the transmitted magnetic field nonlinearly with increased antennas. Here, the accumulated ac strain and magnetic field of multiple antennas intensify with increased antennas and couple in a positive feedback way. Specifically, the ac piezostrain of adjacent antennas couples through the elastic plate along the length direction, enhancing the modulation of neighboring antennas’ magnetization oscillations; meanwhile, the enhanced magnetic coupling among adjacent antennas along the width direction produces additional magnetostrictive strains, which enhance the Q values of converse ME (CME) effect and effective strains propagated in the elastic plate, thereby further improving the transmitted magnetic field. First, an equivalent circuit model based on magnetic and strain-modulated motion equations is proposed to understand and optimize the ME antenna array. Furthermore, due to the multiphysical field driven effect of the fabricated antenna array, the  $3 \times 3$  array can enhance the transmitted magnetic field to 19.8 times compared to that of a single antenna. Such nonlinear improvements can further reach 1337 times for the  $10 \times 10$  antenna array.

First, the proposed antenna utilizes a single-conductor meander line as its radiation structure, which operates in the axial mode to generate an endfire radiation pattern. The radiation structure involves radiation components perpendicular to the endfire direction and transmission components parallel to the endfire direction. Second, the phase constant properties of the proposed meander-line antenna are unique. On the one hand, the phase constant is merely tuned by the length of radiation components. The phase constant increases with the increasing length. On the other hand, the change rate of phase constant versus frequency is only determined by the length of transmission components. The change rate decreases with the increasing length. The independent controllability of the phase constant can facilitate the design and analysis; thus, the Hanson-Woodyard (H-W) condition can be satisfied easily to achieve a high gain. Moreover, the proposed meander-line antenna can gain energy from dual paths including the space and the conductor, achieving uniform aperture distribution and a high gain-to-length ratio. Finally, to verify the proposed design concept, an eight-element planar meander-line endfire antenna is designed and fabricated. The measured maximum gain is 12.0 dBi, resulting in a high gain-to-length ratio of 7.3. Also, the meander-line topology provides a potential solution for compact dual-polarized antennas.

The antenna is implemented as thin-metal meshes on a low-profile substrate ( $\leq 0.01\lambda _{0}$ ), ensuring optical transparency. The array consists of three square patches, each rotated by 45° and fed at two lower edges by T-shaped proximity probes, which excite two orthogonal slant polarizations. The edge lengths of the patches are logarithmically scaled to achieve multiple resonant frequencies, resulting in a broad matching bandwidth. The coupled T-probe structure facilitates efficient feeding of the patches without the need for additional precise tuning, allowing for uniform impedance matching independent of patch length. Since the log-periodic patches radiate primarily at their resonant frequencies, the total radiating fields remain consistent across a wide frequency range, producing flat gains. In addition, the proposed design achieves lower cross-polarization levels due to the cancellation of currents induced in the T-probe on the opposite side. To validate the design approach, a  $3\times 1$  array with a feeding network was fabricated and tested. The measured −10-dB impedance bandwidth is 23.7% ( $24.9-31.6$  GHz), and the 3-dB gain bandwidth is 21.1% ( $24.6-30.4$  GHz) with a peak gain of 7.65 dBi at 27.7 GHz.

This article presents an effective dielectric dome lens (DDL) for a uniform array with one-wavelength interelement spacing, enabling beam scanning with reduced grating lobes (GLs), making it suitable for millimeter-wave communication systems. The shape of the DDL is optimized using the geometric optics (GO) algorithm, allowing for the reflection of GLs while maintaining effective main beam scanning. The DDL is then miniaturized, integrated with absorber sheets to dissipate reflected GLs, and equipped with matching layers (MLs) to improve radiation performance. The subsequent full-wave simulation further optimizes the design, accounting for factors overlooked by the GO algorithm and finalizing the DDL structure for operating with a undersampled array. Finally, a  $3 \times 8$  undersampled rectangular patch array working at 28 GHz, integrated with a cylinder DDL, is fabricated and measured to validate the design approach. The experimental results are in agreement with the simulations. With the help of the DDL, the array with one-wavelength interelement spacing achieves a continuous, symmetrical-to-boresight beam-scanning range of 110°, with a scan loss (SL) within 3 dB.

Next, a low-cost 1-bit planar digital array without any feeding networks is proposed by coding the 0°/180° phase states of each mode/element. To match the circular/cylindrical/spherical scenarios, the planar digital array evolves into a conformal format. Here, to further lower the complexity and cost, the spatial phase difference of the digital conformal array is cleverly compensated by utilizing a metasurface layer rather than conventional phase-delay-line designs. By controlling the 1-bit phase states of each element, the radiation aperture of the digital conformal array is represented as a “0/1” binary sequence, which leads to an RIS-like multibeam switching capability. Moreover, by introducing the initial phase, a new 1-bit digital array with a single-beam steering capability is extended to further explore its application potential. To validate the concept, a four-element 1-bit digital conformal array was fabricated and measured.

For low-power microwave (LPM) incidence, the proposed design has a high-efficiency transmission window adjacent to two wide absorption bands independent of the incident polarization. As the incident power increases, the co-designed phased array exhibits a nonlinear transmission response. For HPM incidence scenarios, regardless of the polarization, the transmission band disappears and converts to an absorption band.

An  $8\times 8$  co-designed phased array prototype is fabricated and measured in the far-field microwave anechoic chamber to demonstrate its scattering and radiation functions. The measured 10-dB radar cross section (RCS) reduction of the co-designed integrated phased array is from 2.22 to 7.29 GHz under co-polarized LPM incidence as well as from 2.3 to 3.64 GHz and 3.95 to 6.66 GHz under cross-polarized LPM incidence.

In this article, for the first time, a reconfigurable GJC matrix as a multibeam feed network (MFN) is reported using planar circuits and verified experimentally. Beam steering is realized by a series of novel low-loss tunable reflection-type phase shifters (RTPSs), which are modeled and thoroughly analyzed. Based on the hybrid couplers and tunable phase shifters, a  $2\times 8$  reconfigurable GJC matrix is modeled and simulated using planar microstrip lines, and prototype is fabricated and tested.

To suppress the two stopbands and the grating lobe, we propose and investigate a novel PLWA based on GS unit cells, in which each unit cell consists of two identical sub-unit cells, with each sub-unit cell containing two nonidentical slots. The two nonidentical slots are adopted to suppress the open stopband by quarter-wavelength impedance matching, while the unit cell with GS is employed to suppress the next coming stopband by three-quarter-wavelength impedance matching. Additionally, the antenna with GS avoids the next coming stopband and the grating lobe by directly suppressing the  $n= -2$  space harmonic. With the simultaneous suppression of he two stopbands and the grating lobe, the PLWA generates a single beam that continuously scans from the near backward to forward endfire directions.

The 1-bit active coding is designed based on the current reversal method, which realizes two states with 180° phase difference over the frequency range of 8.5–11 GHz by switching two p-i-n diodes for both left-handed CP (LHCP) and right-handed CP (RHCP) incidence.

The attributed scattering center (ASC) model has seven parameters: scattering intensity, 2-D coordinates, frequency-dependent factor, length, orientation angle, and aspect-dependent factor. While these parameters describe the geometric structure and electromagnetic scattering characteristics of a target concisely and accurately, they can also serve as features in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) tasks. Therefore, the ASC model finds widespread use in ATR. The extraction of ASC model parameters represents a high-dimensional, nonlinear, and nonconvex optimization problem. In this study, an innovative method for the ASC model parameter extraction is proposed. Initially, the proposed method simplifies the ASC model by eliminating the nonlinear term sinc, resulting in the simplified ASC (SASC) model with four parameters: scattering intensity, 2-D coordinates, and frequency-dependent factor. Subsequently, an improved estimating signal parameter via the rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT) algorithm is proposed and used to estimate the SASC model’s parameters. A binary graph is then constructed using the 2-D coordinates of the SASC model. Furthermore, both localized ASC (L-ASC) and distributed ASC (D-ASC) are distinguished from the binary graph, and their parameters, including 2-D coordinates, length, and orientation angle, are calculated. Finally, the frequency-dependent factor and scattering intensity are determined by search and least-squares methods, respectively. The proposed method accurately estimates the ASC model parameters in the frequency domain without the need for image segmentation or an iteration procedure, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Simulations and experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3502907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10797655","Attributed scattering center (ASC);estimating signal parameter via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT) algorithm;parameter estimation;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Scattering;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Diffraction;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar imaging;Image segmentation;Computational efficiency;Target recognition;Radar scattering","","1","","47","IEEE","13 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In electromagnetic simulations, equivalent boundary conditions represent metafilms for their easy modeling. Nonlocal two-sided boundary conditions of the second order provide adequate modeling accuracy for most metafilms. This article considers a planar metafilm waveguide described by the indicated boundary conditions. It is demonstrated that the classic approach for waveguide eigenmode determination does not provide correct results when applied to the metafilms with nonlocal boundary conditions. The reasons for the incorrectness are some unusual properties of metafilms with nonlocal boundary conditions and the requirement to satisfy a so-called boundary-contact condition for an irregular metafilm, which provides the uniqueness of a boundary-contact problem solution. A novel approach is introduced for correctly determining continuous and discrete eigenmode spectrums in open and shielded waveguides with nonlocal two-sided boundary conditions. An irregular metafilm in a parallel-plate waveguide is considered. It is demonstrated that using the corrected eigenmodes satisfies the boundary-contact condition at the point of irregularity. Some numerical results are presented, demonstrating the calculating accuracy of the proposed analytical approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3528760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10845072","Boundary-contact problem;metafilms;nonlocal boundary conditions;two-sided boundary conditions;waveguide eigenmodes","Boundary conditions;Surface waves;Metasurfaces;Impedance;Differential operators;Surface impedance;Planar waveguides;Periodic structures;Anisotropic;Admittance","","","","28","IEEE","17 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach considerably reduces the number of sampling points required for NF measurement and thus improves measurement efficiency. The high-resolution NF data reconstructed by the network are further processed by a near-field-to-far-field (NF2FF) transformation to obtain far-field (FF) antenna radiation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the NFS-Net exhibits both accuracy and generalizability in restoring high-resolution NF data from low-resolution input. The NF measurement workflow that combines the NFS-Net and the NF2FF algorithm enables accurate radiation pattern characterization with only 11% of the Nyquist rate samples.

The multimode periodic structure, capable of scattering into several anomalous angles through manipulation of reactive loads, is then cropped into finite-sized arrays, and the quantization effects of the load reactances on the array scattering are analyzed. An experimental anomalous reflector is demonstrated with a comparison between simulated and measured scattering performance.

However, acquiring radio channels in practical deployment scenarios and replaying recorded channels in the laboratory setup, which is the essence for the VDT framework, still present significant challenges. Passive channel sounding, which can capture radio channels in the live cellular network, becomes a promising strategy. However, channel modeling and emulation based on data collected in passive channel-sounding campaign have not been well addressed in the state-of-art. In this work, we propose a novel channel modeling and emulation framework for the recorded channel data by the passive channel sounder, to achieve the VDT purpose. To demonstrate our proposed framework, a channel measurement campaign was conducted in the fifth-generation (5G) commercial network based on the home-developed passive channel sounder. The estimated multipath components based on the recorded channel data demonstrate that the base station (BS) beamforming can significantly impact the radio channels. The performance of different commercial user equipment (UE) is then evaluated under the recorded and emulated radio channels in the laboratory setup, where different figures-of-metrics (FoMs), including reference signal receiving power (RSRP), modulation and coding scheme (MCS), and throughput, were thoroughly analyzed.

Accurately predicting the maximum usable frequency (MUF) is crucial for improving the efficiency of HF ionospheric propagation. However, when there are only a limited number of ground-based stations for vertical ionospheric sounding, it becomes challenging to infer and predict MUFs in unfamiliar territories. In this article, we present a personalized federated learning framework that utilizes mutual information to make spatiotemporal inferences for MUFs across multiple stations. To begin with, we extract the trend component using time-series decomposition theory and then verify its significant spatial correlation using dynamic time warping (DTW). This enables us to identify the spatial relationships present in the local models of the federated learning system. Next, by monitoring changes in mutual information among different local models during the training phase of the trend component, we verify the existence of these spatial relationships. Furthermore, we introduce and validate the effectiveness of the personalization strategy employed in the proposed framework. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) in MUF predictions for ten cities with varying geographic latitudes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3516324","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62327802,62425118,62231027,62171462,62101594); Key Technologies Research and Development Program of Jiangsu (Prospective and Key Technologies for Industry)(grant numbers:BE2023022,BE2023022-4); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807123","High-frequency communication;ionospheric vertical sounding;maximum usable frequency (MUF);personalized federated learning;time-series decomposition","Federated learning;Correlation;Predictive models;Ionosphere;Distributed databases;Data models;Mathematical models;Deep learning;Time-frequency analysis;Accuracy","","","","42","IEEE","18 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A unique requirement of near-field focused antennas is the requirement to characterize both transverse and axial resolutions. We begin by revisiting the classical scalar Fresnel-Kirchhoff’s diffraction integral and the assumptions involved in obtaining a closed-form solution of the integral. These closed-form solutions are then analyzed in depth to reveal the dependency of the resolution on the array size, focal length, and the frequency (wavelength) of operation. These observations are validated via a representative phased array consisting of infinitesimal dipoles which radiates vector fields. This simulation model serves as the basis to assess the domain of applicability of the closed-form solutions and reveals insightful dependencies of the near-field resolution on the geometry and frequency.

Standard Doppler analysis estimates signal distortions by assuming that all objects in the system travel at a constant velocity. The increasing speed and complexity of modern systems, however, requires an understanding of how the general 3-D motion of the sensor distorts the signal. In this work, we establish and interpret the spectral perturbations caused by changes in speed, i.e., acceleration and jolt, and by changes in the direction of velocity, i.e., the 3-D geometry of the receiver path, which together form the building blocks of arbitrary nonlinear motion. For constant jolt, the transmitted signal is distorted by a nonlinear chirp, which results in nonuniform spectral broadening and can create Airy-type oscillations in the amplitude spectrum. We identify sensor path approximations that incorporate the nonlinear phases induced by the 3-D geometry: the helical and Frenet-Serret approximations, which result in sinusoidal and cubic phase signals, respectively. We characterize the dependence of the spectrum on curvature, torsion, and the relative direction of wave propagation to the Frenet-Serret frame.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3533904","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-23-1-0177); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10858678","Chirp modulation;Doppler effect;electromagnetic propagation;geometric modeling;harmonic analysis;low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites;receiving antennas;sensor systems and applications","Receivers;Trajectory;Three-dimensional displays;Time-frequency analysis;Geometry;Antennas and propagation;Low earth orbit satellites;Nonlinear distortion;Estimation;Doppler shift","","","","27","CCBY","30 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This communication presents a novel integrated-antenna-filter with a metal-dielectric heterogeneous resonator to address this issue. The heterogeneous resonator is a dielectric block with two sides covered in silver strips. For the antenna channel, the proposed resonator functions as a dielectric resonator (DR) to generate radiation, and its resonance properties after loading silver strips are theoretically investigated. Two resonant modes of the DR are combined to enhance antenna bandwidth. For the filter channel, the silver strips act as two-stage resonators and are coupled to each other through the dielectric block. The dielectric block here is considered a nonresonant dielectric waveguide (DW) with low loss, which differs from conventional integrated schemes, thereby avoiding the need for additional shielding. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous resonator offers a wide tuning range for the frequency ratios of the two channels. An impedance bandwidth of 7.7% and a peak gain of 6.7 dBi are achieved for the antenna channel, while a 3-dB bandwidth of 16.1% and an insertion loss near 0.75 dB are obtained for the filter channel with a profile of  $0.076\lambda _{0}$ .","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3507618","MOST(grant numbers:2022YFA1203003); RGC Hong Kong(grant numbers:AoE/E-101/23-N); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10780940","Antenna and filter;enhanced bandwidth;function integration;heterogeneous resonator;low insertion loss","Filters;Dielectrics;Antennas;Electric fields;Dielectric resonator antennas;Bandwidth;Silver;Insertion loss;Couplings;Microstrip filters","","","","41","IEEE","5 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wide bandwidth is achieved by simultaneously exciting and compressing first-order (odd) and second-order (even) modes, enabling their combination. The offset-fed method is used to simultaneously excite the first- and second-order modes of the dipole. The second-order mode is compressed by widening one of the dipole arms, which shifts the second-order mode toward lower frequencies. The first-order mode can be compressed by shortening the length of the thin arm of the dipole that is not widened, which shifts the first-order mode toward higher frequencies. In addition, to convert the second-order mode splitting radiation pattern into an omnidirectional one, parasitic strips are loaded on both sides of the thin arm of the dipole. This loading also helps to further compress the first-order mode toward lower frequencies. The final antenna design features an asymmetric structure. To validate the concept, a prototype was constructed and tested, demonstrating reasonable agreement between the simulated and measured results. The measured impedance bandwidth is 55.6% (1.62–2.87 GHz), and a stable omnidirectional radiation pattern can be maintained across the entire operating frequency band.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3524412","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:92373202); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LZ24F010006); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LQ24F010010,LD24F010001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10832516","Broadband antenna;dipole antennas;mode compression;omnidirectional antenna","Dipole antennas;Broadband antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Loading;Impedance;Resonant frequency;Loaded antennas;Substrates;Fats;Wideband","","","","20","IEEE","7 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To alleviate these challenges, this communication proposes a deep image prior (DIP)-based modeling framework to facilitate fast-forward modeling of large-scale problems. This framework leverages an unsupervised learning network with super-resolution capability, requiring only the low-resolution field distribution portrait in the model as input. The low-resolution field is initially generated using the conventional finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) method with a coarse mesh. Through iterative updates, the network produces a refined field distribution that achieves an accuracy comparable to that obtained with a mesh twice as dense as the original one. In addition, an automated termination criterion is introduced for DIP iteration. Extensive numerical experiments validate the super-resolution capability of our method in handling 2-D scattering problems with diverse shapes and material properties. In addition, a large-scale model is deployed to demonstrate the generalization capability of the proposed modeling framework for realistic applications. Notably, the proposed method exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to conventional FDFD for large-scale modeling, as it only requires forward modeling on a coarse mesh. By eliminating the need for training data and demonstrating good generalization capability, this method shows significant potential in addressing the challenges posed by conventional modeling techniques, particularly in terms of the intensive computational overhead associated with large-scale problems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3532082","Science and Technology Innovation Yongjiang 2035(grant numbers:2024Z140); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62301288); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10856807","Deep image prior (DIP);electromagnetic forward modeling;finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD);super-resolution;unsupervised learning","Electronics packaging;Computational modeling;Mathematical models;Electromagnetics;Finite difference methods;Electric fields;Accuracy;Superresolution;Antennas and propagation;Data models","","","","18","IEEE","28 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By training a surrogate model with prior observations to estimate the posterior performance of fusion skeletons, the proposed method recognizes more promising fusion skeletons and samples them with a higher probability, and the sampled skeletons are used to further update the surrogate for a better estimation. To balance the exploration and exploitation during sampling iterations, a temperature-annealed sampling strategy is adopted. The proposed method is validated by optimizing the fusion skeleton of a multimodal model to estimate the EM responses of a complex frequency-selective rasorber and a metasurface absorber. Numeric results demonstrate that satisfying fusion skeletons can be found within several iterations so that the accuracy and efficiency of estimating EM responses are enhanced. A rough guideline can also be drawn that the fusion between late features from vectorized structural parameters and early features from binarized patterns should be prioritized for better estimation performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3533884","Aeronautical Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:20230018053003); Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University(grant numbers:CX2024064); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:D5000240266); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10858661","Feature fusion;metasurface;multimodal model;sequential sampling","Skeleton;Metasurfaces;Optimization;Feature extraction;Structural engineering;Estimation;Computational modeling;Fuses;Training;Kernel","","","","24","IEEE","30 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
