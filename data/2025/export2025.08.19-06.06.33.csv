By utilizing the fluidity of the liquid induced by gravity and the symmetric configuration with specific feeding methods, the movable liquid part effectively functions as a 3-D director for both the slot and dielectric HEM113 modes. This enables wideband 3-D passive beam steering, even under conditions of random or unpredictable 3-D rotation of the antenna system. The theory and operation mechanism of 3-D beam steering is investigated from different perspectives, including the modal field analysis and the viewpoint of a short dielectric waveguide model. The antenna evolution from basic DRA to the proposed antenna is also introduced. Simultaneous 3-D beam steering and polarization diversity are achieved, which can greatly reduce the polarization mismatch due to the multipath effect for indoor applications and improve communication link stability. The proposed antenna exhibits a wide bandwidth, high stability, environmental shielding, and ease of installation without predetermining the installation angles. Its true passivity, without external drives or active components, ensures flexibility, compact size, and low cost.

A shorted vertical cavity is first created in the center of the rectangular patch for the integration of filters. Since the patch antenna operates at the TM10 mode, the center-located shorted vertical cavity does not affect the operation mode of the patch antenna. A multicoupled miniaturized filter is then designed and inserted into the vertical cavity. A feeding structure from the patch down to the ground is created to excite the radiating patch to realize the single-fed patch FiA (SFiA). The fabricated SFiA features a compact size of  $0.42\lambda _{\mathrm {g}} \times 0.4\lambda _{\mathrm {g}} \times 0.1\lambda _{\mathrm {g}}$ , excellent filtering performance (return loss of 15 dB, insertion loss of 0.6 dB, wide stopband width of  $1.6{f} _{0}$ , high selectivity, and so on), and good antenna performance (unidirectional radiation, stable gain of 6.0 dBi, low back radiation of below -20 dB, and so on). Furthermore, a differential-fed patch FiA (DFiA) with a size of  $0.44\lambda _{\mathrm {g}} \times 0.42\lambda _{\mathrm {g}} \times 0.1\lambda _{\mathrm {g}}$  is developed to enhance radiation performance, with two filters incorporated into the vertical cavity. Apart from demonstrating almost the same excellent filtering performance as the SFiA, the DFiA can provide a higher gain of 6.4 dBi, and stable and symmetrical E- and H-plane radiation patterns, along with lower cross-polarization levels of less than -20 dB. With the excellent filtering and antenna performance in such a compact structure, the proposed patch FiAs would be attractive candidates for modern wireless communication systems, such as sixth-generation (6G) mobile communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3545693","Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research(grant numbers:2023B0303000008); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2024B1515020097); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:92373109); Shenzhen Strategic Emerging Industry Support Plan(grant numbers:F-2023-Z99-509043); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:20231121173623001); Shenzhen University 2035 Program for Excellent Research(grant numbers:2024B001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10909222","Differential-fed antenna;filter in antenna (FiA);patch antenna","Filters;Antennas;Antenna accessories;Patch antennas;Antenna feeds;Antenna radiation patterns;Electric fields;Training;Substrates;Radio frequency","","","","34","IEEE","3 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It can be specialized to each of these cases individually or can describe a structure containing all three electromagnetic phenomena simultaneously in a single antenna. This very general dispersion equation (GDE) is derived using both mode matching and the transverse resonance method, the latter lacking the ability to provide the field descriptions and wave impedances with the advantage of computational simplicity. The dispersion equation is first used to design a parity-time symmetric waveguide consisting of conjugate impedance sheets coupled in close proximity. The example shows both the eigenvalues (wavenumbers) and eigenvectors (modes) coalescing at a single point in the parameter space known as the exceptional point. In another example, the same dispersion equation is again used to model a sinusoidally modulated reactive sheet (SMRS) supported by an active impedance sheet-backed dielectric spacer. The active impedance sheet is designed to compensate for the SMRS radiative leakage loss when coupled in close proximity. Hence, each spatial harmonic is described by a purely real wavenumber despite the radiative losses to the open far-field channel. Plots of the spatial harmonics show a constant amplitude envelope and hence leaky wave radiation is generated from spatial harmonics which do not decay as they leak. Full-wave simulations corroborate our results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3556286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10949667","Coupled mode theory;leaky wave antennas;parity-time (PT) symmetry;sinusoidally modulated reactive sheet (SMRS)","Dispersion;Mathematical models;Impedance;Harmonic analysis;Leaky wave antennas;Modulation;Surface waves;Surface impedance;Magnetic fields;Geometry","","","","20","IEEE","4 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna structure can produce true efficiency zeros (EZs) at both sides of the operating band across the beamwidth, not restricted to the boresight. The filtering antenna comprises three coupled radiators. The driven inverted-F radiating element is directly excited from the port, while the other two parasitic radiators are excited through electromagnetic coupling with the driven radiator. By controlling the resonant frequencies and the coupling relationships, a transversal filtering antenna (TFA) with a third-order filtering response is realized with all quarter-wavelength radiators. The antenna exhibits an EZ on each side of its passband, significantly enhancing its selectivity and thereby enabling the suppression of interference from out-of-band signals. The design method of the proposed filtering antenna is presented. Some design guidelines are provided. Without increasing the antenna footprint, the techniques introduced in this work are not only helpful for improving selectivity but also very useful for bandwidth enhancement of conventional unbalanced antennas. To validate this technology, an antenna for the 5G new-radio (NR) frequency band is designed, fabricated, and measured. The experimental results align very well with the simulations. To evaluate the out-of-band interference suppression, a dual-antenna system was constructed and tested, with one antenna operating at the NR band (3.3–5 GHz, 42%) and the other antenna operating at the Wi-Fi band (5.15–7.125 GHz, 32%).

Meanwhile, the fifth-generation (5G) systems have already started to operate in the millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) bands. Therefore, dual-band antennas, which can operate for both 5G and 6G bands simultaneously, with circularly polarized (CP) radiation, are attractive for future wireless communication. However, achieving dual-band CP radiations, at frequencies as high as 100 GHz, is quite challenging. In this work, a novel dual-band, CP, eight-port multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna is presented. The proposed CP MIMO configuration comprises an orthogonally placed four-element shared-aperture Vivaldi antenna and a linear-to-dual-circular polarization (LDCP) converter, operating at the frequencies of 40 GHz (5G mm-Wave band) and 110 GHz (6G sub-THz band). The shared-aperture Vivaldi antenna, proposed as the excitation source for the LDCP converter, demonstrates high gain, compact size, and endfire linearly polarized (LP) radiation for dual-wideband operation (5G/6G). The designed dual-band LDCP converter has a compact unit cell size ( $0.16\lambda $  at 40 GHz) and works for both horizontal and vertical polarizations. The fabricated prototype demonstrates a measured left-hand circular polarized (LHCP) bandwidth (BW) from 39 to 45 GHz (14.2%) for the 5G band and a right-hand circular polarized (RHCP) BW from 98 to 110 GHz (11.5%) for the 6G band. For the first time, we demonstrate a dual-band, dual-CP eight-port MIMO antenna with polarization (LHCP/RHCP) and spatial (30° incidence angle difference) diversity at the 5G/6G bands, making it a suitable candidate for future integrated 5G/6G communication systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3550327","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10930511","Circular polarization;dual band;fifth generation (5G);millimeter wave (mm-Wave);multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna;polarization converter;shared aperture;sixth-generation (6G) Vivaldi antenna","Antennas;5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;Vivaldi antennas;Dual band;Design methodology;Communication systems;Apertures;Base stations;Dipole antennas","","","","55","IEEE","18 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Exhibiting a linear phase range of over 800° at the center frequency (12.6 GHz) and maintaining an error of less than 45° across various frequencies compared to the TTD model, this element showcases exceptional dual-polarized wideband reflectarray performance. Measurement results show a maximum gain of 31.2 dBi at 12.6 GHz and 31 dBi at 13.5 GHz for vertical and horizontal polarizations (H-Pol), respectively. A 1-dB gain bandwidth of approximately 21% and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of around 31% are achieved for the vertical and H-Pols in an offset feed configuration. Sidelobe levels (SLLs) are maintained below −13 dB, while cross-polarization in vertical polarization (V-Pol) is kept under −30 dB across the entire band. For H-Pol, cross-polarization is maintained below −29 dB across the band, while SLLs remain better than −16 dB. Aperture efficiency measurements indicate values up to 57% and not less than 28% over the band.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3550364","Consortium for Research and Innovation in Aerospace in Quebec (CRIAQ)(grant numbers:AROBAS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10930439","Dual polarized;linear phase curve;microstrip patch;phase delay lines;reflectarray;satellite communications;true time delay (TTD);wideband","Wideband;Reflector antennas;Feeds;Delay lines;Microstrip;Couplings;Satellite communications;Substrates;Satellite antennas;Nonhomogeneous media","","1","","20","IEEE","17 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents a  $2\times 2$  STAR MIMO antenna that utilizes a usual stacked patch array while effectively suppressing all three types of interferences throughout the 5-GHz Wi-Fi spectrum. Moreover, these interference suppressions are accomplished when the TX-RX polarization of this antenna is nonorthogonal within one channel and between channels at the same time. In this work, a circularly polarization-linearly polarization (CP-LP) scheme with a broadband coupling adjustment (BCA) approach is proposed to minimize SI by producing wideband cancellation between residual TX-to-RX couplings. Metal walls with slot structures on the ground were designed to prevent interferences between channels while preserving antenna impedance matching. A prototype of the nonorthogonal polarized STAR MIMO antenna was constructed, showing good agreement between simulation and measurement. At  $5.1\sim 5.85$  GHz, it simultaneously suppresses all three interferences below –40 dB, with peak gains exceeding 7 dBic for TX and 8.7 dBi for RX, making this antenna promising for Wi-Fi-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3550436","Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:GJHZ20220913142601002,JCYJ20220530145211026); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022A1515011314); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10934136","Interference suppression;integrated sensing and communication (ISAC);multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) antenna;nonorthogonal polarization;simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR)","Stars;Antennas;Substrates;Wireless fidelity;Receiving antennas;Integrated sensing and communication;Metals;Interference suppression;Couplings;Couplers","","","","43","IEEE","19 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed rotary joint incorporates two WR-22 to groove gap waveguide transitions, connected back-to-back with an innovative transformer. A key advantage of gap waveguide technology is its ability to operate without physical contact between the rotary joint’s components, allowing the rotor to rotate freely near the stator with an air gap, while wave leakage is suppressed. By replacing common coaxial connectors with standard waveguide flanges and introducing a novel transformer between the rotor and stator, we have successfully developed a wideband rotary joint suitable for mmWaves. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this concept, we designed a rotenna with 360° mechanical beam steering. This design addresses the common limitations of electronically steerable antennas, such as limited steering range, gain degradation, and high cost and complexity. To validate the concept, the prototypes of the proposed rotary joint and rotenna were fabricated and measured. The measured and simulated results show good agreement.

However, most contributions in this area have focused on constructing surrogate models for antenna optimization using supervised machine learning. These surrogate models can quickly evaluate antenna design solutions but cannot directly modify the design variables to drive optimization. To address this limitation, this article designs two neural networks to assist the differential evolution (DE) algorithm in optimizing antennas. The first is an evolutionary neural network (ENN), which learns the modification patterns of DE on antenna design variables, thereby enhancing the probability of producing more optimal solutions. The second is an inverse cascade network, constructed by first creating multiple inverse subnetworks for each frequency point and then synthesizing the outputs of these subnetworks using a cascade network. This type of neural network can directly output high-quality solutions based on specific requirements. Finally, by integrating these two networks with DE, an AI-assisted antenna optimization method is realized.

However, the ring-up/down process requires a prolonged duration due to the narrowband characteristics of a high-Qm ME antenna, which causes severe intersymbol interference (ISI) and significantly limits the data transmission rate when conventional modulation schemes [e.g., amplitude shift keying (ASK)] are adopted. In this work, we propose a predistortion waveform design to suppress the ISI when transmitting a bitstream with high symbol rate for a narrowband ME antenna. Different from the arbitrary waveform design without any constraints, we limit the peak voltage of the predistortion waveform three times the level of the stable value after considering an economic power amplifier design. Accordingly, a modified binary ASK (modified BASK) modulation scheme is established. Experimental and simulation results show that modified BASK achieves a fivefold bandwidth improvement with only a 20% reduction in efficiency. Experimental results show that reliable communication rate based on the proposed waveform design can reach 1000 bps at a 15 m communication distance, while the counterpart for conventional BASK method is only 500 bps with 10 m distance. The proposed predistortion waveform and the established modulation method circumvent the mutual limitation between the information bandwidth and the physical bandwidth for a very-low frequency (VLF) mechanical antenna and are believed to speed up the communication application for ME antennas in VLF band.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3555109","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3205700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U22A2019,52102127); Open Research Fund of Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory(grant numbers:2023SLABFK01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10955134","Intersymbol interference (ISI);magnetoelectric (ME);mechanical antenna;predistortion waveform design;very-low-frequency (VLF) communication","Antennas;Bandwidth;Modulation;Predistortion;Amplitude shift keying;Dipole antennas;Amorphous magnetic materials;Transmitting antennas;Transfer functions;Symbols","","","","36","IEEE","7 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has previously been established in the literature that when intermodulation distortion is generated by signals incident on a phased array, the intermodulation distortion signal component has a linear phase relationship across the elements in the array such that the intermodulation distortion behaves as if it has an apparent angle of arrival. It is shown in this article that the SLLs associated with the intermodulation distortion signal components are significantly higher than the SLLs of the fundamental signals as a result of the error levels increasing through the nonlinear components. This is confirmed with a measurement campaign of 14 different test scenarios, in which the average SLLs of the intermodulation distortion were 7.6 dB higher than the average SLLs of the fundamental signals. When the receiver is beam steered to a direction away from the apparent angle of the intermodulation distortion, the predicted SLL can be used to calculate an effective third-order intercept of the receiver that takes into account the anticipated spatial rejection of the beamformer. This information helps predict the system performance of a phased array receiver in the presence of nearby interfering signals and can help determine receiver linearity requirements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3556278","Office of Naval Research under Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA)(grant numbers:N00024-22-D-6404); TaskOrder(grant numbers:N00024-23-F-8189); expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of Defense or the U.S. Government; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10949670","Array errors;digital arrays;digital beamforming;dynamic range;intermodulation distortion;linearity;nonlinearities;phased arrays;sidelobe levels (SLLs)","Intermodulation distortion;Phased arrays;Receivers;Interference;Array signal processing;Linearity;Signal to noise ratio;Dynamic range;Distortion measurement;Radio frequency","","","","26","IEEE","4 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it faces the grating lobe challenge when they are formed into an array. This article investigates the factors that affect the rectangular lattice large-element array’s sidelobe levels (SLLs). Results show that the sidelobes are independent of element spacing but closely related to aperture efficiency (AE) and array scale. The element’s AE and number in the arraying dimension are suggested to be at least 82% and 4, respectively. The lens is selected as the large element’s architecture because its optimized feed and phase-shifting surface make it relatively easy to achieve a higher field uniformity, that is, a higher AE. Methods for extracting the 1-D aperture efficiencies of a 2-D region are proposed in this article to validate the derived SLL rules in full-wave simulations, and a simplified form is employed for the rapid optimization of architectural parameters. Finally, a  $4\times 4$  scale high AE lens array is designed with an element size of  $6\lambda _{0} \times 10\lambda _{0}$ .

Specifically, the frequencies with an absorption rate exceeding 80% are within the ranges of 3.3–5.1 and 7.8–9.4 GHz, while the frequency range with transmission exceeding –3 dB spans from 5.69 to 5.92 GHz. Meanwhile, the transmission phase can be adjusted among four states: 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, enabling beam steering of ARTA. Compared to designs for nonreconfigurable transmissive arrays, our design methodology necessitates the satisfaction of absorbing performance under different phase states. For validation, a prototype sample, comprising a  $12 \times 12$  array structured with five metallic layers and four dielectric layers, sandwiching an air layer in between, has been fabricated and tested.

Unlike conventional filtering techniques based on magnitude response, the proposed filtering RA solely manipulates the phase responses of the reflected wave under the total reflection condition. An isosceles triangle patch radiator loaded with slots is employed as the unit cell. Two sets of orthogonal resonant modes of the triangular patch are exploited to produce a phase difference between the u- and v-polarized components. By adopting slot loading, the first- and third-order resonant states are induced in the two orthogonal directions. Next, the phase difference is fully controlled by adjusting the slope of the reflection phase. In the passband, the phase difference is maintained at 180°, while outside the band, it rapidly rolls down (up) to 0° (360°), enabling steep band edges. Finally, a CP filtering RA using the optimized element is constructed for the first time, which verifies the validity of the proposed method.

However, nonorthogonal linear polarization multiplexing often results in high crosstalk between different channels. Moreover, the multidegree-of-freedom control of the Jones matrix on a single meta-atom structure is very complex. In this article, a new supercell is designed by combining the polarization response characteristics of four independent meta-atoms, resulting in a subwavelength structure ( $0.64\lambda $ ) that precisely satisfies the target Jones matrix requirements, with nearly 360° phase coverage from a single meta-atom. In addition, artificially designed noncorrelated noise is introduced to eliminate crosstalk between different channels, ensuring that the correlation coefficients of the target channels do not deteriorate significantly. To verify the feasibility of this method, the functionality of the four channels is designed with quasi-nondiffractive beams with different deflection angles, and the performance of the proposed polarization multiplexing metasurface is analyzed using simulations and experiments. The experimental results show that nearly 50% of the energy is distributed to the target areas, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each channel also exhibits good performance close to 10.

Unfortunately, they have been plagued by the “broadside issue,” characterized by a degradation in gain when the antenna’s main beam is steered across the broadside. While this issue has been addressed by circuit and network approaches, a related fundamental and general electromagnetic theory has been lacking. This article fills this gap. We first show that a P-LWA is a parity-time-symmetric (PT-symmetric) system, whose even- and odd-mode coupling in the complex space of temporal frequencies leads to the characteristic pair of two-sheet Riemann surfaces. We observe that the branch cuts of these surfaces, which form the well-known PT-symmetric double pitchfork spectrum, correspond to the “balanced frequency” condition, while the branch point at the junction of the pitchforks, is an exceptional point (EP) that corresponds to the “Q-balanced” condition, two conditions that were previously shown to be the conditions for eliminating the broadside issue. In order to acquire an independent and rigorous interpretation of this spectrum, we further transform the coupled complex temporal eigenfrequencies into complex spatial eigenfrequencies. We identify the resulting spatial frequencies as coupled forward-backward modes, with frequency-independent real parts (leakage factors), a condition for P-LWA equalization across broadside. Finally, we derive the scattering parameters of the P-LWA and show that matching is achieved only at one of the two ends of the P-LWA structure. This work both provides a solid foundation to the theory of P-LWAs and represents an original contribution to the field of PT-symmetry.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3556308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10949201","Complex temporal and spatial frequencies;coupled-mode theory;exceptional point (EP);leaky wave antennas;periodic structures;PT-symmetry;space scanning;space-time mapping","Couplings;Gain;Periodic structures;Leaky wave antennas;Electromagnetics;Electromagnetic fields;Degradation;Antenna arrays;Training;Time-domain analysis","","","","33","IEEE","4 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, their practical deployment is hindered by varying divergence characteristics across vortex modes with different mode numbers. To overcome this challenge and enable true spatial multiplexing of orbital angular momentum (OAM) waves, a dual-polarized shared-aperture metasurface is proposed. By leveraging both polarization and OAM multiplexing, quasiperfect vortex (QPV) EM waves with coaxial beams and equal divergence radii are successfully generated at microwave frequencies. Initially, the properties of QPV waves in the microwave band are analyzed, followed by the design of a dual-polarized metasurface unit. This unit integrates parasitic damping-coupled patches based on the traditional Jerusalem cross structure, providing polarization-independent control and approximately 360° phase-tuning capability. Furthermore, simulations validate the effectiveness of the dual-polarized single-mode metasurface design. Based on this, the concept is extended to a 4-channel multiplexing metasurface, operating at 15 GHz and capable of generating QPV waves. Finally, experimental results from the fabricated metasurface demonstrate the generation of QPV waves with OAM mode numbers 0, +2, +1, and −1, achieving simulated and measured OAM mode purities of 0.835 and 0.70, respectively. The experimental data closely aligns with simulations, confirming the effectiveness of the design.

Traditional methods often encounter issues such as low computational efficiency and insufficient accuracy. To address above problems, this article proposes the hybrid finite-difference time-domain (H-FDTD) method based on the Drude two critical points (Drude2CPs) model. The H-FDTD algorithm introduced encompasses the alternating direction implicit finite difference time domain (ADI-FDTD) method and the dispersive contour path finite difference time domain method based on Drude2CP (DCP-FDTD-D2CP). The ADI-FDTD for non-dispersive case leads to an elevation in computational efficiency. The DCP-FDTD-D2CP algorithm is specifically applicable to the dispersion scenario occurring at the interface between metal and dielectric. In this context, the frequency-dependent formulae employ the trapezoidal recursive convolution (TRC) technique. In addition, the rigorous analysis shows that the proposed H-FDTD algorithm is theoretically stable. To validate its efficacy, a series of numerical examples was carried out, specifically involving metal circular waveguides and slotted coaxial lines. The obtained results indicate that the relative error of this method is maintained below 1%, and the computational efficiency is enhanced by 60% in comparison with the traditional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm. Consequently, this method exhibits the characteristics of stability, high precision, and high efficiency. Moreover, it is convenient for simulating and analyzing complex structures.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3571528","Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province(grant numbers:LH2021E036); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201168,62201169); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3072022CFJ0802,3072023LH0803); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11015684","Alternating directions implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method;dispersive contour path finite-difference time-domain method based on Drude two critical points (DCP-FDTD-D2CP);trapezoidal recursive convolution (TRC)","Finite difference methods;Dispersion;Time-domain analysis;Accuracy;Metals;Media;Stability analysis;Shape;Convolution;Computational modeling","","","","32","IEEE","26 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Significant effort has already been devoted to improving the numerical evaluation of source integrals yielding potentials (or their derivatives), especially for triangular elements. However, numerical techniques for accurately evaluating the subsequent test integrals have been largely neglected, with simple numerical integration schemes being used that either ignore or are developed with incomplete knowledge of the detailed behavior of potentials (or their derivatives) near edges and vertices. Consequently, simple numerical quadrature schemes are found to be either of limited accuracy or slowly convergent with respect to increasing the sampling for self, edge- or vertex-adjacent source, and test triangle pairs. Here, we describe a simple model derived from static potential integrals that properly describes and bounds the potentials and their derivatives near vertices. From it, we are able to construct appropriate, separable radial-angular quadrature schemes that are both exponentially convergent and applicable to all potential forms of interest arising from both EFIE and MFIE operators. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the wide-ranging applicability and improved convergence rates of the proposed scheme, and these are compared to some previously reported testing schemes.

The conventional compressed sensing (CS)-based imaging algorithms address the problem by suspecting the sparsity of the imaging space, showing good reconstruction performance but failing to tackle the imaging tasks in weakly sparse scenes. Besides, traditional iterative imaging algorithms also suffer from high computational complexity, cumbersome parameter tuning, and poor adaptability. To address these issues, a novel unsupervised 3D SAR image reconstruction network is proposed for estimating 3D SAR images from the corresponding incomplete echo measurements. The proposed scheme contains two stages. Wherein, the first stage aims to estimate the missing echo elements from the incomplete observations by designing a generative adversary network based on partial convolution-based generative adversarial network (PCGAN). The second phase focuses on reconstructing the target synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image from the estimated echoes by constructing an unsupervised adaptive fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA)-inspired deep unfolding network (AdaFIST-Net). Finally, simulations and real-measured experiments are carried out. Experimental results show that the proposed imaging network outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms in reconstructing 3-D images from sparsely sampled echoes in various sampling conditions and SNR cases.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3547742","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271108,62401119,62371104); National Research Foundation, Singapore, and Infocomm Media Development Authority under its Future Communications Research and Development Program(grant numbers:FCP-NUS-RG-2022-018); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2024T170104,2024M760354); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10919030","3-D imaging;compressed sensing (CS);deep unfolding;generative adversarial learning;millimeter-wave (mmWave) imaging;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);unsupervised learning","Imaging;Radar polarimetry;Three-dimensional displays;Radar imaging;Image reconstruction;Signal processing algorithms;Synthetic aperture radar;Sensors;Millimeter wave communication;Sparse matrices","","","","36","IEEE","10 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with the traditional 1-D estimation methods, the proposed method in this article can achieve effective prediction in both scalar and vector domains. Specifically, the vector domain is derived from the point clouds of the model. The surface current can be approximated using a uniformly convergent bivariate Chebyshev polynomial. In previous studies, the Chebyshev polynomial has often been replaced by the Maehly approximation (a rational polynomial) to extend the prediction range. However, due to the singularity of the coefficient matrix and the lack of certain coefficients, this substitution does not always result in increased accuracy. Consequently, the classical Chebyshev polynomial approach is adopted to enhance the stability and accuracy of the results. Additionally, the coefficient matrix is calculated using circular indexing, thereby optimizing the algorithmic framework further. The derivative calculations are not involved in the proposed method.

Rather than engineering the dispersion of each MTS cell locally, we harness the emerging near-field interactions (evanescent waves) between the scatterers to realize anomalous reflection at a fixed angle over a wide frequency range. Three anomalous reflectors are designed and experimentally verified at 10 GHz, demonstrating high-performance metrics compared to traditional achromatic reflectors while employing simple, low-profile unit cells.

This study concluded that, when applied to overhead wire (OHW) detection in obstacle collision avoidance system (OCAS) for flying vehicles (FVs), multistatic radar cross section (RCS) from a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar system seems to be a way to achieve that goal. Monostatic and multistatic RCSs are derived, highlighting the advantages of multistatic RCS. A complex envelope of signals received at individual antenna active elements as a function of aspect angle is determined from a multistatic RCS scenario. The stretch processing for complex range profiles from signals received by a radar after illuminating a target is examined. The 2-D range aspect angle intensity (RAAI) maps based on stretch processing using monostatic and multistatic RCS of perfect electric conductor (PEC) OHW and circular cylinder (CC) cable obstacles are generated. Multistatic RCS improvements relative to the normal incidence are in the order of 1.5, 6, and 7 dB for the PEC CC cable physical optics (P.O.) theoretical model, the Feko PEC twisted wire, and the Feko PEC CC cable, respectively. Multistatic RCS exhibits superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) detection differential over all aspect angles, in the order greater than 18 dB for simulation cases, and in the order of 15 dB for experimental cases analyzed in this study; hence, the multistatic RCS is more suitable for low observable obstacles’ detection, e.g., the detection of OHW obstacles for FVs’ OCAS. Detection behavior from both our experimental measurement collections using a TIDEP-01012 radar and simulation results agree.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3548129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10931805","Bistatic radar cross section (RCS);flying vehicles (FVs);monostatic RCS;multistatic RCS;obstacle collision avoidance system (OCAS);perfect electric conductor (PEC) overhead wire (OHW) RCS;range aspect angle intensity (RAAI) map;stretch processing range profile","Radar;Radar cross-sections;Radar antennas;MIMO radar;Helicopters;Wire;Collision avoidance;Radar detection;Laser radar;Receiving antennas","","","","27","IEEE","18 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from existing Van Atta arrays that can only achieve retrodirective properties, this article proposes a novel array configuration. The proposed Van Atta array can simultaneously achieve self-adaptive scattering enhancement (SASE) and RCS reduction (RCSR) by a simple reconfigurable signal transmission path regulator (RSTPR). The RSTPR is realized by a reconfigurable power divider using a compact 1-bit phase shifter. In mode 1, the RSTPR appears as a crossover. In mode 2, the RSTPR is equivalent to two parallel transmission lines, allowing the signal transmission paths and phase delays in the feed network to be flexibly controlled. In the SASE state, the retrodirective characteristic is realized based on the co-polarized ports of antenna elements connected in pairs with equal-length transmission lines. While, in the RCSR state, the low observability is achieved through the orthogonal polarized ports of antenna elements connected in pairs with a 180° phase delay. It can achieve polarization conversation and phase cancellation without additionally designing cancellation subarrays. As a result, in the SASE state, the antenna array has a −6 dB beamwidth of the monostatic RCS of 74° in yoz plane at 9.6 GHz.

However, the fundamental wave-medium interaction aspects in such media, such as scattering and energy-momentum relations, have been essentially unexplored to date. In this article, we fill this gap, considering three dynamic systems: moving-matter blocs, moving-perturbation interfaces, and moving-perturbation truncated periodic structures, and provide corresponding general formulations along with comparisons.

In this study, by introducing a metamaterial textile (MMT) structure that incorporates antennas integrated into wearable fabrics, quasi-omnidirectional radiation from a deeply implanted device was achieved. The structure consists of a focusing antenna, a spoof surface plasmon (SSP) structure, and four radiating elements. The focus antenna receives electromagnetic (EM) energy emitted by the deeply implanted device to excite the basic radiation mode of the patches via the SPP waveguide. Therefore, EM energy radiates in all directions, avoiding unnecessary harm to the human body. The entire system, including the deeply implanted antennas and metamaterial structure incorporating the antennas, operates in the 2.45-GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band.

Consequently, the transmission distance and rate of the backhaul link based on OAM are severely limited. On the other hand, in the upcoming beyond fifth-generation (B5G) mobile communications and sixth-generation (6G) mobile communications, the demand for communication distance between the macro base station (BS) and the self-backhaul small cell (SBSC) ranges from hundreds of meters to several kilometers, and the demand for transmission rate ranges between 100 Gb/s and 1 Tbps. The OAM beam generated by the uniform circular array (UCA) exhibits inverted cone divergence. The difference in divergence angle between different modes can be two times or even more than three times. This makes it impossible to achieve long-distance and high-speed transmission simultaneously. In order to construct a 1-km and Tbps OAM transmission system, this article proposes a symmetric OAM transmission scheme using cassegrain antennas (CAs). The CAs can converge the OAM beams and achieve high antenna gain. When the antennas are strictly coaxially aligned, backhaul links supporting a 1-km transmission distance and a 1-Tbps transmission rate are constructed. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the backhaul link transmission scheme using symmetric CAs is verified through mathematical models, simulations, and experiments.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3553394","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62250070); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10942481","Backhaul link;cassegrain antenna (CA);orbital angular momentum (OAM);transmission system","Backhaul networks;Transmitting antennas;Dipole antennas;Mobile communication;Convergence;Antenna feeds;Reflector antennas;Data communication;MIMO;Computer architecture","","","","38","IEEE","26 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address the lack of spatial degree of freedom (DoF) to further enhance the capacity of THz ISLs, orbital angular momentum (OAM) is introduced, which realizes orthogonal signal transmission in the mode domain. However, the satellite perturbation caused by the oblateness of the Earth, called the  $J_{2}$  effect, leads to beam deviation, which induces undesired OAM mode transition and results in interchannel interference (ICI). In this article, a deterministic channel model for OAM-based THz ISLs considering  $J_{2}$  perturbation is proposed. Specifically, an analytical solution of the relative motion equation (RME) of satellite pairs is derived to precisely characterize the beam deviation induced by  $J_{2}$  perturbation. Then, the OAM mode decomposition is derived for deviated THz OAM beams, based on which the intended signals and interference signals are modeled. By incorporating the  $J_{2}$  perturbation characterization into the OAM mode decomposition, the interference power and capacity of OAM-based THz ISL can be determined. For OAM-based THz ISLs, simulation results indicate that: 1) the capacity first increases and then decreases with growing deviation; 2) with proper deviation (~1.5 km), the implementation of OAM can provide double or higher peak capacity compared to THz ISLs without OAM; 3) with significant deviation (>3 km), a larger receiver aperture decreases the capacity; and 4) the proper radius of the receiver aperture is 0.5 m and satellite pairs should calibrate after 180 min at 600 km operating in dual-OAM mode multiplexing to restrict deviation and ensure high data rates.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3551609","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:W2512007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10937999","Intersatellite communications;orbital angular momentum (OAM);terahertz (THz) communications","Terahertz communications;Perturbation methods;Receivers;Satellites;Apertures;Interference;Channel models;Indexes;Electric fields;Orbits","","","","28","IEEE","25 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This communication proposes a reconfigurable 1-bit fixed-frequency beam-scanning array using a long microstrip line as the excitation source and phase shifters simultaneously, leading to the merits of ultra-thin thickness and small cross section. The reconfigurable 1-bit unit consists of two symmetric open cavities. Two rows of p-i-n diodes are located between the radiating elements and microstrip line to obtain 1-bit quantized phases (0°/180°). The isotropic array is simulated using MATLAB to obtain an appropriate unit spacing of 16 mm at 5 GHz. A 16-unit reconfigurable 1-bit beam-scanning array at 5 GHz is fabricated. The results indicate that the proposed reconfigurable 1-bit array achieves a scanning range of 92° from −43° to 49° with the maximum peak gain of 10.7 dBi and a scan loss of only 2.2 dB. All the cross-polarized levels are better than 13 dB and the average sidelobe is 5.6 dB. Benefiting from the use of the microstrip line without extra phase shifter, the width of the antenna array is less than  $\lambda _{0}$  and the profile is only  $0.04\lambda _{0}$ .

To address this, a planar-cavity-complementary-dipole (PCCD) antenna is investigated. The antenna incorporates two pairs of differential ports, enabling both dual linear polarization (LP) and circular polarization (CP). Enhanced low-elevation radiation in E and H planes is, respectively, achieved through strategically constructed electric (E) vertical currents and E current loops, while four in-phase equivalent magnetic (M) currents and a horizontal E current element complement the broadside radiation. The planar cavity is induced as a radiator to support low-elevation radiation. Comprehensive analyses cover the identification of co- and cross-polarization radiation elements, the establishment of spatial phase relationships, pattern multiplication, and the influence of antenna height and image effects on radiation characteristics. The antenna achieves HPBWs exceeding 236° in the E-plane, 153° in the H-plane, and 180° for CP across a bandwidth of 11.1%, with a 3-dB axial ratio (AR) BW surpassing 155° throughout the band. Wide-beam characteristics are well-preserved in a fabricated 4-by-4 phased array antenna (PAA), with an average of 130° HPBWs in active element patterns (AEPs). The array demonstrates gain fluctuations of 2.5 and 3.5 dB across scanning ranges of ±65° for dual-LP and ±55° for CP, respectively, achieving broadside gains of 14.4 dBi/dBic.

Compared to the prior synthesis techniques for multilayer FSS and 3-D FSS, the proposed synthesis technique demonstrates a high level of consistency between simulated results and theoretical predictions, in addition to size compactness.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3547617","University of Macau Special(grant numbers:CPG2024-00014-FST); Macau Science and Technology Development Fund (FDCT) Research(grant numbers:0080/2021/A2,0075/2023/RIA2); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) through General Program(grant numbers:61571468,61971475); Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:001/2024/SKL); State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (University of Macau) Open Research Project(grant numbers:SKL-IoTSC(UM)/ORP04/2025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10919068","Coupled narrow aperture;frequency-selective surface (FSS);shielded patch resonator;synthesis design","Apertures;Resonators;Impedance;Integrated circuit modeling;Stripline;Substrates;Topology;Band-pass filters;Antennas and propagation;Transmission line matrix methods","","","","19","IEEE","10 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna is composed of a Rotman lens beamformer, a slotted waveguide array (SWA), and a mechanical sweeping phase gradient metasurface (PGM). The Rotman lens and the PGM together provide a wide range of scanning angles, enabling 2-D beam steering. To improve the crossover level (COL) and the sidelobe level (SLL) of the beams steered by the Rotman lens, the technology of dual sources excitation (DSE) is used, optimizing the COL and the SLL by the tapered magnitude distribution from the sources. Numerical analysis and full-wave simulation are used to verify the performance variations with different source aperture sizes. Since the SWA array can generate a quasi-plane wave above its aperture, the PGM can be fitted close to the SWAs with low spillover loss, resulting in a low antenna profile ( $\lt 0.41\lambda $ ). Then, the phase distributions of the PGM are optimized to suppress the edge negative phase mutation, further optimizing the gain and SLL. To verify the feasibility, a prototype is designed and fabricated at 5.8 GHz. The measured results show that ±50° and ±40° beam scanning ranges in the multibeam and PGM mechanical sweeping planes are realized with the minimum COL and SLL of −2.6 and −8.8 dB. With the wide angle 2-D beam scanning range, low SLL, and COL, the proposed antenna would be attractive for low-cost sensing and communication applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3553748","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62401450); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (CPSF)(grant numbers:2024M752580); Technology Innovation Guidance Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2024QCYKXJ-177); Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF(grant numbers:GZB20230565); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10944223","Multibeam antenna;phase gradient metasurface (PGM);quasi-optical beamformer;Rotman lens","Lenses;Antennas;Transmission line matrix methods;Aperture antennas;Topology;Metasurfaces;Butler matrices;Power transmission lines;Phased arrays;Training","","","","17","IEEE","27 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method involves creating an additional transmission bridge between the apertures of the two antenna elements at the feeding layer, effectively canceling the mutual coupling at the center frequency. The transmission bridge comprises two key components, which are a coupling structure connecting the aperture to a fork-shaped branch line, and a cancellation circuit. Notably, the cancellation circuit boasts wideband magnitude and phase compensation capabilities, providing a broadband decoupling response. Furthermore, it does not require any additional impedance-matching structures. To demonstrate the effectiveness, a  $1\times 2$  co-polarized patch antenna array operating at 5.0 GHz was designed, fabricated, and tested. The measured port-to-port isolation of the array exceeded 50 dB, with a fractional bandwidth of 14.0%. Despite the use of lossy resistors, the insertion loss is less than 0.88 dB. These results underscore the advantages of the proposed coupling cancellation method, which offers a wide bandwidth, a low profile, and a straightforward design process.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3556281","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62471500); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundations(grant numbers:2023A1515011412); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities Sun Yat-sen University(grant numbers:24QNPY131); Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC)(grant numbers:AoE/E-101/23-N); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10949727","Aperture coupled antenna;co-polarization;decoupling;full duplex;patch antenna","Antenna arrays;Mutual coupling;Couplings;Interference cancellation;Patch antennas;Antennas;Dipole antennas;Wideband;Antenna feeds;Slot lines","","","","16","IEEE","4 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the active feed section, high-power direct up-conversion active transmitter circuits are utilized alongside higher-order mode dielectric resonator (DR) antennas to significantly enhance the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) while facilitating communication functions. The passive transmitarray section incorporates a novel concept of power-combining transmitarray, overcoming the conventional limitations of two-way power combining and feed spacing being less than half the wavelength. This technique enables watt-level output while maintaining the low cost and high integration.
