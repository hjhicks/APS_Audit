A transmission line model is also presented to better explain the soft surface operation.

To address this gap, we propose a theoretical framework aimed at emphasizing the maximum number of independent MIMO channels that an antenna can provide in a cell and compare it with the physical upper bounds, and the latter is provided by the degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the field in the same cell. This approach allows for the definition of novel figures of merit for the quantification of antenna array performance, and the individuation of design strategies targeting the maximization of the number of independent channels, the average efficiency, and the maximum average gain within a specific cell. By exploring the DoF of the electromagnetic (EM) field, we establish the physical upper bounds for system performance. To this end, this article details the embedded element patterns (EEPs), their related efficiency correlation matrix (ECM) and cell correlation matrix (CCM), and orthogonal field modes, discussing the practical implications of these concepts for MIMO systems.

However, conventional rectennas suffer from limited power harvesting area and significant dependence on sensor node orientation and location relative to the transmitter. This article presents a novel planar multisector mirror rectenna array designed for efficient and uniform microwave power transfer to wirelessly charge IoT sensor nodes. The proposed system addresses limited power harvesting challenges by integrating four endfire rectifying antennas (EFRAs) elements surrounding a centrally located bore-sight rectifying antenna (BSRA) element on both sides of the array like a mirror, ensuring orientation-insensitive coverage in both azimuth and elevation planes. The design facilitates direct conjugate matching of the antenna and rectifier circuit, minimizing insertion losses and enabling a compact, fully integrated form factor. This configuration provides isotropic coverage, making it ideal for RF wave-constrained IoT environments. Simulation results indicate that the system achieves a notable RF-dc conversion efficiency, with the maximum efficiency for the two-series combined EFRA elements observed at 64% (measured 60.5%) and a complete system efficiency of 55% at  $2240~\Omega $  and 44.76% at  $2482~\Omega $  for  $\theta =90^{\circ } $  and  $\phi =0^{\circ } $  planes, respectively. The space-diverse rectenna system (SDRS) can harvest approximately 1600 mV of open dc voltage, sufficient to recharge and operate low-power IoT sensor nodes. The experimental setup validated these results, demonstrating the system’s potential as a robust solution for wireless power transfer (WPT) in smart environments.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3542971","Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science and Technology, Government of India(grant numbers:CRG/2022/007257); Department of Telecommunication, Government of India(grant numbers:TTDF/6G/80); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10906349","Angular misalignment;Internet-of-Things (IoT);multisector rectenna;orientation tolerant;radiation patterns;rectenna array;wireless sensor nodes","Rectennas;Radio frequency;Energy harvesting;Internet of Things;Schottky diodes;Rectifiers;Antenna radiation patterns;Inductors;Current density;Voltage","","","","46","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike the previous shared-aperture array schemes that focus on reducing coupling between low-band (LB) and high-band (HB) antennas to address unwanted cross-band interferences, this array introduces a special tightly coupled buffering layer (TCBL) that is tightly coupled with both LB and HB radiators. The TCBL serves as a buffer, facilitating the radiation of both LB and HB antennas while mitigating cross-band interferences without requiring extra filtering/frequency-selective measures. It plays two crucial roles. In the LB, the TCBL functions as a reactance-compensation loading that enables a significantly low profile of the LB antenna. This leads to a reduced LB scattering influence on the HB antenna, realizing restored HB radiation performance. In the HB, the TCBL enables a new resonant mode that further expands the HB bandwidth from 45.5% to 59.0%. Meanwhile, the array effectuates effective cross-band isolation, as the TCBL prevents the electromagnetic energy from transferring to the cross-band ports.

A filtering antenna is proposed, employing a C-HMFSIW cavity for feeding and a slot-loaded C-FSIW cavity for radiation.

To further enhance bandwidth and frequency selectivity, a new antenna configuration is developed using a C-HMFSIW cavity for feeding and a slot-loaded T-FSIW cavity for radiation. After loading the radiation slot, the T-FSIW cavity serves as two parts: one as the main radiator and the other as a parasitic radiator opposite to it. This configuration increases antenna bandwidth and generates an additional RN. Interestingly, adjusting the position of the radiation slot allows the RN to switch between the upper and lower stopbands.

Among these applications, rotating permanent magnet antenna (RPMA) stands out due to its compact size, low-power consumption, high efficiency, and strong radiation intensity. Meanwhile, its omnidirectional characteristic leads the antenna with broad signal coverage. However, this omnidirectionality may lead to signal interference and increasing bit error rates when multiple RPMAs transmit signal simultaneously, which will reduce communication performance. Meanwhile, current researches mainly focus on enhancing RPMA’s radiation intensity with insufficient in-depth discussion on directionality. To meet the demand of directionality in different scenarios, this work proposes a directional pattern reconfigurable antenna based on RPMA array. The influence of factors such as the number of elements, spacing, distribution, and phase on the directional characteristics of the magnetic field intensity generated by RPMA arrays is comprehensively considered, and the antenna’s directivity can be enhanced 2.67 times. Through experimentation with a designed three-element RPMA array, this work demonstrates the reconfigurability of directional characteristics and validates the communication robustness. By simple positional adjustments and phase control, the directionality can be changed flexibly between omnidirectional and directional characteristics.

The correct diagnosis of these errors has been a challenge in radio astronomy. The most widely used technique is microwave holography, in which mechanical errors are detected through long electromagnetic acquisitions. The measured far-field is processed to obtain the aperture field, thus the errors affecting the surface or the phase distribution.

The element is composed of two back-to-back dual-polarized (DP) ME dipoles and a transition structure. The geometric phase is related to the element rotation angle, and the propagation phase is controlled by the transition structure. Based on the hybrid phase compensation technique, the left-hand CP (LHCP)/right-hand CP (RHPC) waves from the ME dipole feed can be independently manipulated by the TA and reradiated out with the opposite handedness through two separated channels.

Second, the OL also functions as the DRA to achieve unidirectional radiation excited by a novel lateral differential feeding network, maintaining an unobstructed optical path by the DRA’s ground-free design. Finally, the LA and DRA radiate scanning beams alongside the OL, enabled by the adaptive front-lighting system (AFS), thereby eliminating the need for an extra EM beam-scanning mechanism. This helps to reduce the system’s complexity and cost. To verify the concept, a ground-free unidirectional DRA and a 3D-printed millimeter wave (mmWave) beam-scanning LA are integrated with the OL in a vehicle’s headlight. The DRA achieves a front-to-back ratio (FBR) of 13.73 dB, operating at 2.7 GHz with a gain of 3.26 dBi. The LA achieves the maximum gain of 16.64 dBi, operating at 26 GHz with a beam coverage of ±20°, which can be further extended by the AFS. When adjusting the headlight by the AFS, the LA and DRA maintain the optimum communication range, enhancing the vehicle’s situational awareness during interactions with other vehicles and infrastructures. This article presents a viable solution for in-vehicle antenna integration for C-V2X applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3532085","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171301); State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves(grant numbers:K2022322); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10856780","3-D printing;beam scanning;cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X);in-vehicle antenna;transparent antenna;unidirectional dielectric resonant antenna (DRA)","Antennas;Dielectrics;Lenses;Vehicle-to-everything;Antenna feeds;Optical reflection;Optical beams;Millimeter wave communication;Adaptive arrays;Transmitting antennas","","","","35","IEEE","28 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fully polarized waves are generated by the superposition of two orthogonal linearly polarized waves. With the amplitude and phase of the two orthogonally polarized ports precisely controlled by active chips, the fully polarized beam-scanning capability is achieved. The theoretical formulation of full-polarization beam-scanning synthesis of this architecture is derived.

To achieve wideband operation, four resonant characteristic modes are excited in a compact T-shaped cavity with a rectangular slot aperture. The interaction of these four modes is shown to create fictitious shorts along the length of the slot that results in multiple resonances. Characteristic mode analysis (CMA) and optimization are used to place four such fictitious short modes at the right frequencies in order to cover a fractional bandwidth of 40%, which is shown to be close to the theoretical bandwidth limit of a single slot with broadside radiation.

Unlike previous works, the relationship between mutual coupling and in-band scattering is investigated, identifying that the coupling structure is one of the primary contributors to residual mode scattering. Taking advantage of this feature, the bridge circuit topology is employed to analyze the effects of unbalanced adjustments for the coupling structure, revealing that these adjustments will lead to polarization conversion of the scattered field from co-polarized to cross-polarized form. Subsequently, a p-i-n diode-based central branch with interpolarization coupling current control ability is introduced for the real-time control of the trade-off between scattering and radiation performance. As a result, a dual-polarized element and its mirror element co-designed with controllable scattering polarization conversion ability are proposed, enabling residual mode scattering cancellation when arrayed together. As a demonstration, a prototype is fabricated and measured, which is capable of operating from 7.6 to 12 GHz with a radiation beam scanning up to ±60° in E-/H-plane. The achieved in-band co-polarized monostatic radar cross section reduction (RCSR) averages 16.5 and 21.4 dB for H-/V-polarized incidence, respectively.

The sparsity technology was first extended into the optimization of the arrangement of wideband-connected array components. By virtue of adjusting the width of the edge radiation wall, an optimal radiation distribution of a wideband array can be implemented, which also exploits more freedom of element distribution and characteristic design. Moreover, the advantage is that the connectivity between wideband antenna units and the continuity among array current distribution can be ensured. Though the optimized array layout can accomplish lower sidelobe level (SLL) with equal-amplitude excitation feed, it may also exacerbate the complexity of the mutual coupling (MC), which further affects the radiation characteristics such as bandwidth, voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), and wide-angle scanning. Hence, the space mapping (SM) technique was introduced to accomplish the wideband irregular optimal design involving the MC effects for higher optimizing efficiency and accuracy. The genetic algorithm (GA) was incorporated with active element pattern (AEP) to further optimize the irregular array distribution for the coarse model of the SM design procedure, which involves the actual array element rather than the only array factor synthesis. A prototype array was made and measured, and the experimental results showed that the design results were in good agreement with the measurement results.

Our curl-conforming bases for the pyramid are tangentially continuous with those of adjacent differently shaped cells of the same order and type (i.e., hierarchical or interpolatory) available for years in the literature. This allows numerical electromagnetic solvers using zero-order vector basis functions to be transformed into higher order solvers that work with hybrid meshes simply by adding a few routines to compute the multiplicative polynomials and their first derivatives. Hierarchical bases, including ours of previous articles, are in general more convenient than interpolatory ones for using p-adaptive techniques, while the interpolatory bases such as those shown here are more easily implemented because the recurrence relations of Silvester polynomials are much simpler than those associated with hierarchical multipliers.

Due to the large size of the massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) base station (BS), it is very challenging to fulfill direct far-field (DFF) conditions in OTA tests. Conventional near-field (NF) testing methods suffer from long measurement times due to the stringent sampling requirements (e.g., NF to far-field (FF) transformation) or the requirement for expensive test equipment [e.g., compact antenna test range (CATR)]. In this article, we propose a simplified extrapolation technique (ET) strategy to reconstruct the FF radiation pattern based on mid-field (MF) phaseless measurements, with high measurement efficiency. The traditional ET uses polynomials with many terms to fit the radiated power of an arbitrary antenna at the radial direction, while the simplified ET only uses a few terms to fit the power variation in the MF, taking into account the structure and element excitation characteristics of common arrays such as BSs. The relationship between the element excitation mode and the coefficients of each fitted term is determined by detailed theoretical derivations. Then, the best-fitting polynomials are determined for different excitation modes. The antenna pattern of the BS is successfully reconstructed in an anechoic chamber by power measurements at two or three different distances of less than one-fourth of the FF distance. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method are experimentally verified by comparing the accuracy of the antenna pattern reconstruction with different fitting polynomials in the anechoic chamber for a practical BS antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3542615","Start-up Research Fund of Southeast University(grant numbers:RF1028623309); Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University(grant numbers:2025A05); Metrology for Emerging Wireless Standard (MEWS) of European Partnership on Metrology project Metrology(grant numbers:21NRM03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10902005","Antenna measurement;extrapolation technique (ET);massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) base station (BS);near-field (NF) antenna measurement;over-the-air (OTA) testing","Antenna measurements;Polynomials;Extrapolation;Gain measurement;Antenna radiation patterns;Testing;Directive antennas;Accuracy;Reflector antennas;Power measurement","","","","25","IEEE","24 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While active solutions, i.e., wireless sharing of a real-time location between air traffic participants and control units, are of use, developing additional security layers is appealing. Among various surveillance systems, radars offer distinct advantages by operating effectively in harsh weather conditions and providing high-resolution reliable detection overextended ranges. However, contrary to traditional airborne targets, small drones and copters pose a significant problem for radar systems due to their relatively small radar cross sections (RCSs). Here, we propose an efficient approach to label drones by attaching passive resonant scatterers to their rotor blades. While blades themselves generate micro-Doppler rotor-specific signatures, those are typically hard to capture at large distances owing to small signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in radar echoes. Furthermore, drones from the same vendor are indistinguishable by their micro-Doppler signatures. Here, we demonstrate that equipping the blades with multiple resonant scatterers not only extends the drone detection range but also assigns it a unique micro-Doppler encoded identifier. By extrapolating the results of our laboratory and outdoor experiments to real high-grade radar surveillance systems, we estimate that the clear-sky identification range for a small drone is approximately 3–5 km, whereas it would be barely detectable at 1000 m if not labeled. This performance places the proposed passive system on par with its active counterparts, offering the clear benefits of reliability and resistance to jamming.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3540278","Tel Aviv University’s (TAU) Team through the Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research Global (ONRG)(grant numbers:N6290921-1-2038); Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(grant numbers:1115/23); Israel Innovation Authority; Riga Technical University’s (RTU) Team through the Latvian Council of Science, Project LIGTHNESS(grant numbers:lzp-2024/1-0253); IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society Fellowship Program (2023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10890908","Drone identification;machine learning;micro-Doppler signature;sticker labeling","Drones;Radar;Radar cross-sections;Blades;Doppler radar;Airborne radar;Reliability;Radar detection;Bandwidth;Resonant frequency","","2","","77","IEEE","14 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is centered around a recurrent neural network (RNN) optimized through Bayesian optimization (BO). The RNN architecture includes—among others—a feature input layer, a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer, and a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) layer. BO is employed to fine-tune the network’s hyperparameters, such as the number of units in each layer and the learning rate. The LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM layers are designed to capture frequency-wise dependencies in antenna responses. A distinctive feature of this approach is the utilization of frequency as a sequential parameter processed by the RNN, which enhances reliability and cost efficiency. These advantages are further bolstered by dimensionality reduction techniques based on rapid global sensitivity analysis. The proposed method has undergone extensive validation across four antennas and has been compared against several benchmark methods, including kernel-based regression models and various neural networks. The results demonstrate that our surrogates achieve outstanding accuracy, significantly surpassing the benchmark, and can construct reliable metamodels even with low-cardinality training datasets.

In this way, we can determine the reliability of the technique and can aim to improve this. In measurement techniques where both the amplitude and phase are important, statistics should be applied not only to the magnitude, but also to the phase. Linear statistics has several disadvantages when applied to the phase. Most importantly, the computed mean is dependent on the chosen branch cut position and the computed confidence interval is not completely accurate, even if the computed mean is correct. Although circular statistics does not have these issues, it is, to the best of our knowledge, not yet used in antenna measurements, except for channel sounding. In this article, methods known in circular statistics to compute the mean and deviation are explained, along with some circular distribution functions. The effects are shown in two case studies for a planar near-field (NF) measurement and a phase pattern measurement. Furthermore, a methodology is constructed by the steps that should be taken to compute the expanded uncertainty of the phase. Using circular distribution functions, this can be computed more accurately at the cost of a higher computation time.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3542277","Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) Microelectronics and Communication Technologies Microelectronics and Communication Technologies (MoCoMa) Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10899751","Antenna measurements;circular statistics;directive statistics;measurement uncertainty;near-field (NF);phase","Antenna measurements;Phase measurement;Noise measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Phased arrays;Uncertainty;Standards;Directive antennas;Probes;Electric variables measurement","","","","21","CCBY","21 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we propose a polarization-state modulation system based on carrier-wave reflections from a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), where a sequence of data bits is mapped to polarization states. We consider a system with an upper millimeter-wave or low-terahertz (THz) RF source so that the channel model is line-of-sight-dominant. The data symbol constellation consists of 16 quaternion-valued symbols, of which two correspond to linear polarizations and the remaining 12 represent elliptical polarizations. Our channel models consist of both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and impulse noise. We utilize the Weiszfeld algorithm and generalized M-estimators (GM-estimators) to handle the impulse noise and robustly decode the polarization-space modulated (PSM) signals. Furthermore, we train and evaluate quaternion neural networks (QNNs) for decoding PSM signals using seven different activation methods.

In recent years, there has been extensive research on physical layer security (PLS) as a potential alternative to conventional security methods that rely on network complexity. The fundamental concept of PLS is to maximize the randomness of undesired channels. The high design degrees of freedom (DoFs) provided by 4-D antenna arrays make them an excellent platform for achieving secure transmission at the physical layer. However, due to the limited DoFs of time modulation, it is often challenging to balance transmission security and the number of legitimate users. The multiuser scenarios have a broader scope in practical applications. Therefore, the scalability challenges in accommodating multiple users significantly restrict the utilization of 4-D antenna arrays in PLS transmission. To address this issue, this article proposes a multiuser secure transmission approach based on 4-D antenna arrays. This approach combines baseband and time modulation, enabling simultaneous multiuser secure transmission through pseudorandom time modulation (PRTM).

Subsequently, the field distribution conditions requisite for achieving optimal PTE in the HFL-based RWPT system are derived. Guided by these conditions, a mirror-symmetric RWPT system comprising a pair of improved HFLs is designed to achieve optimal PTE under practical feeding conditions. The improved HFL consists of a redesigned HFL and a transition layer. The transition layer not only mitigates the impedance mismatch at the interface but also achieves a time-reversal symmetric field distribution required for optimal PTE. The redesigned HFL undergoes axial compression and refractive index distribution modification, thereby reducing the lens’s refractive index while maintaining its profile height. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed design, a midrange RWPT prototype based on the improved HFL is designed and fabricated. The experimental results show that the RWPT system based on the improved HFL can achieve a PTE of 41% at a transfer distance of  $d=8\lambda $  when fed by a horn antenna, demonstrating a 70% PTE improvement compared to the RWPT system based on the conventional HFL.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3538219","Chinese Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:62201541); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10879293","Impedance mismatch;improved half-fisheye lens (HFL);optimal power transfer efficiency (PTE);refractive index distribution;time-reversal symmetry;wireless power transfer (WPT)","Lenses;Refractive index;Transmitters;Impedance;Receivers;Horn antennas;Wireless power transfer;Training;Reflection;Magnetic fields","","","","41","IEEE","11 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, by co-design and including air vias (AVs) for the surface-wave aperture, the structure becomes semi-transparent and can be positioned on top of solar panels, and this can improve solar power harvesting capabilities. Structure excitation is made possible by a leaky T-junction dual-feeder using substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technology, creating a uniform wavefront that propagates through a truncated parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) section. In addition, a matching section based on an array of subwavelength printed patches is also included at the interface between the PPW and the grounded dielectric slab (GDS), while the AV section is positioned between the GDS and air region to improve antenna radiation. These features allow for an efficient and compact aperture, and findings are competitive compared to other relevant structures. For instance, the measured prototype demonstrated a peak realized gain (RG) of 17.5 dBi at 18.6 GHz, as well as high radiation efficiency and sidelobe levels (SSLs) of about −10 dB.

The parameter retrieval of nonlinear media is an important problem for nonlinear optics. However, the maturity and accuracy of nonlinear media retrieval methods lag behind that of ordinary linear media retrieval methods because it is difficult to analytically solve the Maxwell equations containing nonlinear media. Various approximations and simplifications have to be made in order to derive the analytical formulas for nonlinear parameter retrievals. Since the material’s electromagnetic (EM) parameter retrieval problem belongs to the EM inverse scattering problem, the accuracy of nonlinear media parameter retrievals can be improved if EM inverse scattering techniques, which are full-wave numerical methods, can be employed. Conventionally, EM inverse scattering methods work for linear media. In this communication, we generalize the distorted Born iterative method (DBIM), which is a popular EM inverse scattering method for linear media, to the second-order nonlinear media case. The numerical tests show that the nonlinear parameter distribution of a 1-D problem can be determined with the generalized DBIM.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3547624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10919135","Distorted Born iterative method (DBIM);inverse problem;inverse scattering;nonlinear medium;undepleted-pump approximation","Media;Inverse problems;Nonlinear optics;Tensors;Scattering;Harmonic analysis;Antennas and propagation;Predistortion;Optical distortion;Nonlinear optical devices","","","","41","IEEE","10 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, additional short-circuited strips are incorporated between adjacent metal plates to produce angle-dependent transmission zeros (TZs), thus enhancing the angular selectivity. Subsequently, to achieve dual polarization, a polarization-decoupling method is proposed that integrates an ASS valid only for TE polarization into a TM-valid PPW-based structure. The TE-valid ASS functions as a second-order spatial filter, which utilizes the dispersion of dielectric transmission lines (DTLs) to manipulate its angular responses. Finally, the TE- and TM-valid ASSs are co-designed and one dual-polarized ASS is resulted accordingly. The proposed ASS exhibits angular selectivity over a wide frequency band from 6.5 to 9 GHz, with a low profile of  $0.65\lambda_{\mathrm {C}}$  (25 mm).

The proposed dual-band mode-modulated leaky wave antenna (LWA) consists of modified substrate-integrated coaxial lines and microstrip lines based on the SSPPs transmission line (TL). The strong dispersion effect of SSPPs allows the LWA not only to satisfy the −1st harmonic radiation in the low band, but also to realize the −2nd harmonic radiation in the high band. Because two discontinuities of each mode-modulation period form a pair of reflected waves naturally that can cancel each other, the proposed LWA can suppress the open-stopband (OSB) effect in two bands simultaneously with the rare dual-band continuous beam-scanning capability. Besides, the slow wave effect of the SSPPs counteracts the gradual increase in radiated energy with the frequency of the LWA, resulting in more stable leaky wave radiation. Experiment results confirm that the proposed DB-LWA can realize −81° to 42° and −44° to 5° continuous beam scanning in two bands (7–12.8 and 14–16.1 GHz), respectively, with the gain stability of 0.13 and 0.19, respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2025.3544924","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62401133,62071117,62288101); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:111-2-05); Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professor; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20230192); Science and Technology Research Funds of Wuxi TaihuLight Program(grant numbers:K20231007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10909265","Dual-band antenna;leaky wave antenna (LWA);open-stopband (OSB);spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs)","Harmonic analysis;Modulation;Dispersion;Dual band;Periodic structures;Antennas;Metals;Frequency modulation;Surface plasmon polaritons;High frequency","","2","","26","IEEE","4 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
