A rectangular slotted parallel-plate antenna panel capable of radiating dual polarization over the same physical aperture was selected for this purpose. The design procedure, which provides for an optimal antenna pattern in a SAR application, is described. A meta-heuristic multiobjective optimization algorithm was applied to synthesize an appropriate far-field pattern, which enhances the quality of the SAR image. Subsequently, the optimization results were used to build a more realistic model of the antenna panel in electromagnetic simulation software. An antenna panel was fabricated, and its electrical characteristics were measured. The fabricated prototype weighed 1310 g and measurements showed nearly 50% aperture efficiency for both circular polarizations [34.6-dBic right-hand circular polarized (RHCP), 34.5-dBic left-hand circular polarized (LHCP), and peak gain at 9.65 GHz], with low side-lobes. A beam shift of 2.1° was observed between the RHCP and LHCP beams at the design center frequency and was later analyzed to be the result of an error in the modeling of the adhesive layer.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2676760","Institute of Space and Astronautical Science/Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; ImPACT Program of the Council for Science, Technology, and Innovation, Cabinet Office, Government of Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7867759","Linear antenna arrays;optimization;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR);slot antennas","Antenna arrays;Slot antennas;Electromagnetic waveguides;Optimization;Antenna feeds;Aperture antennas","","18","","45","IEEE","1 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both of them are put into a cylindrical container fabricated by 3-D printing technology and excited by a single coaxial probe. The inner glass DRA is excited in its broadside HEM $_{\mathrm {11\delta }}$  mode when the ethyl acetate is pumped out, while the conical TM $_{\mathrm {01\delta }}$  mode is excited in the reconstituted cylindrical DRA when the ethyl acetate is pumped in.

"Theory of Impedance Loaded Loop Antennas and Nanorings From RF to Optical Wavelengths","A. F. McKinley","Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, U.K.",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"3 May 2017","2017","65","5","2276","2281","The analytical theory of perfectly conducting thin-wire closed-loop antennas with multiple loads in the periphery was formally derived in the 1950s and 1960s. In this paper, it is extended to loop antennas and nanorings for use in communications, in the “Internet of things,” and as metamaterials. The new derivation relies on recent work from 2013 that incorporates the surface impedance of metal wires into the standard theory, thus pushing its applicability into the gigahertz, terahertz, and optical regimes. Surface impedance effects cause losses and phase shifts in the current within the loop, which in turn cause wavelength scaling and degradation of signal strength. These effects are modeled using a critical point transition model of permittivity and of the index of refraction.

Since previous studies address antenna design collecting more ambient RF power, the improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) has emerged in a scattered way, because the theoretical limit of PCE has not yet been characterized, and the optimal rectenna structure approaching such maximum PCE is still uninvestigated. In this paper, we characterize the performance limit of rectennas with input power ranging from -20 to 0 dBm, proposing optimal rectenna design demonstrating the maximum PCE. The maximum achievable PCE is cast into a mathematical programming problem. Solving this optimization model clarifies the effect of design factors, including operational frequencies, rectifier topologies, and parameterization. To achieve the maximum PCE, our investigation shows that the optimal rectenna structure should not only optimize those design factors but also eliminate the matching circuit between an antenna and a rectifier for ultralow-power scenarios. The resultant PCE at 2.45 GHz is 61.4% and 31.8% at -5 and -15 dBm, respectively, closely approaching the theoretical bound.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2682228","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 105-2221-E-027-016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7878548","Energy harvesting;impedance matching;optimization methods;power transmission;rectennas;rectifiers","Rectifiers;Rectennas;Radio frequency;Energy harvesting;Pins;Broadband antennas;Optimization","","119","","71","IEEE","14 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main body is formed by three sequentially rotationally arranged bent planar inverted-F antenna elements, which helps dramatically reduce the size of the antenna. To drive the main body, a new compact feeding network based on spiral-shaped Wilkinson power divider is also developed, achieving three-way power splitting and 120° phase shifting.

Hence, this paper proposes a multiobjective amplitude and phase optimization technique with two objective functions: PSL minimization and directivity maximization, in order to improve the beampattern. A novel selective Euclidean distance approach in the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to steer the candidate solutions toward a better solution. Results obtained by the proposed NSGA with selective distance (NSGA-SD) are compared with the single-objective PSL optimization performed using both GA and particle swarm optimization. The proposed multiobjective NSGA provides up to 40% improvement in PSL reduction and 50% improvement in directivity maximization and up to 10% increased performance compared to the legacy NSGA-II. The analysis of the optimization method when considering mutual coupling between the nodes shows that this improvement is valid when the inter-node Euclidean separations are large.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2684187","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia(grant numbers:4F290); Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(grant numbers:07085); H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015(grant numbers:690750); Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia(grant numbers:4J210,4F818,12H35); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7880558","Beampattern optimization;collaborative beamforming;directivity;distributed beamforming;multiobjective optimization;nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II);peak sidelobe level (PSL)","Array signal processing;Collaboration;Optimization;Receivers;Genetic algorithms;Antennas;Minimization","","70","","28","IEEE","17 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One layer acts as an enhanced inductor while the other layer provides capacitance. The interconnection between the adjacent array elements changes the equivalent circuit and produces a strong cross-layer capacitance, which lowers the resonant frequency significantly. The dimensions of the miniaturized FSS element are much smaller than the wavelength at the resonant frequency (periodicity ≪ λ). The element can also have a low profile since the cross-layer capacitance is stronger with a thinner substrate. The sensitivity to the incident angle of the proposed structure is comparable with traditional ones.

The presented metasurface designs employ varying phase gradient along the circumferential direction of the involved cylinder so that effective retroreflection can be achieved through redirecting the scattering dispersed by the conducting cylinder back to the direction from which the plane electromagnetic wave is coming. Supported by a grounded thin substrate with a relatively high dielectric constant, a modified loop array with compact unit cell is used to implement the nonuniformly or uniformly sampled phase gradient of the metasurface. It is observed that the metasurface-coated elliptic and circular cylinders can generate backscattering very close to that by corresponding flat conducting plates with their main planes perpendicular to the incident wave vector, for both transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations.

The metasurface is considered as a periodic planar array with electrically small dipolar scatterers.

All required interaction coefficients for the most general analysis of metasurfaces are analytically derived. The expressions in terms of the polarization currents are presented for the reflected/transmitted fields from metasurfaces at oblique illumination. Although theoretically known that adding normal polarization currents to the tangential ones will not provide extra degrees of freedom in the manipulation of the reflection and transmission properties of metasurfaces, in most practical applications, it is required to consider both tangential as well as normal polarization currents. Thus, the effect of oblique illumination in the modification of normal and tangential polarization currents is clarified.

A new concept of knitting the loop-type FSS elements in 2.5-D is proposed, where successive segments of the loop are placed alternately on the two surfaces of the substrate and then interconnected through vias. A 2.5-D square-loop FSS (2.5-D SL-FSS) based on the proposed method is designed with the inclusion of ten vias at each side and characterized by a full-wave simulator. The transmission curves indicate a significant size reduction with a figure-of-merit λ0/p = 16, where λ0 is the free-space wavelength of resonant frequency and p is the periodicity of unit element. In addition, the frequency response of this miniaturized FSS is also stable for various incident angles and polarizations. Furthermore, a general equivalent circuit model (ECM) is developed for 2.5-D SL-FSS by combining the prevailing electrical models of planar square loop and through-silicon vias. A wide set of parametric simulations for various element sizes, substrate thicknesses, and via counts are carried out with this ECM. Then, its performance is assessed on the basis of root-mean-square error (RMSE) criteria by comparing the results with appropriate electromagnetic simulations. The findings suggest that the ECM has sufficient accuracy for estimating the resonant frequency of 2.5-D SL-FSS with the RMSE values close to 3%. Moreover, the proposed concept of knitting is further validated by measuring two physical prototypes of the 2.5-D SL-FSS and the experimental results show a good consistency with full-wave simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2673809","Jiangsu Industry-University-Research Cooperative Innovation(grant numbers:BY2014003-10); Nanjing Industry-University-Research Cooperative Innovation(grant numbers:NBG0030113-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7862736","Equivalent circuit model (ECM);frequency selective surfaces (FSSs);measurement;miniaturization;printed circuit board;spatial filter;square loop;through-silicon vias (TSVs)","Frequency selective surfaces;Substrates;Integrated circuit modeling;Resonant frequency;Inductance;Capacitance;Conductors","","66","","26","IEEE","23 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The test method is based on using power spectrum analysis to characterize the degree of shielding due to the different mechanisms of reflection and absorption. The tested samples are in the shape of anechoic chambers pyramidal cones, to provide gradual impedance gradient. Slabs with flat surface are also built and tested in order to compare the results.

However, a global and static p-refinement will increase the computational cost significantly. In this paper, a dynamic p-adaptation algorithm is proposed based on the discontinuous Galerkin time-domain method, which is able to determine and adjust the basis order in a given discretization element in real time of the simulation. Based on the relation between the nodal and modal approximations defined on unstructured tetrahedral elements, an error estimator, which is very cheap to compute, is developed to determine the proper basis order to achieve a desired numerical accuracy. The dynamic p-adaptation algorithm proposed in this paper is able to capture the fast varying physics by changing the order of basis functions wherever and whenever needed.

However, advantages of the reported approaches are tempered by their lack of generality and severely degraded performance on poorly shaped elements, the latter caused primarily by the parametric transformations' severe distortion of the kernel's circularly concentric level contours. Here, for coplanar element pairs and kernels with 1/R singularities, we apply the surface divergence theorem twice to obtain a novel formula for 4-D reaction integrals, generalizing earlier schemes while retaining their benefits and without distorting the original configuration space.

This is numerically advantageous because the discretization of the transversal component of the scattered fields, electric (TE) or magnetic (TM), becomes free from hypersingular Kernel contributions. In the analysis of composite objects, though, the imposition of the continuity requirement around junction nodes, where the boundaries of several regions intersect, becomes especially awkward. In this paper, we present, for the scattering analysis of composite objects, a new combined discretization of the Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) integral equation, for homogeneous dielectric regions, and the electric-field integral equation, for PEC regions, such that the basis functions are defined strictly on each segment, with no continuity constraint between adjacent segments. We show the improved observed accuracy with the proposed TE-PMCHWT implementation on several dielectric objects with sharp edges and corners and moderate or high contrasts.

To solve zero-thickness Huygens' metasurface problems for general broadband excitations, the double-Lorentz dispersion profile is combined with GSTCs, leading to a set of first-order differential fields equations in time domain. Identifying the exact equivalence between Huygens' metasurfaces and coupled RLC oscillator circuits, the field equations are then subsequently solved using standard circuit modeling techniques based on a finite-difference formulation. Several examples, including generalized refraction, are shown to illustrate the temporal evolution of scattered fields from the Huygens' metasurface under plane-wave normal incidence, in both harmonic steady-state and broadband regimes. In particular, due to its inherent time-domain formulation, a significant strength of the methodology is its ability to model time-varying metasurfaces, which is demonstrated with a simple example of a pumped metasurface leading to new frequency generation and wave amplification.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2681323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875455","Electromagnetic (EM) metasurfaces;electromagnetic propagation;explicit finite difference;generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs);Lorentz dispersions","Time-domain analysis;Mathematical model;Magnetic susceptibility;Broadband antennas;Dispersion;Magnetic moments;Broadband communication","","20","","29","IEEE","10 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Coifman wavelets are employed to implement Galerkin's procedure in the method of moments (MoM). The Coiflets-based surface integral equations (IEs) consist of both the tangential and normal components of electromagnetic fields as unknowns. The inherited mathematical superiority, e.g., local multiresolution analysis and high regularity with Holder index 1.449 in smoothness, allows efficiently implementing both electric field IE and magnetic field IE. Due to the high-precision one-point quadrature, the Coiflets yield fast evaluations of the most off-diagonal entries, reducing the matrix fill effort from O(N2) to O(N). The orthogonality and Riesz basis of the Coiflets generate well-conditioned impedance matrix, with rapid convergence for the conjugate gradient solver. In addition, a semianalytical expression of the tapered-wave carried power is derived, which speeds up computations of the normalization factor of scattering coefficients. Numerical results demonstrate that the reduced PEC model does not suffer from ill-posed problems, namely, matrix condition numbers are kept small and solutions are stable under extremely large loss tangent, where normal components of H-field and tangential E-field have vanished. Compared with the previous publications and laboratory measurements, good agreement is observed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2679768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7874116","Coifman wavelets;random rough surface;scattering;surface integral equations (IEs)","Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface impedance;Surface waves;Scattering;Integral equations;Sea surface","","5","","37","IEEE","8 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper investigates how wall roughness affects radio propagation in tunnels, and presents a unified ray tracing and modal method for modeling radio propagation in tunnels with rough walls. First, general analytical formulas for modeling the influence of the wall roughness are derived, based on the modal method and the ray tracing method, respectively. Second, the equivalence of the ray tracing and modal methods in the presence of wall roughnesses is mathematically proved, by showing that the ray tracing-based analytical formula can converge to the modal-based formula through the Poisson summation formula.

The effects of frequency, sea depth, seafloor conductivity, and receiver height on the fields are discussed. An experiment was conducted on shallow sea, and the test results agree well with theoretical predication in the quasi-near range. A transmission distance over 3 km above the sea surface was realized with reasonable transmitting power, which shows the potential of our theoretical model for applications in shallow sea environment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2681320","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601374); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3102015ZY014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875504","Electromagnetic (EM) waves;horizontal electric dipole (HED);shallow sea;Sommerfeld integral (SI);three-layer model","Atmospheric modeling;Silicon;Dipole antennas;Sea surface;Receivers;Media","","14","","16","IEEE","10 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The characteristics of the proposed element are first analyzed and then a linear and smooth phase response covering about 600° is obtained by adjusting the length of the PDL. Based on the element cell, an offset-fed reflectarray antenna of an octagon-shaped aperture with 266 mm in diameter is designed, fabricated, and measured to verify the broadband property of the proposed element. The measurement results show that about 31.5% of 1-dB gain bandwidth is realized, and the maximum gain at the center frequency of 10 GHz is about 25.78 dBi, which is equivalent to about 50% aperture efficiency.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2679493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7874081","Broadband;phase-delay lines (PDLs);reflectarray antenna;single-layer","Broadband antennas;Reflector antennas;Bandwidth;Broadband communication;Antenna measurements;Apertures;Feeds","","67","","12","IEEE","8 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this regard, the EM performance analysis of an ogival radome based on novel graded dielectric inhomogeneous wall structure is presented. The radome wall considered here consists of seven dielectric layers cascaded in such a way that the middle layer has maximum dielectric parameters (dielectric constant and electric loss tangent) and on either side, dielectric parameters of the layers decrease in a graded (or stepwise) manner. Further, the outer surface of the radome wall is coated with an antistatic and antierosion radome paint. The EM performance parameters of the radome enclosing an X-band slotted waveguide planar array antenna (center frequency: 10 GHz; bandwidth: 1 GHz) are computed based on 3-D ray tracing in conjunction with aperture integration method. The study shows that the proposed graded dielectric inhomogeneous streamlined radome is an excellent choice for airborne applications as compared to airborne radomes based on conventional constant thickness radome designs and variable thickness radome (VTR) designs.

A novel technique is introduced to design a synthetic resonator in which two loop-shaped resonators intersect to each other resulting a unique resonator operating at two frequencies. The proposed design has the advantages of separating two very closely spaced frequency bands as in GSM systems with a narrow notch between the two frequencies of 1842 and 2142 MHz. Furthermore, a very low-frequency response sensitivity to the oblique incidence angles is achieved by using a miniaturized single synthetic resonator for the two frequencies in a single layer. Good agreement is observed between the measured and simulated results. A minimum of 20-dB attenuation for the transmission coefficient is achieved in all downlink frequency ranges of GSM system with a good stability against the oblique angle of incidence for both transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polarizations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2670230","TÜBİTAK(grant numbers:113E619); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857769","Arrays;bandstop filters;frequency selective surface (FSS);resonators;triple band","Resonant frequency;Frequency selective surfaces;GSM;Geometry;Current distribution;Couplings;Tuning","","58","","13","IEEE","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The corner-like intersections of the cylinders with the substrate and superstrate are addressed with particular care, by intricately locating properly modulated fictitious sources, so that the rapid spatial variations of the fields can be effectively modeled. The spurious-free modal analysis scheme is sped up with an efficient serial mode-tracking scheme, which is based on the physical perturbation theory. The respective software tool is robust to the choice of materials, geometric parameters, and wavelength. Sample results are presented for circular and triangle-like cylinders.

If the location of a reflection point is known, it can be treated, and thus the level of the extraneous signal can be reduced or even completely mitigated. The combining mode rotation with CLEAN (CMRCLEAN) algorithm has shown that it is capable of detecting the AoA of closely spaced reflective sources, even in the presence of a strong signal such as the main beam illuminating the QZ.
