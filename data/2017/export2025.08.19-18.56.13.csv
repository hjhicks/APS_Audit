It synthesizes identical far-field radiation patterns as a conventional single-feed square loop antenna. The dual-feed antenna (DFA) also simplifies or even eliminates the lossy power-combining network between the transmitter and antenna, achieving direct on-antenna power combining. The proposed antenna concept significantly improves the total radiated power and power efficiency of a wireless transmitter, particularly useful for 5G transmitters that normally require large output power to compensate the high mm-Wave path loss. Compared with antenna-array-based spatial power combining, the DFA only requires a single-antenna footprint and maintains the single-element beamwidth, ideal for mobile 5G communications. The dual-feed square loop antenna is designed and characterized at two potential 5G bands, i.e., 38.5 and 73.5 GHz. Conventional single-feed square loop antennas are implemented as reference designs. Closely matched antenna characteristics are achieved in measurement between the proposed DFA and conventional single-feed antenna. The dual-feed square loop antenna has measured broadside gain of 2.9 and 3 dBi, and fractional bandwidth of 13% and 14%, at 38.5 and 73.5 GHz, respectively. High-speed modulation test is also performed. A 4.3% error vector magnitude (EVM) with a -33.2-dBc adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) for 6-Gb/s 64QAM is achieved at 38.5 GHz, and a 5.6% EVM with a -33.4-dBc ACLR for 6-Gb/s 64QAM is measured at 73.5 GHz, which demonstrates the viability of the proposed DFA for high-speed and complex modulations required by 5G communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2723920","Intel Corporation through Intel gift funding; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7970140","5G communications;antenna;millimeter wave;multifeed antenna (MFA);power combining;quadrature amplitude modulation","Impedance;5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Antenna measurements;Antenna radiation patterns;Transmitters","","56","","34","IEEE","6 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Three subarrays switch their beams to three distinct regions. Each subarray works as a phased array to steer the beam within each region. Large coverage efficiency is achieved. (e.g., 80% of the space sphere has the realized gain of over 8 dBi.) The proposed antenna covers a bandwidth of over 2 GHz in the band of 28 GHz.

In talk mode, good directivity and beam switching can be realized by placing the switchable array at the top of the chassis (close to the index finger). And the user shadowing can be significantly reduced by placing it at the bottom of the chassis (close to the palm).

Local area measurements using cluster and route scenarios show how the received signal changes as the mobile moves and transitions from LOS to NLOS locations, with reasonably stationary signal levels within clusters. Wideband mmWave power levels are shown to fade from 0.4 dB/ms to 40 dB/s, depending on travel speed and surroundings.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2734159","NYU WIRELESS Industrial Affiliates Program; NSF(grant numbers:1320472,1302336,1555332); Nokia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7999256","Channel transition;diffraction;human blockage;millimeter wave (mmWave);mobile propagation;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);propagation;small-scale fading;spatial autocorrelation;spatial consistency","Diffraction;Antenna measurements;Frequency measurement;Predictive models;Loss measurement;Mobile communication;Power measurement","","131","","76","OAPA","1 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that due to the sparsity of millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels, any variation in spatial parameters can dramatically affect the sum rate. In microwave scenarios, where the probability of line-of-sight (LOS) propagation is low, the structure of the eigenvalues is highly dependent on the richness of scattering. In mmWave bands, where the probability of LOS is higher, the structure of the eigenvalues is largely dependent on the LOS channel model. The uniform linear array is seen to have a superior sum rate and an eigenvalue structure due to the inherently larger interelement spacings and wider azimuth spectra. These observations are seen to affect the sum rate, EDOF, and massive MIMO convergence. Two variations of channel connectivity are then considered, and compared with EDOF, to examine the richness of scattering and channel rank.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2759958","China Important National Science and Technology Specific Projects(grant numbers:2013ZX03003009); National Key Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2012BAF14B01); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61171105,61101079); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:NCET-11-0598); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8058454","Channel models;fifth generation (5G);massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO);millimeter-wave (mmWave)","Antenna measurements;Microwave antennas;Frequency measurement;3GPP;Antenna arrays;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Microwave measurement","","39","","45","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper investigates how the user affects the performance of a 5G handset mock-up. The user impact is studied by channel sounding in an indoor scenario, with and without the presence of different users. The mock-up handset has a uniform linear array of receive (Rx) antennas operated at 21.5 GHz. A dual-polarized horn antenna with a wide beamwidth is transmit antenna and a fast channel sounder is used, allowing for dynamic and realistic channels. The results show that the mean influence of the user on the power varies considerably depending on the scenario, with more than 12 dB loss in some cases, while a gain of 4 dB is seen in other. An important finding is that the mean power among the seven Rx branches may be very different.

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation through a wall or around hallway corners exhibits approximately 5-20 dB (11 dB on average) greater loss beyond the 20 dB aperture loss at 24 GHz compared to that at 2.55 GHz.

With this array configuration, the channel matrix is always a circulant matrix regardless of antenna type, array radius, Tx-Rx distance, and rotation about the coaxis. Due to the characteristics of a circulant matrix, the channel matrix can be diagonalized independently of the above-mentioned factors by fixed-weight beamforming based on a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix uniquely determined by just the number of antennas. In this paper, the operating principle of the proposed technique is discussed from the viewpoints of linear algebra, and some example network configurations are presented with the determination of the DFT-matrix weight. Numerical analyses confirm the two important features of the proposed technique: 1) support of more than 4×4 SR-MIMO and 2) independence with regard to rotation about the coaxis.

Next, we compared the Shannon capacity with the achievable bit rate (ABR), using ZF for seven-user MIMO transmissions with 100 elements at the BS.

Our analysis focuses on the comparison of patch antennas versus dipoles, representative for the antennas typically used in massive MIMO experiments today. Through simulations and measurements, we show that the finite patch array has a lower gain pattern variation compared with a dipole array. The impact of a large gain pattern variation on the massive MIMO system is that not all antennas contribute equally for all users, and the effective number of antennas seen for a single user is reduced. We show that the effect of this at system level is a decreased rate for all users for the zero-forcing MIMO detector, up to 20% for the patch array and 35% for the dipole array.

One of the challenges in effectively implementing an advanced precoding scheme to a large-scale array antenna is how to reduce the mutual coupling among antenna elements. In this paper, a new concept that is called array-antenna decoupling surface (ADS) for reducing the mutual coupling between antenna elements in a large-scale array antenna is proposed for the first time. An ADS is a thin surface that is composed of a plurality of electrical small metal patches and is placed in front of the array antenna. The partially diffracted waves from the ADS can be controlled to cancel the unwanted coupled waves. Two practical design examples are given to illustrate the design process and considerations, and to demonstrate the usefulness of ADS for the applications of phased array antennas and M-MIMO systems when commonly used precoding schemes are applied. The attractive features of ADS include its applicability to a large-scale array antenna; suitability for a wide range of antenna forms; wide decoupling bandwidth; and simplicity in implementation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2712818","Postgraduate Scholarship of The Chinese University of Hong Kong; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942017","Decoupling;decoupling surface;large-scale array antenna;massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO);mutual coupling;phased array","Mutual coupling;Phased arrays;Reflector antennas;MIMO;Metals","","338","","20","IEEE","7 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the multimode decoupling technology remains a great challenge, especially for mobile terminals. One difficulty in achieving multidecoupling modes is that the operating modes of closely packed decoupling elements have very strong mutual effect, which makes the tuning complicated and even unfeasible. Thus, in physical principle, a novel idea of achieving the stability of the boundary conditions of decoupling elements is proposed to solve the mutual effect problem; in physical structure, a metal boundary is adopted to realize the stability. One distinguished feature of the proposed technique is that the independent tuning characteristic can be maintained even if the number of decoupling elements increases. Therefore, wideband/multiband high isolation can be achieved by using multidecoupling elements. To validate the concept, two case studies are given. In a quad-mode decoupling design, the isolation is enhanced from 12.7 to >21 dB within 22% bandwidth by using a 0.295λ0 × 0.059λ0 × 0.007λ0 decoupling structure.

Four simultaneous beams using digital beamforming approach are also presented for the 16 × 16 array for multiuser environment base station antenna applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2748239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8024015","Cavity backed;cross printed dipoles;digital beamforming approach;multiple beams","Cavity resonators;Antenna arrays;Dipole antennas;MIMO;Antenna measurements;Antenna radiation patterns","","57","","17","IEEE","1 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
