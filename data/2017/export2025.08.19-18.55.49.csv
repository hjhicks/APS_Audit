It consists of a scatterer and the resistor to be detected. The scatterer is designed to be V-shaped. The angle θ between two arms is used to encode the address data of sensor. The resistor to be detected is loaded in the middle of the two V-shaped arms. The sensor is excited by the plane wave. By measuring the scattered fields in two orthogonal polarization directions, the angle θ and the value of resistor can be identified. Compared with the normal resistancetype sensor, the novel sensor can transform the resistance value and its address into the wireless signal which can be received directly by the reader. Another advantage of angle-based sensor is that every element can encode multibit data. This is helpful to achieve higher capacity. Also, for different codes of one element, the proposed sensor uses the same spectrum. This is beneficial to improve the efficiency of the spectrum.

For the lower band, the design utilizes a center-fed patch with shorting rods at its edges, forcing the patch to radiate as an equivalent magnetic-current loop. For the upper band, another magnetic current loop is created by adding four symmetrical resonant slots on the patch, which radiates almost independently of the shorted patch. To allow coverage of a larger bandwidth, two sets of varactor diodes are used to independently control the resonance frequencies of the two bands. As a validation of the proposed concept, two antenna prototypes, with and without reconfigurabilities, have been optimized and fabricated. Measurement results show that the low-profile reconfigurable monopolar antenna achieves two independent tunable bands, with -10-dB-tuning ranges of 31% and 22% centered at about 0.9 and 1.7 GHz, respectively. The antenna height is only 0.020λmin, where λmin is the freespace wavelength at the minimum operating frequency.

The assessment of the antenna performance is conducted with respect to the structure size and its reflection response. More specifically, the best possible tradeoffs between these two figures of merit are identified through multiobjective optimization at the level of full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation. Analysis of Pareto-optimal designs obtained for various antenna topologies allow for their fair comparison; particularly in terms of the minimum size, they can be designed for (assuming acceptable reflection response levels) or the best attainable reflection characteristics. For the sake of computational efficiency, the multiobjective optimization algorithm utilized in this paper exploits sequential domain patching technique and variable-fidelity EM simulation models, which is a fully automated procedure that permits finding Pareto set representations at the cost corresponding to about a hundred of high-fidelity EM analyses of a given structure.

The permittivity and thickness of the dielectric sections decrease in the transverse direction. Two-step optimization method was implemented employing a customized full-wave optimizer to optimize the width and thickness of each dielectric section in the superstrate, while maintaining a fixed overall diameter of the antenna. This optimization results in an antenna with a high gain and a large 3-dB gain bandwidth, without compromising on antenna footprint.

It is the first time, to our knowledge, that a Q calculation for miniature implanted antennas is conducted. In this paper, we consider a skin-tissue implantation scenario and planar dipoles with extremely thin profile and small aperture size. Notably, antennas' physical volume does not exceed 25 mm3. Results indicate a strong dependence of resonance frequency on the antenna geometry for fixed physical size. In addition, external impedance matching proves to be inferior to integral matching via metallization in relation with antenna radiation performance (gain, efficiency, and quality of communication link). Finally, the quality factor Q of small fixed-size antennas highlights the influence of the design on the exhibited resonance and sensitivity response (impedance BW, tolerance to detuning, and gain stability).

We introduce two kinds of rectangular slots in the design to control the magnitude and phase range of transmission coefficients in the two designed frequency bands through changing the slot length.

However, faulty antenna elements in a UCA could render the array into an imperfect UCA (IUCA), consequently creating distortion for OAM-based communication or radar systems. To analyze the effects of an IUCA on generating OAM, elementary wave function and wave transformation are derived to obtain field equations of a general circular array. Further derivation of IUCA shows that the field of an IUCA is a superposition of OAM modes, which is caused by polluted orthogonalities of OAM modes. To achieve pure OAM modes, the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, the convex optimization tool, and the analytical solution are employed to design a feeding network to retrieve the orthogonal property at the cost of strong gain loss. Then, the reduced constraints method is proposed for the IUCA to achieve high-purity and low-loss OAM mode. Finally, four circular arrays with different shapes are explored for limited installation space to generate twisted beams.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2700160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7915752","Circular array;cylindrical wave transformation;elementary wave function;orbital angular momentum (OAM);twisted beams","Antenna arrays;Wave functions;Radar;Radar antennas;Distortion;Matching pursuit algorithms","","77","","26","IEEE","2 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this method, the region under transformation is divided into a few tetrahedrons, both in the physical and virtual domains. Each tetrahedron of the physical domain transforms to a tetrahedron in the virtual domain. The material properties of each tetrahedron are then calculated using the Jacobean matrix of the transformation. Since the elements of the Jacobean matrix are constant, the ε and μ tensors are finite and homogeneous in each tetrahedron. The method is verified for several rectangular waveguide coupler examples.

The proposed procedure is validated experimentally by interpolating the planar electrical near field radiated by three antennas. The quality of the interpolation and its robustness to noise are investigated. Despite its simplicity, the interpolation method is able to properly estimate the near field from a random coarse sampling of 2λ. The quality of the near-field interpolation is also confirmed by deriving the far-field. These promising results pave the way for the development of fast antenna measurement procedures.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2705163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7930477","Antenna measurements;inverse problems;sampling methods","Interpolation;Antenna measurements;Electromagnetics;Minimization;Splines (mathematics);Antennas;Transmission line matrix methods","","20","","18","IEEE","17 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The metasurface is designed according to a Surface-Circuit-Surface architecture and leverages the inherent unidirectionality of transistors for breaking time reversal symmetry. Interesting features include transmission gain as well as broad operating bandwidth and angular sector operation.

We propose a novel strategy to design high-performance dual-band transmissive meta-surfaces by using anisotropic ABBA systems (a four-layer system with identical structures in layers 1 and 4, and another group of identical structures in layers 2 and 3). The ABBA element provides a new freedom to enhance the transmission and suppress the fluctuations by tuning the coupling among cascaded layers. Dual-band operating property is performed by employing the polarization-related electromagnetic response. A well-designed transmissive meta-surface, operating at f1 = 6.5 GHz and f2 = 10.5 GHz, consists of 13 × 17 ABBA elements with parabolic phase distributions. Good focusing effects with the same focal length and small reflection are observed at both frequencies under different polarizations. For practical applications, a dual-band lens antenna (LA) is implemented by launching the meta-lens with a self-made Vivaldi antenna. Numerical and experimental results coincide well, indicating that the proposed LA is better in many aspects such as high radiation gain, comparable aperture efficiencies to other designs in literature, and having a simple fabrication process.

By augmenting the DG-EFIE with current continuity equation, the proposed scheme can alleviate the low-frequency breakdown. In the augmented system, the electric field integral equation and the current continuity equation are discretized by using hybrid basis functions including Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) and half RWG basis functions. Since the half RWG basis is not divergence conforming, line charge degrees of freedom on the adjoining edges are introduced in this paper.

The MoM matrix entries involving BFs at the same metallization level are computed in the spatial domain as double integrals, which require low-order quadrature rules. The integrands are cross correlations between BFs times multilayered periodic Green's functions (MPGFs). The cross correlations between BFs are obtained in terms of elliptic integrals of first and second kind.

The proposed method does not require any predefined gap between the antennas and the imaged object, nor does it need the imaged object to be centered within the imaging domain. Also, the method does not need to know boundaries of the imaged object. The proposed method is tested via simulations and experiments using a multistatic human torso imaging system. The collected data across the band 0.65-1.75 GHz using twelve antennas around the human torso are processed to generate accurate images.

Due to the small antenna dimensions, these feeding structures are often much bigger than the antenna under test (AUT) itself and with chip sizes of around 1 mm2, the achievable separation between antenna and feed is limited. Wafer probes have to be used to feed the AUT during passive antenna measurements and present a large reflective surface in close proximity to the AUT. Reflections from the wafer probe cause interference on the measurement surface and distort the results. The same is true for active antenna measurements, where bondwires and the package can have a significant effect on the radiated fields. The fragility and size of the components do not allow to reduce reflections with absorbers, which is why modal filtering was used in this paper to mitigate undesired reflections and improve the measurement result through postprocessing. Two issues that limit the performance of the algorithm are discussed, namely, phase center inaccuracies of the AUT and a limited measurement surface. It is shown that modal filtering is applicable to integrated antenna measurements at frequencies over 100 GHz and that a significant improvement in the measured radiation pattern can be achieved. Furthermore, it is shown that the postprocessed results make it possible to measure the directivity of integrated antennas, despite strong probe reflections.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2705225","German Research Foundation(grant numbers:WA 3506/1-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7930455","Antenna measurement;integrated antenna;mathematical absorber reflection suppression (MARS);millimeter-wave;modal filtering;phase center;spherical wave expansion (SWE);wafer probe","Antenna measurements;Manganese;Probes;Antenna feeds;Phase measurement;Distortion measurement","","18","","24","IEEE","17 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
