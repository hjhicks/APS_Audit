The antenna is fabricated based on the bulk silicon microelectromechanical systems micromachining technology. This micromachining process can etch silicon wafers and plate them with gold. Because all surfaces of the proposed antenna are plated with gold, electromagnetic waves can transmit in the air medium without any other dielectric. The air-filled structure contributes to achieving a leaky-wave slot antenna with fixed beam as operating frequency varies. A prototype of the proposed antenna is fabricated to verify the design strategy. The measured results show that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna is 55-67 GHz and within the operating frequency band, the main beam direction only varies from 48° to 53°, which confirms the fixed-beam characteristic.

The narrow meandered slot is highly reactive and it is instrumental for scaling down the tag resonant frequency. Most importantly, the narrow slot does not affect the radiation characteristics of the patch resonator much, making the resonant frequency lower. In the design, the patches are stub-shorted to ground, where two inductive thin stubs are used for frequency adjustment. A simple equivalent circuit has been derived for studying the tag impedance characteristics.

To analyze its true advantage in transmit applications, the third-order intermodulation output intercept point (OIP3) and the gain-bandwidth product of the non-Foster matched antenna have been compared with the unmatched antenna, when both are attached to the same power amplifier. Simulations show that the unmatched antenna has a higher OIP3 and gain-bandwidth product, despite being more poorly matched.

The antenna consists of an electronically reconfigurable polarizer integrated with a printed slot. By changing the states of the p-i-n diodes on the polarizer, the linearly polarized (LP) waves radiated by the slot can be converted into either right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) or left-hand CP (LHCP) waves. The polarizer contains 16 unit cells arranged as a  $4\times 4$  array. The antenna radiates RHCP waves if the p-i-n diodes on the top side of the polarizer are switched ON, while LHCP waves are radiated if the p-i-n diodes of the bottom side of the polarizer are switched ON instead. The physical mechanisms of the antenna are discussed and the parametric study is carried out by full-wave simulations. To verify the concept, one prototype at 2.5 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured. Good agreement between the measured and simulated results is obtained. The antenna achieves a gain ≥8.5 dBic in both RHCP and LHCP with an aperture efficiency of 70%. Advantages of the proposed design include electronically reconfigurable polarizations for RHCP or LHCP, low profile, low cost, high isolation between the dc bias circuit and RF signals, high power handling capability, and easy extension to large-scale arrays without increasing the complexity of the dc bias circuit.

It consists of two 4×4 subarrays operating at 3G (1710-2170 MHz) and long term evolution (2490-2690 MHz) bands. For size miniaturization, the elements of the two 4 × 4 subarrays are interleaved with each other. The mutual coupling between the elements operating at different bands is suppressed by using filtering antennas with out-of-band radiation suppression. And the spacing between them can be decreased, resulting in array miniaturization. To obtain stable two-beam radiation patterns within the two operating bands, the beam-forming networks with little magnitude and phase imbalances are specially designed for each band. For demonstration, the proposed 4 × 8 array is implemented. In the measurement, the array exhibits stable 10-dB beamwidth around 120° in the azimuth plane within the two entire bands. As a result, the two-beam radiation patterns satisfy the coverage requirement of 120° in the azimuth plane for base-station applications. Additionally, 16.4 dBi/15.5 dBi peak gains and around -10 dB cross levels at the junction of two beams are achieved within the two operating bands.

By designing suitable time sequences of a 4-D heterogeneous array with uniform static amplitude excitations, the original synthesis problem is simplified into two independent small problems, which can be easily solved in two steps, respectively. In the first step, the approach takes definite advantages from the convexity of the problem with respect to the static phase excitations and the switch-on duration times. These optimization variables become known and are fixed in the second step. Then, the DE algorithm is used to optimize the switch-on time instants. Owing to the efficiency of the CP, only 2/3 of the optimization variables need be solved in the first step, while even fewer number of optimization variables are solved in the second step. Consequently, the joint optimization of CP and DE algorithm significantly improves the overall synthesis efficiency. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2725379","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631006,61571101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7973165","4-D heterogeneous antenna arrays;convex programming (CP);differential evolution (DE) algorithm","Optimization;Manganese;Switches;Algorithm design and analysis;Amplitude modulation;Planar arrays","","28","","38","IEEE","11 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed structure features a number of unique propagation properties. First of all, the inductance value imposed along the transverse direction will affect the phase velocity and cutoff frequency of the waveguide simultaneously. Second, the inductance value in the longitudinal propagating direction will only affect the phase velocity but make no difference on the cutoff frequency. Based on the aforementioned characteristics, the size of structure could be controlled by separately tuning the loaded inductor along the transverse direction and longitudinal propagating direction. More importantly, it is released on the interrelationship between the phase velocity and cutoff frequency in the proposed guiding-wave structure.

The proposed methodology bypasses some of the most significant challenges associated with waveguide simulation. In particular, the WGF approach handles spatially infinite dielectric waveguide structures without recourse to absorbing boundary conditions, it facilitates proper treatment of complex geometries, and it seamlessly incorporates the open-waveguide character and associated radiation conditions inherent in the problem under consideration.

For this FSS structure, the filtering responses for different polarizations and resonance frequencies are realized through separate subcells. For example, to achieve a single-band bandpass performance, two subcells, acting as parallel LC resonators for transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polarizations, respectively, are implemented by MLIs and PPCs. Because the MLIs and PPCs provide increased equivalent inductance and capacitance, respectively, this FSS provides a miniaturized unit cell size of λ0/20(λ0 refers to the resonance wavelength), and its -3 dB bandwidth can be designed by independently adjusting the equivalent inductance and capacitance. A design example shows the easy control of -3 dB bandwidth ranging from 13.6% to 49% with respect to the center frequency. Furthermore, because of the separable subcells, the FSS performances for different polarizations are independently controllable, and it can be readily extended to achieve dual-band bandpass performance with a band ratio ranging from 1.35 to 3.8. In addition, to model the FSS frequency performance precisely, equivalent circuits and closed forms are developed, which serve as a substitute for commercial software for efficient FSS design. Finally, some prototypes are fabricated and measured. All the measured results show that the proposed FSS designs exhibit stable performance under different polarizations and incidence angles (up to 60°), and they exhibit good consistency with those from the full-wave simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2729158","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401230); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7987801","Equivalent circuit;frequency selective surfaces (FSSs);miniaturized element;separable inductors and capacitors","Frequency selective surfaces;Inductors;Capacitors;Equivalent circuits;Resonant frequency;Circuit topology;Integrated circuit modeling","","28","","37","IEEE","21 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, this approach can drastically decrease the number of unknowns and lower the requirements of PC's memory. Especially for periodic structures, computational efficiency will be improved sharply since synthetic functions defined on different subblocks can be set identical and the process of constructing synthetic functions needs to be calculated only once. However, for nonperiodic structures, this advantage no longer exists due to the diversities of synthetic functions defined on different subblocks. In that case, synthetic functions need to be calculated block by block. Targeted at this problem, an improved SBFM is proposed for nonperiodic scaling structures whose subblocks only share identical/similar contour features, but spatial attitudes, spatial positions, and geometrical sizes can be arbitrary. Based on theoretical analysis, the improved SBFM employs a special triangulating method for each subblock which makes synthetic functions defined on them reusable. In this way, synthetic functions need to be calculated only once too for nonperiodic scaling structures. Compared to traditional SBFM, this approach decreases the elapsed time of constructing synthetic functions and memory cost of synthetic functions' expansion coefficients to 1/N (N is the number of subblocks) and is of great help in the analysis of large scale targets such as complex nonperiodic arrays. Finally, accuracy of this approach is validated by both simulating and measured results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2723661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7971934","Method of moment (MoM);nonperiodic scaling structures;scattering analysis;synthetic basis functions","Method of moments;Mathematical model;Lead;Scattering;Integral equations;Periodic structures;Impedance","","11","","21","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the TD-EFIE can only be formulated with the surface electric current by using the thin dielectric sheet approach. Since the spatial unknowns are only assigned to the surface of the conductor, the computational resources can be saved significantly. Besides, the analytical solution can be obtained for the convolution of the medium susceptibility and the divergence of surface electric current.

In this paper, we focused on the characteristics of diffuse scattering in X-band, and conducted the MIMO channel measurements in indoor environments in the 11-GHz band. The frequency, angular, and polarization domain dense multipath component (DMC) propagation parameters were jointly estimated by using the RiMAX-based estimator. The measurement result showed the existence of significant DMC, which is thought to have originated from the floor, the ceiling as well as the walls. The angular spreads of the DMC tended to increase, and their decay factor tended to decrease as the room size decreased. It is also shown that the existence of DMC significantly affected the eigenvalue structure of the MIMO channel, which defines the MIMO transmission performance.

At first, an accurate analysis is presented aimed at the evaluation of the channel matrix by comprehensively including also the effects of the antenna in LOS condition. In particular, the channel matrix has been calculated as a function of the antenna parameters and orientation, demonstrating that CP radiators are capable of obtaining better average values of the matrix eigenvalues with respect to LP ones.

In this paper, we propose novel modifications to the existing DoA algorithms and show how these can be adapted for real-time DoA estimation using two-port composite right/ left-handed (CRLH) reconfigurable leaky-wave antennas (LWAs). First, we propose a single/two-port multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm and derive the corresponding steering vector for reconfigurable LWAs. We also present a power pattern cross correlation algorithm that is based on finding the maximum correlation between the measured radiation patterns and the received powers. For all algorithms, we show how to simultaneously use both ports of the two-port LWA in order to improve the DoA estimation accuracy and, at the same time, reduce the scanning time for the arriving signals. Moreover, we formulate the Cramer-Rao bound for MUSIC-based DoA estimation with LWAs and present an extensive performance evaluation of MUSIC algorithm based on numerical simulations. In addition, these results are compared to DoA estimation with conventional AAs. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in an indoor multipath wireless environment with both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS components. Our results demonstrate that DoA estimation of the received signal can be successfully performed using the two-port CRLH-LWA, even in the presence of severe multipath.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2724584","VTT Technical Research Center of Finland and the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation within the framework of the Reconfigurable Antenna-Based Enhancement of Dynamic Spectrum Access Algorithms project; Doctoral Program of the President of Tampere University of Technology; Academy of Finland(grant numbers:288670); U.S. National Science Foundation as part of the Wireless Innovation between Finland and United States partnership(grant numbers:CNS-1147838); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7979544","Cramer–Rao bound (CRB);directional antennas;direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation;leaky-wave antennas (LWAs);measurements;multiple signal classification (MUSIC)","Antenna arrays;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Multiple signal classification;Antenna measurements;Directive antennas","","36","","45","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The power-delay profile (PDP) characterizes the propagation channel by simple statistics. In this communication, we propose a channel model to simulate a given wideband averaged PDP obtained by measurements or theoretical considerations, enabling to test, develop, and design radio links. The channel model is based on a geometrical stochastic approach, allowing to simulate the space-variant channel impulse response for a moving receiver. Furthermore, the appearance and disappearance of multipath components are geometrically taken into account by an angular pattern. We verify the proposed methodology by simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2722864","DLR Internal Project Navigation 4.0; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7967773","Broadband communication;communication channels;communication systems;electromagnetic propagation;frequency-selective fading channels;microwave propagation;mobile communication;multipath channels;radio communication;radio navigation;radio propagation;radio wave propagation;time-varying channels;wireless communication","Receivers;Channel models;Delays;Antennas;Navigation;Probability density function;Stochastic processes","","6","","27","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such a context, we aim at characterizing the channel from both a temporal and an angular perspective by exploiting a 2D CLEAN-like technique to extrapolate the multipath components and a K-means algorithm for clustering, where centroids statistics depend on the environment contour. The obtained channel model can be exploited for mapping algorithms based on backscattered radar measurements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2728088","IF-EF Marie-Curie Project MAPS(grant numbers:659067); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7982802","Backscattering;channel model;millimeter-wave","Radar;Radar antennas;Antenna arrays;Backscatter;Delays;Channel models;Frequency measurement","","27","","22","IEEE","17 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A thin flexible metal wire is used to fabricate the antenna, which can run along with the shoelace without destroying the shoe or adding extra big structures. According to the investigations, to put the feeding probe at the bottom of the cross point is better than the locations around the string bowknot. To make the shoelace tighter or looser will influence the performance with an affordable variation. The effect of the biological tissues has been taken into account during the performance evaluation of the antenna. The measured fractional bandwidth is 11% with a resonance of 2.43 GHz in the ISM Band. The main lobe of the antenna points to the upper front direction with an angle of about 20°, which is suitable for the detecting of the anterior obstacles when walking. The measured results indicate reasonable performance for the shoelace antenna to serve as a tool for the blind person.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2722874","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61372029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7967703","Blind person guidance;collision avoidance;shoelace antenna;wearable antenna","Footwear;Collision avoidance;Metals;Wires;Antenna radiation patterns;Probes","","18","","7","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The phase information of the measured steering vector is used to derive a novel calibration matrix that is proposed to compensate for the relative phase distortion (RPD) at each antenna port. We also present a metric function defined as a standard deviation of the RPD to determine the optimum calibration angle, which provides intuition for the cause of the accuracy degradation in the direction-of-arrival estimation. To verify the feasibility, a seven-element circular array with identical microstrip patch antennas is fabricated for calibrating its array manifold using a single steering vector measured in a full anechoic chamber. The calibrated array manifold is then used to estimate the direction of arrival, and its accuracy is compared to the calibrated result obtained from the traditional least-squares method. The results demonstrate that the estimation error can be improved by 54.9° compared to the traditional least-squares method, when the number of measured steering vectors is extremely limited.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2731374","Civil Military Technology Cooperation and the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2015R1A6A1A03031833); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990229","Adaptive antenna array;antenna array;array manifold calibration;direction finding array","Calibration;Antenna measurements;Manifolds;Distortion measurement;Phase distortion;Phased arrays","","4","","30","IEEE","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
