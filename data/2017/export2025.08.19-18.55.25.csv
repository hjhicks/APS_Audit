Six rows of coupled microstrip resonators with different lengths are printed on a Teflon block. The lengths of the microstrip resonators in different rows are gradually reduced along the endfire direction. The first four rows of resonators provide four resonances at different frequencies for bandwidth enhancement. The last two rows of resonators are used as two directors to suppress sidelobe levels at high frequencies. A trapezoidal launcher is applied to serve as a reflector and provide one resonance at the lowest frequency. A trapezoid-shaped capacitive-feed strip is utilized and also printed on the Teflon block to globally optimize the wideband impedance matching. The proposed antenna covers a relative bandwidth of 109% for VSWR <; 2 with a height of 0.044λL and a volume of only 0.03λ3L (λL being the freespace wavelength at the lowest operating frequency).

Attributing to the way of differential excitation, the radiation directivity of TM11 mode in such a patch has been improved a lot, and field distributions for both TM10 and TM11 modes are found to be simultaneously excited for radiation. Next, two shorting posts are introduced to this MPA so as to generate an additional mode, i.e., zero mode, which resonates in a frequency between TM10 and TM11 modes. With the proper arrangement of these three modes in proximity to each other, a wide bandwidth for radiation can be satisfactorily achieved. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed concept, a prototype antenna is finally designed and fabricated. As theoretically expected, the impedance bandwidth of the final designed patch antenna has been increased to 50.46% and the gain is around 6.5 dBi.

"Small Antennas Remote Impedance Measurement Using Electrostatic Discharge","M. Manteghi","Electrical Engineering Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"2 Jan 2017","2017","65","1","44","51","The conventional techniques to measure the input impedance of an antenna are based on comparing the reflected signal to the incident signal at the antenna port at a given frequency. A network analyzer connected to the antenna under test through a feeding cable is the most common impedance measurement setup. The induced current on the outer surface of the feeding cable in the electrically small antenna (ESA) case, however, significantly interferes with this process. Therefore, the traditional methods to measure the input impedance such as using a network analyzer may not be suitable for an ESA. A remote impedance measurement technique based on the impulse responses of an ESA terminated to three standard loads, short/open/matched load, is introduced. Two different types of antennas are designed and simulated using a full-wave simulator and then the impulse responses are computed using a transient simulator software. Thereafter, two different circuit models are introduced and the parameters of these models are computed using three impulse responses. The input impedance of both antennas are computed directly from the full-wave simulations as well as the remote measurement technique and the results are compared. Finally, both antennas are prototyped, measured, and the input impedances of the antennas are compared for the direct measurement using a network analyzer and the proposed technique. The presented results confirm the accuracy of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2630679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748512","Circuit model;electrically small antenna (ESA);electrostatic discharge (ESD);impulse response;transient analysis","Antenna measurements;Antennas;Integrated circuit modeling;Impedance measurement;Impedance;Load modeling;RLC circuits","","7","","21","IEEE","18 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present ideas to improve the wideband isolation between closely spaced antennas. We do this by connecting lumped lossy (resistive) elements between the antenna feeds. A simple analytical expression is provided to compute the impact of resistive elements on efficiency to analyze the power lost in the resistive element. Three configurations of decoupling circuits are designed and fabricated for two closely spaced monopoles operating at 2.4 GHz. The decoupling circuit contains transmission lines of different lengths at the antenna inputs such that the mutual admittance between the antenna elements is: 1) resistive; 2) resistive and inductive; or 3) resistive and capacitive. Lumped elements are then connected between the transmission lines followed by matching circuit. This paper shows that with configurations 2) and 3), we can improve the wideband isolation compared with 1), as well as compared with using only lossless elements. The wideband isolation was improved by 17.6 dB across a 200-MHz band at 2.4 GHz, with a final isolation level of 20 dB over that band. Better than 30 dB isolation was achieved across a narrower band of 55 MHz. The proposed technique provides wideband isolation improvement for multiple-input multiple-output as well as narrowband performance with large isolation suitable for in-band full-duplex applications. The impact on efficiency is investigated to verify that the advantages from the improved wideband isolation outweigh the possible reduction in overall efficiency.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2630727","Academy of Finland, under the project (In-band Full-Duplex MIMO Transmission: A Breakthrough to High-Speed Low-Latency Mobile Networks); Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation, Tekes, under the project (Full-Duplex Cognitive Radio: Technology and Application to Cognitive M2M Communications); Aalto ELEC Doctoral School, Finland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748550","Antenna;decoupling;full-duplex (FDX);isolation;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Antenna arrays;Wideband;Admittance;MIMO;Antenna feeds;Transmission line antennas","","58","","26","IEEE","18 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Xue","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Millimeter-wave and Wideband Wireless Communications, CityU Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Millimeter-wave and Wideband Wireless Communications, CityU Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"2 Jan 2017","2017","65","1","63","70","This paper presents a novel dual polarized planar aperture antenna using the low-temperature cofired ceramics technology to realize a novel antenna-in-package for a 60-GHz CMOS differential transceiver chip. Planar aperture antenna technology ensures high gain and wide bandwidth. Differential feeding is adopted to be compatible with the chip. Dual polarization makes the antenna function as a pair of single polarized antennas but occupies much less area. The antenna is ±45° dual polarized, and each polarization acts as either a transmitting (TX) or receiving (RX) antenna. This improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the wireless channel in a point-to-point communication, because the TX/RX polarization of one antenna is naturally copolarized with the RX/TX polarization of the other antenna. A prototype of the proposed antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured, whose size is 12 mm × 12 mm × 1.128 mm (2.4λ0 × 2.4λ0 × 0.226λ0). The measurement shows that the -10 dB impedance bandwidth covers the entire 60 GHz unlicensed band (57-64 GHz) for both polarizations. Within the bandwidth, the isolation between the ports of the two polarizations is better than 26 dB, and the gain is higher than 10 dBi with a peak of around 12 dBi for both polarizations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2630723","Science Technology and Innovation Committee of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JSGG20150331154209122); Guangdong Joint Innovation Project in Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2014B050504002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748563","Antenna in package (AiP);dual polarized antenna;millimeter wave (mmWave);planar antenna","Aperture antennas;Bandwidth;Transceivers;Antenna measurements;Impedance","","82","","36","IEEE","18 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The metal casing includes the metal back cover and the metal frame around the edges thereof. For such metal-casing tablet devices, the frame antenna that uses a part of the metal frame as an antenna's radiator is promising to achieve wide bandwidths for mobile communications. In this paper, the frame antenna based on the simple half-loop antenna structure to cover the long-term evolution 746-960 and 1710-2690 MHz bands is presented. The half-loop structure for the frame antenna is easy for manufacturing and increases the robustness of the metal casing. The dual-wideband operation of the half-loop frame antenna is obtained by using an elevated feed network supported by a thin feed substrate. The measured antenna efficiencies are, respectively, 45%-69% and 60%-83% in the low and high bands. By selecting different feed circuits, the antenna's low band can also be shifted from 746-960 MHz to lower frequencies such as 698-840 MHz, with the antenna's high-band coverage very slightly varied. The working principle of the antenna with the elevated feed network is discussed.

The proposed element consists of two separate U-shaped patches operating at different frequencies and a multistub microstrip feed line. For size miniaturization, the smaller U-shaped patch is embedded in the larger one. In addition, the multistub feed line can generate two controllable resonant modes as well as two nulls in realized gain at the boresight direction. Since the modes of the patches and multistub feed line can be controlled individually, the two operating bands can be tuned to desired frequencies. Also, the radiation nulls in boresight gain can be controlled, high roll-off rate and out-of-band radiation rejection levels are thus obtained. For demonstration, a low profile (0.009λ0) dual-band filtering antenna element operating at 1.9 and 2.6 GHz for TD-LTE applications (B39 and B38-bands) is implemented. Dual-band bandpass responses and four radiation nulls are observed in the experiment. Measured in-band gains are 6.7 and 7.3 dBi, whereas out-of-band gains are less than -10 dBi. Based on this element, a four-element MIMO antenna is further designed for LTE CPEs, where low profile and high integration of multiple components are required.

Meanwhile, nanoloops are promising in the optical regime for their applications in a wide range of emerging technologies. Unfortunately, analytical expressions for the radiation properties of conducting loops have not been extended to the optical regime. This paper presents closed-form expressions for the electric fields, total radiated power, directivity, and gain for thin-wire nanoloops operating in the terahertz, infrared and optical regimes. This is accomplished by extending the formulation for PEC loops to include the effects of dispersion and loss. The expressions derived for a gold nanoloop are implemented and the results agree well with full-wave computational simulations, but with a speed increase of more than 300×. This allows the scientist or engineer to quickly prototype designs and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics. Moreover, through rapid numerical experimentation, these closed-form expressions made possible the discovery that broadband super-directivity occurs naturally for nanoloops of a specific size and material composition. This is an unexpected and potentially transformative result that does not occur for PEC loops. Additionally, the Appendices give useful guidelines on how to efficiently compute the required integrals.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2624150","Spanish Ministry of Education through the Commission Fulbright Program “Salvador de Madariaga”(grant numbers:PRX14/00320); Spanish and Andalusian Research Programs(grant numbers:TEC2013-48414-C3-01,P12-TIC-1442); Center for Nanoscale Science, NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center(grant numbers:DMR-1420620); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7728022","Antenna theory;loop antennas;nanotechnology;submillimeter wave technology","Impedance;Antennas;Closed-form solutions;Biomedical optical imaging;Conductors;Dispersion;Optical losses","","22","","45","IEEE","1 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The repeater system does not require down-conversion and up-conversion with frequency translation and does not rely on any operational protocol to manage users. As a result, the repeater (RF booster) can support all users, channels, modulation themes, and devices simultaneously. Close to 70 dB of isolation between the Tx and Rx antennas over the entire band (~100 MHz) is achieved for a compact structure with lateral dimensions of 8 cm × 12 cm and thickness of 1 cm. The isolation between the Tx and Rx antennas is achieved using polarization mismatch between orthogonal double-stack patch antennas and a novel two-element Rx antenna whose elements are appropriately located with respect to the Tx antenna to cancel the signal leakage from the Tx antenna to the Rx antennas. Two types of repeaters, one utilizing only the ground plane and polarization mismatch, and the second using the two-element Rx antenna in addition to polarization mismatch, are fabricated and tested in different environments. It is shown that more than 30 dB improvement in coverage can be achieved.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2618483","U.S. Army Research Laboratory and prepared through collaborative participation in the Microelectronics Center of Micro Autonomous Systems and Technology, Collaborative Technology Alliance(grant numbers:W911NF-08-2-0004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7592871","Mutual coupling;patch antennas;repeaters","Repeaters;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Couplings;Antenna arrays","","9","","20","IEEE","19 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The requirements are two orthogonal polarizations with good purity and suitability of the array column for 1-D beamforming applications. Since single-layer fabrication without using vertical interconnection accesses is another important requirement, the chosen radiating elements are square microstrip patches, fed at two orthogonal edges. The array feeding is designed in series microstrip line fashion, providing a highly compact structure. In that way, 1-D beamforming agility is gained, when multiple array columns are arranged side by side and the individual columns are fed with appropriate phases. The sidelobe level of the array columns is decreased by implementing an amplitude taper within the series array, following the Dolph-Chebychev distribution. A fast scattering parameter calculation procedure is presented to achieve an efficient simulation and design process. The simulated and measured antenna properties are very stable over a bandwidth of 500 MHz around the center frequency proving that such a challenging dual-polarized design can be successfully implemented at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies with just one metallization layer on a grounded substrate. The design parameters and the design procedure are demonstrated in a step by step manner to give sufficient insight into the process together with the possibility of reusing the antenna array itself, as well as the underlying concepts.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2618847","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy(grant numbers:KF3151001NT3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7593283","5G;antenna arrays;automotive applications;beam forming;phased arrays;planar arrays;radar antennas","Microstrip antenna arrays;Feeds;Microstrip;Microstrip antennas;Array signal processing;Substrates","","47","","26","IEEE","19 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach eliminates the need for mounting of any additional RF components and enables seamless monolithic integration of phase shifters and antennas in SIW technology. As a proof of concept, a two-element slotted SIW-based phased array is designed, fabricated, and measured. The prototype exhibits a gain of 4.9 dBi at 13.2 GHz and a maximum E-plane beam-scanning of ±28° using external windings for biasing the phase shifters. Moreover, the array can achieve a maximum beam-scanning of ±19° when biased with small windings that are embedded in the package.

At a given boundary surface, the GSHDB conditions are governed by two one-forms. In terms of Gibbsian 3-D vector and dyadic algebra, the GSHDB conditions are defined in terms of two vectors tangential to the boundary surface and two scalars. Considering plane-wave reflection from the GSHDB boundary, for two eigenpolarizations, the GSHDB boundary can be replaced by the perfect electric conductor or perfect magnetic conductor boundary. Special attention is paid to the problem of plane waves matched to the GSHDB boundary, defined by a 2-D dispersion equation for the wave vector, making the reflection dyadic indeterminate.

This new approach is then generalized to handle systems with complex dispersion of arbitrarily high-order. It is shown how this results in the second-order accurate algorithms with numerical dispersion relations that can always be cast in the form of continuum dispersion counterparts via simple substitutions, avoiding laborious analysis. This allowed here the first reporting of a numerical Appleton-Hartree equation. The problem of field collocation is handled by the repetition of the Yee algorithm so that all field variables are defined at the corners of a new cubic computational cell. This cell offers new properties, such as full-vector control of the solution at each node. A new technique for deriving the stability condition is introduced to FDTD and shows that the new method has retained the same stability criterion of free-space propagation. Several simulation results are presented, one of which reveals a previously unreported problem, common to some gyrotropic methods-the tendency for spurious fields to arise at source locations.

A stochastic dynamic model for the generation of integrated liquid water content (ILWC) fields is proposed. The model is based on the stochastic differential equations and incorporates the spatial and temporal behavior of ILWC. Classifying the cloud types based on the cloud vertical extent and using the microphysical properties of clouds, the well-known Mie scattering theory and the global statistics for ILWC by International Telecommunications Union-Radio (ITU-R), a unified space-time model for the prediction of induced attenuation due to clouds for frequencies above Ka-band up to optical range is presented.

By replacing the standard straight slot with an interdigitated slot loading, the resonance condition was shifted to the lower operating band, facilitating significant antenna miniaturization and resulting in an element size equal to or smaller than 0.1λ0 in all three dimensions. The antenna design procedure is outlined and a prototype for WiFi applications was fabricated and measured for impedance matching, radiation pattern, and broadside gain. A simulated parametric analysis was performed on the interdigitated slot geometry to determine how the antenna performance is controlled. Then, based on the parametric analysis, it was further demonstrated that the two operational bands of the antenna element could be independently controlled by changing only the geometrical dimensions of the interdigitated slot, leaving the base of the antenna entirely unaltered. As a result, the lower operating band could be fixed while the upper operating band could be shifted by up to 10%.

Additionally, this communication greatly extends the range of both the deterministic and the stochastic macromodeling techniques recently developed in FDTD, thus enabling the solution of a much wider range of problems in computational electromagnetics.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2627026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738461","Finite-difference time domain (FDTD);macromodel;subgridding","Time-domain analysis;Finite difference methods;Computational modeling;Conductivity;Magnetic domains;Antennas;Transfer functions","","4","","23","IEEE","8 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
