In this technique, the reflector element is loaded with mu-negative (MNG) metamaterial unit cells to excite a mu-zero resonance (MZR), which is independent of the size of the antenna. Thus, the antenna can operate at lower frequencies without the need to increase its physical size. To implement the proposed idea, the reflector, which acts as the host transmission line, is positioned at a close distance to the driven element, which is typically a dipole antenna. To validate the proposed technique, two design concepts based on coplanar and broadside-coupled strip configurations are presented, and a wideband Yagi antenna is presented. The antenna achieves a wide operating BW of 70% (0.72-1.48 GHz) with a peak front-to-back ratio (FBR) of 14 dB and peak gain of 4.1 dBi with a compact size of 0.24λ× 0.24λ, where λ is the wavelength at the lowest operating frequency.

The monopoles are surrounded by a specially designed dielectric property distribution. This additional degree of freedom in design enabled by 3-D printing technology is used to tailor the electromagnetic wave propagation. As a result, the desired wireless link gain is enhanced and the undesired spatial crosstalk is reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed dielectric loading approach improves the desired link gain by 8-15 dB and reduces the crosstalk by 9-23 dB from 155 to 165 GHz. As a proof-of-concept, a 60 GHz prototype is designed, fabricated, and characterized. Our measurement results match the simulation results and demonstrate 10-18 dB improvement of the desired link gain and 10-30 dB reduction in the crosstalk from 55 to 61 GHz.

The proposed configuration allows the H-plane horn aperture to be three times thicker than the feed line substrate, which is not possible with the conventional substrate integrated waveguide technology. The transition between the horn layers enhances the matching bandwidth without any aperture modification.

Moreover, complementary split-ring resonator structures are incorporated into the multilayer MS design to realize the dual-band operation of the proposed monopole-MS integrated antenna system. Dispersive analysis of the MS unit cell reveals the underlying radiation mechanism of the antenna. It is observed that the designed MS resonates in both frequency bands with a resonance mode pattern resembling that of the TM10 mode of a rectangular patch antenna, thereby yielding a broadside radiation pattern in both bands. The overall footprint of the antenna is only 0.062λ02, where λ0 is the free space wavelength at 1.9 GHz. Importantly, by using the proposed artificial ground plane, even with a highly miniaturized form factor, the antenna still maintains a peak gain of above 5 dBi and a front-to-back ratio higher than 6 dB within the two operational bands.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2758821","National Science Foundation ASSIST Nanosystems ERC(grant numbers:EEC-1160483); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8055583","Antenna miniaturization;complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR);dual-band antenna;metasurface (MS)","Dual band;Antenna feeds;Patch antennas;Dispersion;Substrates;Integrated circuit modeling","","33","","48","IEEE","2 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Exact analytical expressions exist for predicting the mutual coupling between a variety of antennas, including dipoles and slots. However, due to the complexity of the integrals involved, analytical expressions for evaluating the coupling between loop antennas have not been previously available. This paper presents straightforward analytical expressions for efficient calculation of the coupling between two circular loops at arbitrary locations. The theory is extended to the optical regime by taking into account the dispersion and loss of the material comprising the loop antenna. These analytical expressions provide insight into the physics underlying the mutual coupling phenomenon. Along with the approximate analytical expressions, a useful pseudo-analytical representation is developed which is more exact, especially in the near-field regime, and can be easily and efficiently evaluated in MATLAB via numerical integration. It is shown that full-wave simulations for a two-element array of nanoloops can take up to six hours, while the corresponding analytical and pseudo-analytical implementations derived here take less than a minute.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2754411","Spanish Ministry of Education-Commission Fulbright Program “Salvador de Madariaga” for sponsoring the joint research collaboration(grant numbers:PRX14/00320); Spanish and Andalusian research programs(grant numbers:TEC2013-48414-C3-01,P12-TIC-1442); Center for Nanoscale Science; NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center(grant numbers:DMR-1420620); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8046065","Antenna theory;loop antennas;mutual coupling;nanotechnology;submillimeter wave technology","Dipole antennas;Couplings;Mutual coupling;Nanobioscience;Geometry;Wires","","9","","37","IEEE","19 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The entire antenna structure was printed on a single piece of dielectric substrate using standard PCB manufacturing technologies and, hence, is amenable to mass production. A prototype OCP antenna was fabricated on Rogers 5880 substrate and was tested. The measured results are in good agreement with their simulated values and confirm the reported design concepts. Good OCP radiation patterns were produced with a measured peak realized RHCP gain of 2.2 dBic.

However, low-frequency magnetic waves propagate with low attenuations through these dispersive media as long as these media are nonmagnetic. Unlike static electric fields that can be produced by “free” positive/negative charges, static magnetic fields are divergence-free and thus can be produced only by particles with noninteger spins (i.e., electrons), or permanent magnets, or current loops. Fields produced by these dipoles decay steeply as a third-order function of distance. Hence, magnetic current loops require excessively large currents to produce detectable magnetic field at large distances. However, rare-earth magnets with surface magnetic flux densities of 0.3-0.6 T, provide sufficiently large fields at large distances, thus the fields produced by these magnets that can be modulated by mechanically modulating the magnets for portable wireless magnetic field communication. Here, we present the development of an electromechanically modulated permanent magnet antenna operating at a frequency of 22 Hz, producing a magnetic flux density of $0.6~\mu \text{T}$ amplitude at 1 m.

The driving signals at the multiple antenna feeds are scaled properly in amplitude and phase, so that they collectively synthesize the desired on-antenna current/voltage distribution and achieve the resulting desired far-field radiation pattern. The proposed multifeed antenna offers flexibility to optimize the antenna driving impedances based on the locations of the feeds. It also simplifies the passive impedance matching and power-combining networks between the antenna feeds and the transmitter outputs, substantially increasing the total transmitter power efficiency. Most importantly, the proposed multifeed antenna achieves on-antenna low-loss power combining, which, compared with antenna array-based spatial power combining, does not suffer from narrowed beamwidth or enlarged antenna panel size. As proof of concept, multifeed slot antennas and a multifeed square loop antenna are designed and characterized at 10.3 GHz. Conventional single-feed slot antennas and a single-feed square loop antenna are also implemented as reference designs. Well matched antenna gains and radiation patterns between the proposed multifeed antennas and the conventional single-feed antennas are achieved in the measurements, demonstrating the on-antenna power combining of the proposed multifeed antennas without distorting the far-field radiation patterns.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2764119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8070976","Antenna;multifeed antenna;power combining;radiation pattern;slot antenna;square loop antenna","Slot antennas;Antenna feeds;Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Impedance;Transmitting antennas","","55","","56","IEEE","18 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the complexity of the large aperiodic array design problem, we study the use of discrete rotated tiles with element positions and tile orientations optimized to minimize peak sidelobe level (PSLL). The directivity, frequency sensitivity of PSLL, and optimization complexity for uniform arrays, aperiodic arrays, and tiled arrays are compared. Based on many numerical examples, an approximate relationship between PSLL and array element number and density for aperiodic and tiled arrays is proposed as a convergence estimator for the design optimization process.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2766679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8085152","Aperiodic arrays;array antennas;peak sidelobe level (PSLL);rotated tiles","Phased arrays;Optimization;Antenna radiation patterns;Analytical models;Transmission line matrix methods;Complexity theory","","43","","28","IEEE","26 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The analytical result shows that when the distance between two short dipoles approaches zero, their far-field radiations can be mutually canceled at the frequency where the derived condition is satisfied. Furthermore, simulation and experiments are performed to verify that either a single particle or a random collection of such particles could have omnidirectional invisibility.

An approach to the implementation of a conformal PML for higher order meshes is also presented, based on a method of normal projection for PML mesh generation around an already existing convex volume mesh of a dielectric scatterer, with automatically generated constitutive material parameters. Once the initial mesh is generated, a PML optimization method based on gradient descent is implemented to most accurately match the PML material parameters to the geometrical interface. The numerical results show that the implementation of a conformal PML in the higher order finite-element modeling paradigm dramatically reduces the reflection error when compared to traditional PMLs with piecewise constant material parameters.

To avoid the computationally demanding and arguably hard choice of the optimal Tikhonov regularization term involved in the procedure, a second version of S-DBIM, which is more robust against noise and has faster convergence, is also proposed. Thorough numerical simulations show that both versions of S-DBIM achieve super-resolved retrievals of the benchmark “Austria” profile.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2766658","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8085162","High-resolution imaging;image reconstruction;inverse problems;microwave imaging","Nonuniform electric fields;Inverse problems;Optimization;Iterative methods;Scattering;Image reconstruction","","77","","21","IEEE","26 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The formulations are also well-posed so the effects of noise and measurement errors on the reconstructions are also well behaved. The approaches are well suited for the detection of soft faults since they are based on the assumption that the medium is weakly scattering. We demonstrate the techniques with both experimental and numerical results.

Some applications may set constraints with respect to the antenna array physical size. If we increase the number of radiating elements in a given array size to maximize the degrees of freedom (DoF), the spacing between neighboring elements reduces to less than half of the free-space wavelength. Consequently, the electromagnetic coupling between the antenna elements becomes stronger. The result is a distortion of the radiation patterns, and mismatch at the antenna ports. This will have serious effects on the performance of any DoA estimator. Whereas the radiation pattern distortion, which is known from calibration measurements, can be considered by the DoA estimator, the power mismatch causes a loss of received signal power, and therefore, the SNR is reduced. This can only be mitigated by an analog decoupling and matching network (DMN), applied directly at the antenna array outputs, before digitalization. The DMN together with the antennas will exhibit mutually orthogonal radiation patterns, referred to as eigenpatterns. The output ports are, as a consequence, ideally “decoupled,” and the power spread of the eigenmodes will reflect the available DoF. We investigate the influence of the DMN design to the DoA performance in terms of the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). We show that both decoupling and matching will have a positive impact on the average CRLB. Moreover, for the application case of DoA estimation using small flying unmanned aerial vehicle platforms, we describe the performance of a specific circular array with L-quad antenna elements, and demonstrate the need for dual-polarimetric design and calibration.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2757968","Brazilian Army, on behalf of the Ministry of Defense; Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES)(grant numbers:15.2.0675.1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8053774","Compact antenna arrays;coupling;cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB);direction finding;direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation;eigenmode decomposition","Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Directive antennas;Estimation;Arrays","","17","","37","IEEE","29 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With these modifications, the IFA is miniaturized, and yet it is able to simultaneously cover the MedRadio band (401-406 MHz) and ISM bands (902-928 MHz and/or 2.4-2.5 GHz). The resulting configurations remain simple and compact despite the modifications, which is very desirable for conformal capsule type of applications. Furthermore, the impedance matching characteristics of the proposed IFAs remain stable even when a battery is added inside the capsule and the size or the position of the battery is modified. Moreover, the impedance matching of the antenna continues to remain stable even as its surrounding environment is changed. The operating principle of the proposed dual-/tri-band IFAs is discussed in detail and parametric study is carried out to investigate the characteristics of the proposed antennas.

This CSB-based NF-FF transformation is applicable to all three conventional NF measurement techniques, namely, to the planar, cylindrical, and spherical as well as to an arbitrary measurement surface. In this technique, a set of CSBs launched radially out from the antenna under test (AUT) is used to represent its NF. The weights of these CSB radiation basis functions are found by matching them to the measured AUT NF on the measurement surface. Once the CSB weights are found, the same CSBs remain continuously valid everywhere from NF to FF. It is noted that due to the occurrence of a natural Gaussian-like field taper away from each beam axis, only a relatively few CSBs are typically needed to represent the AUT fields at any point in its far zone in comparison to the conventional plane wave or vector wave function expansions for a given size of AUT. The remaining CSBs can be discarded with negligible error. This property among a few others leads to some advantages over conventional NF-FF methods.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2758420","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8055564","Antenna measurements;antenna radiation patterns;beams;complex source;near fields;near-field to far-field (NF–FF) transformation","Noise measurement;Antenna measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Feeds;Weight measurement","","12","","31","IEEE","2 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The balun is created by gradually tapering the outer conductor of the coaxial feed line into two parallel strips, leaving two tapered slots on the outer conductor. Implementing the balun within the outer conductor of the coax itself helps reduce the overall diameter of the antenna compared to interstitial antennas that use conventional coaxial baluns. The tapered-slot balun connects the dipole antenna comprised of three active segments to the coaxial feed line. One active segment is defined by an extension of the inner conductor of the coaxial cable, acting as one arm of the dipole. The other two active segments are located in the two slots created by tapering the outer conductor and connected to its distal end to constitute the second arm of the dipole. We designed the antenna to operate at 6 GHz in ex vivo bovine liver and fabricated a prototype to conduct ablation experiments. Simulation and experiment results show that the tapered balun provides good impedance matching between the coaxial feed line and the dipole and helps the antenna achieve localized ablation zones.

Moreover, the single-layer antenna provides better than 62 dB interport isolation for 10 dB-return loss impedance bandwidth (BW) of 50 MHz. Measured interport isolation for implemented antenna with slot coupled Tx port achieves around 70 and 79 dB port to port RF isolation for 50 and 20 MHz BWs, respectively, and these are the highest amounts of isolation for a single antenna to best of our knowledge. The antenna with slot coupled Tx port provides more interport RF isolation as compared to single-layer antenna due to low coupling between slot coupled and co-planar quarter-wave microstrip fed ports.

Under differential-mode excitation, the H-shaped resonator can be effectively coupled with the line resonator, and thus differential signals can be radiated. However, under CM excitation, the H-shaped resonator cannot be excited so that the CM suppression can be achieved.

The key idea is that of selecting, as a desired pattern, a Gaussian function having small standard deviation, so as to obtain a narrow beam. This immediately provides the excitation density of the corresponding continuous array of infinite length. Starting from this result and considering a linear array of length L with N elements having equal excitations, an extremely fast and accurate algorithm based on a density tapering approach is proposed that yields suitable positions of the elements, in such a way as to provide an array factor that well approximates the desired pattern. Numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the developed procedure, also when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed approach does not consider the mutual coupling between the array elements, but it is numerically shown that this effect produces quite acceptable degradation on the synthesized patterns. Finally, it is shown that also problems involving thousands of elements can be solved in a very accurate way in few milliseconds.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2765744","Italian Ministry of University and Research(grant numbers:FRA 2015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8080225","Density tapering;Gaussian distribution;geometrical synthesis;pencil beams;sparse antenna arrays","Mathematical model;Linear antenna arrays;Standards;Approximation algorithms;Fourier transforms;Gaussian distribution","","28","","21","IEEE","23 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, the efficiency and bandwidth of a vortex beam are limited by impure copolarized components and the intrinsic dispersion of passive resonant structures. Here, we propose a strategy to generate wideband vortex beams by using a Pancharatnam-Berry metasurface in which two orthogonal reflections exhibit a broadband out-of-phase difference. To achieve this, a broadband strategy based on multimode operation and dispersion engineering methods was established. A dual-layer meta-atom is proposed; each layer comprises of five metallic dipoles, and the geometrical parameters are carefully adjusted to tune the resonant frequencies. Because the dipole orientations in each layer are orthogonal, the reflection responses under the two orthogonal polarizations can be independently engineered. Both numerical and experimental results indicate that our method not only enables a high-efficiency spiral beam conversion over a broad range of 6.95-18 GHz (>82%) but also causes a polarization-insensitive effect; thus, it can be adapted for any linear or circular polarization.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2761548","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61501499); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2016JQ6001); National Defense Foundation of China(grant numbers:2201078); Innovative Talents Cultivate Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2017KJXX-24); Aviation Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:20161996009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8063427","Circular polarization;metasurface;orbital angular momentum (OAM);Pancharatnam–Berry phase (PB);vortex beam","Reflection;Broadband antennas;Broadband communication;Bandwidth;Spirals;Dispersion;Structural engineering","","215","","39","IEEE","9 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
