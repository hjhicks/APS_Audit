The horn is easily fabricated due to the simple structure. Comparisons are made between the performances of a four-mode feed horn and a seven-mode feed horn. The seven-mode feed horn is finally adopted for two reasons. First, the construction size is larger, and thus, it is easier to machine. Second, the active voltage standing-wave ratio is acceptable lower. A good compromise between the sum and difference beams is also achieved. The multimode feed horn is fabricated as part of the Cassegrain antenna. The simulation and measurement results of the Cassegrain antenna have shown good performances. The antenna efficiency reaches up to about 47%, and the 3-dB beamwidths are approximately 1.5° at operating frequencies. The sidelobe level is less than -15 dB in azimuth plane and less than -18 dB in elevation plane.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2686016","National Natural Science Fund of China(grant numbers:61401009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7885037","Cassegrain antenna;compromise of sum and difference beams;multimode feed horn;tracking antenna","Antenna feeds;Structural beams;Azimuth;Horn antennas;Rectangular waveguides;Apertures","","23","","18","IEEE","22 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, a conventional MPA with the shorting wall is studied to demonstrate that none of the redundant modes can be excited between the dual-resonant modes. Then, a pair of shorting pins are appropriately installed underneath the patch to progressively turn up the resonant frequency of TM0,1/2 mode without significant influence on that of TM0,3/2 mode. After that, a V-shaped slot is etched out on the patch to dramatically reduce the resonant frequency of TM0,3/2 mode with little effect on that of TM0,1/2 mode. With the use of these arrangements, the dual-desired radiative resonant modes are gradually moved in proximity to each other, thus widening the impedance bandwidth under emergence of dual resonant poles. In order to validate the principle and design method, the proposed antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured results demonstrate that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed shorted patch antenna has been extended to about 11.8%, and it is about 1.82 times of 6.5% of the traditional shorted MPA. Meanwhile, the fabricated antenna exhibits other attractive performances including stable radiation pattern, same polarization, and a low-profile property with the height of 0.042 free-space wavelength.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2688802","National Natural Science Foundation of China through General Program(grant numbers:61571468); University of Macau through Multi-Year Research(grant numbers:MYRG2014-00126-FST,MYRG2015-00010-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7888943","Dual resonant modes;shorting pin;single-layer planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA);V-shaped slot;wide bandwidth","Patch antennas;Impedance;Pins;Resonant frequency;Wideband","","81","","25","IEEE","29 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The thickness of the antenna is only 0.2 mm, which can be wrapped inside a capsule's inner wall. By cutting meandered slots on the patch, using open-end slots on the ground, and utilizing two long arms, the proposed antenna obtains a significant size reduction. In the conformal form, the antenna volume measures only 66.7 mm3. A single-layer homogeneous muscle phantom box is used for the initial design and optimization with parametric studies. The effect of the internal components inside a capsule is discussed in analyzing the antenna's performance and to realize a more practical scenario. In addition, a realistic human body model in a Remcom XFdtd simulation environment is considered to evaluate the antenna characteristics and CP purity, and to specify the specific absorption rate limit in different organs along the gastrointestinal tract. The performance of the proposed antenna is experimentally validated by using a minced pork muscle phantom and by using an American Society for Testing and Materials phantom immersed in a liquid solution. For measurements, a new technique applying a printed 3-D capsule is devised. From simulations and measurements, we found that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna is more than 20% and with a maximum simulated axial ratio bandwidth of around 29.2% in homogeneous tissue.

We demonstrate that, for an appropriate choice of the modulation index, the relative bandwidth is inversely proportional to the antenna radius in terms of a wavelength, by a coefficient which is directly proportional to the group velocity at the central frequency of the SW supported by the average impedance. It is seen, therefore that the product bandwidth-gain is linearly proportional by means of the same coefficients to the antenna radius in wavelengths.

This means that the antenna may simultaneously support two orthogonal channels, which represents interesting polarization diversity characteristics for wireless communications. The double asymmetric (DA) unit cell combines a circularly polarized LA unit cell and a coupled mode TA unit cell, where the former provides equal radiation in the series and shunt modes while the latter separates these two modes in terms of their excitation ports. It is also shown that the degree of TA in the DA unit cell controls the cross-polarization discrimination level.

In the second approach, the whole aperture is shared by a superposition of individual modulations, which correspond to those required to obtain beams in the desired set of directions. It is shown that the latter solution provides beams with a higher gain. The configuration based on a multisource feeding scheme is also tailored by a superposition of modulation patterns. The main advantage of the latter approach is the possibility of having one independent beam at a time when each of the sources are active, as opposed to the single-source case where all the beams coexist at the same time. Closed-form expressions are provided for the MTS surface impedance in each of the proposed solutions. The design equations include appropriate amplitude tapering to improve the beam efficiency.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of environmental material properties uncertainty on the problem of microwave breast imaging. Specifically, we analyze sensitivity to errors in the modeled environment, relative to sensitivity to breast tissue features of interest for a fixed enclosed array design. We also evaluate the impact of changing the array configuration (decreasing antenna-to-breast spacing and increasing breast compression) on these sensitivities. The results illustrate several regimes in which the model noise associated with uncertainty in the material properties in the array environment is comparable to the signals associated with the features of interest in the breast.

A physical optics (PO) code is used to investigate the focusing capabilities and operating range of two 2-D antennas: Van Atta arrays and phase-conjugate/time-reversal arrays. In the PO analysis, the antennas are assumed to be ideal mirrors, which do not backscatter the impinging energy but rather completely absorb and reemit it. Sources located in both the near and far field of the antennas are considered. It is shown that for distances larger than the mirror size, the two antennas have similar focusing capabilities. In such scenarios, a Van Atta approach is preferred over a phase-conjugate approach due to its ease of implementation. Antenna elements used to realize these arrays/mirrors are typically resonant and exhibit strong backscatter, a limited field of view, and small bandwidth. To overcome these limitations, we propose an array/mirror consisting of long slots fed by parallel plate waveguides. A spectral Green's function approach is used to derive the scattering performance of the infinite array in reception. It is shown that the array can collect the total power impinging from a remote source over a large field of view and bandwidth. The conclusions arrived at for the infinite case are extended to the finite case through full-wave simulations. It is shown that the array can refocus the energy impinging from a close source over a large bandwidth. An infinite magnetic line source is considered as an example. An accurate expression is provided for the voltage distribution across the feed lines of the array. The proposed solution paves the way toward the practical implementation of ideal Van Atta and time-reversal/phase-conjugate mirrors.

In order to cancel the feed probe inductance, the array elements comprise additional degrees of freedom to introduce controllable capacitance. Concurrently, individual ground planes and parasitic decoupling walls are proposed as an effective structure to considerably increase the E-plane scanning angle of the phased array by reducing the magnitude of near-field mutual coupling.

For the measurement of the efficiency of a passive all-excited antenna array in an RC, a power divider is normally used to excite all the ports of the array simultaneously. The presence of the power divider introduces additional insertion loss to the antenna array. How to calibrate the insertion loss accurately is a problem for such a measurement. In the existing method, the effect of the mismatch between the array elements and the power divider was not taken into consideration, which could result in inaccurate evaluation of the efficiency of the antenna array. In this paper, an improved method of measuring the antenna array efficiency is presented. It allows the de-embedding of the power divider which removes the insertion loss of the power divider, thus it obtains the efficiency of an antenna array more accurately. This is realized by introducing proper attenuators between antenna array elements and power divider ports. Simulations and measurements have been conducted to verify the proposed method. It is shown that this method is accurate even when the array elements are not well matched with the power divider, especially for the wideband antenna arrays, where good impedance matching of array elements is difficult to maintain. The advantages and limitations of this approach are also discussed. The proposed method should be very useful for accurate and efficient measurement of antenna array efficiency.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2684133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7880570","Antenna array;antenna efficiency;power divider;reverberation chamber (RC)","Antenna measurements;Antenna arrays;Power dividers;Insertion loss;Extraterrestrial measurements;Loss measurement","","5","","17","IEEE","17 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accordingly, the radar cross section of a covered metallic surface in an anechoic chamber was measured and compared at on- and off-plasma states. A significant EM wave dissipation in the frequency band was observed using a thin low-pressure plasma absorber in this paper. Both qualitative tests and quantitative experimentations based on the EM scattering theory clearly verified the ability of the proposed practical coating structure in radar cross-section reduction.

The introduction of periodicity in the Green's function formulation produces image sources at each lattice site. Like multilevel FMA (ML-FMA), P-FMA takes advantage of the distance between image sources and observation points to factorize the field using multipoles. By substituting known factorizations of the free-space Green's function into the expression for PGF, one can isolate the summation over the lattice into the translation phase of the FMA. For both plane wave and multipole factorizations, a common term known as lattice constant appears. The lattice constant is an infinite sum over the lattice which does not converge absolutely when expressed as a spatial sum. Using the Ewald summation technique, the lattice constants can be evaluated with exponential convergence and high accuracy.

The simulation results show that the first-plasmon resonance, exhibited by an individual CNT, splits into multiple resonances when multiple CNTs agglomerate into tumbleweed configurations. The number of the resonances increases linearly with the number of CNTs inside the tumbleweed. The second-plasmon resonance exhibits similar splitting behavior. This splitting in the plasmon resonances is caused by the asymmetry of shapes of CNTs and their proximity to each other. If sufficient CNTs agglomerate, the split first-plasmon and second-plasmon resonances overlap, leading to an overall broadband behavior. These results indicate the importance of precise modeling of CNT shapes and the distribution of shapes on the electromagnetic response. Our computations qualitatively explain the broadband response of CNT films and composites and should aid in the development of novel broadband materials and devices based on CNTs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2691475","National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through the project “Carbon Nanocomposite Manufacturing: Processing, Properties, Performance”; NIST(grant numbers:70NANB15H285); NSF CRI(grant numbers:1629908); NIST(grant numbers:70NANB13H202,70NANB15H282); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7892836","Carbon nanotubes (CNTs);composites;conductivity;electromagnetic scattering;plasmon resonances","Shape;Electromagnetic scattering;Resonant frequency;NIST;Plasmons;Computational modeling","","7","","51","USGov","5 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Complex and diverse radiation patterns form the cornerstone of this approach. Electrically large antennas, such as mode-mixing cavities and metamaterial apertures, have proven to be effective platforms for generating such waveforms. Due to the complex nature of these antennas, near field scanning is often required to characterize their radiation patterns. However, accurate knowledge of the produced waveforms' spatial distribution, with respect to the physical position of the antenna, is imperative. This relies on precise alignment between the antenna and the near field scan stage during the characterization process-a requirement that is especially cumbersome to achieve when operating at high frequencies. We present an effective method to address this problem; by introducing RF markers into the antenna the position of the antenna under test within the near field scanning setup can be obtained directly from the measurements. The proposed method is experimentally verified through comparison with measurements made using optical photogrammetry.

We prove that the extracted asymptotic contribution conforms to the classical asymptotic diffraction theory.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2685633","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61501298); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7885083","Electromagnetic scattering;high-frequency asymptotic diffraction;isorefractive half-space","Diffraction;Media;Electric fields;Antennas;Magnetic fields;Creep;Electromagnetic scattering","","4","","12","IEEE","22 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The unit cell of the proposed PRRS consists of a square and L-shaped patches printed on a substrate, which is covered by a superstrate and backed by a metallic ground. The two patches are connected to the ground using two metallic vias, respectively. Compared with the previously reported PRRS, the polarization rotation bandwidth of the proposed PRRS is enhanced from 49% to 97% with a high PCR of 96%. The frequency responses within the operation frequency band are consistent under oblique incident waves. Furthermore, the designed PRRS is applied to the ultra-wideband radar cross-section (RCS) reduction by forming a checkerboard surface. A 10-dB RCS reduction is achieved over an ultra-wideband of 98%. To validate the simulation results, a prototype of the checkerboard surface is fabricated and measured. A good agreement between the experimental and simulation results is obtained.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2694879","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61372001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7903647","High efficiency;polarization rotation reflective surface (PRRS);radar cross section (RCS);ultra-wideband","Ultra wideband technology;Bandwidth;Surface impedance;Reflection;Resonant frequency;Electric fields;Surface waves","","148","","36","IEEE","18 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, different from the previous works, the lengths of the corrugations are independently optimized to reach the final design. It is shown that by letting more parameters to be optimized in the design process, we can obtain a more effective CVA, which has more suitable characteristics for MWI applications (i.e., higher gain, broader bandwidth) compared with the previous designs. Apart from that, the imaging performance of the proposed design is compared with a generic VA having the same size of the proposed antenna. As imaging algorithm, a recently introduced qualitative MWI technique, the scattering parameter-based linear sampling method (S-LSM), is employed. The similarity between exact shapes of the targets and the obtained qualitative results are compared with the help of the well-known Jaccard index. Experimental results show that the proposed CVA performs better than a generic VA in such real-world MWI problems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2670228","Turkish Science and Research Council(grant numbers:113E977); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857762","Inverse scattering linear sampling method (LSM);microwave imaging (MWI);Vivaldi antenna (VA)","Antenna measurements;Imaging;Bandwidth;Vivaldi antennas;Slot antennas;Shape","","104","","30","IEEE","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All the errors resulted from the same incorrect assumption: at the end of Section II, the computational complexity of calculating the singular value decomposition (SVD) of an  $m \times n$  matrix  ${\mathbf{A}}$  was presented as  $\mathcal {O}(m^{{{{2}}}}n+n^{{{{3}}}})$ —the cost of computing the full SVD  ${\mathbf{A}}={\mathbf{U}}\Sigma {\mathbf{V}}^{\dagger }$  using the R-SVD algorithm [2], assuming  $m\ge n$  (otherwise  $m$  and  $n$  are interchanged). The algorithm in [1], however, uses the SVD for computing  $\Sigma $ ,  ${\mathbf{V}}^{\dagger }$ , and only the first  $n$  columns of  ${\mathbf{U}}$ , at an  $\mathcal {O}(mn^{{{{2}}}}+n^{{{{3}}}})$  cost only [2]. Indeed, the standard SVD implementations ensure that this computation costs  $\mathcal {O}(mn\min [m,n])$  [3]. Accordingly, [1] should have used SVD costs of  $\{\mathcal {O}(m^{{{{2}}}}n), \mathcal {O}(mn^{{{{2}}}})\}$  rather than  $\{\mathcal {O}(n^{{{{3}}}}),\mathcal {O}(m^{{{{2}}}}n)\}$ , when  $\{m<n,m\ge n\}$ . Using these impacts several complexity expressions in [1] and its conclusion as detailed next.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2697413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7938531","","Integral equations;Computational electromagnetics;Approximation methods;Matrix decomposition;Singular value decomposition","","1","","6","IEEE","2 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
