The product of all of these factors provides the overall efficiency of the antenna. New, quite general analytical formulas are suggested to estimate any individual efficiency. In particular, it is seen that εfeed can reach also 90% by using planar or quasiplanar circularly symmetric sources. It is also proven that the product εconvεtap cannot be larger than 58% for a uniform modulation; however, by using a nonuniform modulation, it can be increased to reach εconvεtap ≈ a/λ/(a/λ + 2), where a/λ is the antenna radius in free-space wavelengths. A new closedform formula for estimating the losses is given. In accordance with the prescription given here, one can reach 75% of global efficiency, including losses, until a radius of 20 wavelengths with commercially available substrates.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2669728","European Space Agency through Low Complexity Data Downlink Antenna(grant numbers:ESA-ESTEC 4000111496/14/NL/GLC/al); Army Research Laboratory, RDECOM(grant numbers:W911NF-15-1-0528); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7856971","Antenna efficiency;leaky waves (LWs);metasurface (MTS) antennas","Modulation;Apertures;Antenna feeds;Slabs;Surface impedance","","80","","28","IEEE","15 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dual-band omnidirectional monopole antenna is designed as a radiating source and surrounded by the proposed two cylindrical AFSS screens. The unit cells of the two proposed AFSS screens consist of two metallic crosses connected by a pin diode vertically. By switching the pin diodes, the transmission and reflection characteristics of unit cell of the two AFSS are investigated, respectively, at their own operating frequency.

In this paper, a compact and low profile CP antenna having omnidirectional pattern on azimuthal plane is demonstrated. The CP waveform is synthesized by combining two linearly polarized and omnidirectional antennas with 90° phase difference on their terminals. The most challenging part of the design is the realization of the horizontally polarized antenna with omnidirectional radiation pattern. This antenna is designed using a novel two-faced slot antenna structure capable of emitting in-phase radiation of equal magnitude on both sides of the antenna. The two faces of the low-profile slot antenna are connected by a thin meander parallel plate waveguide to provide antiparallel field distributions over the two faces of the slot radiators. This special design removes radiation nulls on E-plane that exists on conventional slot antennas, the mechanism of which has been carefully discussed in this paper. The other antenna is a compatible pair of planar inverted-F antennas constructed on the sides of the finite-ground plane two-faced slot antenna for the provision of vertically polarized omnidirectional radiation. A feed network with power splitter and phase shifter is also accommodated on the compact CP antenna. The antenna is designed and fabricated, and its performance is measured against numerical simulations. It is shown that the fabricated antenna at 2.4 GHz can provide measured axial ratio of lower than 1.8 and gain variations of less than ±1.5 dB over all azimuth angles.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2669959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857003","Antenna feeds;aperture antennas;circular polarization;omnidirectional antennas;slot antennas","Slot antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Radar antennas;Omnidirectional antennas;Antenna feeds;Microstrip antennas","","49","","29","IEEE","15 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The potential of reconfigurable decoupling and matching of such an antenna system, purely controlled by tunable decoupling and matching networks, is studied. The concept is evaluated by different classes of examples. First, fundamental aspects of decoupling and matching are discussed on the basis of several generic antenna matrices. Thereafter, a three-element antenna system of a mobile terminal is investigated by numerical simulations to calculate the achievable bandwidth of each tuning.

The proposed antenna consists of four rotationally symmetric beamforming networks (BFNs) and a microstrip patch array-based HIS. Regarding to the BFN, it is formed by a planar offset parabolic reflector fed by multiple substrate integrated waveguides. Through proper design, the proposed BFN can efficiently launch guided SWs with TM0 mode. With the perturbation of the HIS structure, the bounded SWs can be transformed to m = -1 space harmonic mode leaky-wave radiation. Combining the feature of the leakywave radiation in the elevation plane and the manipulation of the propagation direction of the SWs by switching the feeding ports, beam scanning in the azimuth direction with a tilted elevation angle can be realized. As the HIS is shared by the four BFNs, the size of the antenna can be reduced and a broadened antenna scanning range is achieved. In this paper, a prototype of the proposed antenna with 28 feeding ports, 7 in each BFN, is numerically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated.

Initially, a rectangular differential-fed MPA is theoretically investigated so as to demonstrate that all of the undesired modes between the TM10 and TM30 modes are suppressed or removed out effectively. Then, by symmetrically introducing two pairs of shorting pins, the resonant frequency of TM10 mode is progressively turned up. After that, with the help of two long slots, the resonant frequency of TM30 mode is decreased with slight effect on that of TM10 mode. Furthermore, a short slot is inserted at the center of the patch to cancel the parasitic inductances of the shorting pins and probe feeds. With this arrangement, these two radiative resonant modes are moved in proximity to each other for wideband antenna. Finally, the proposed differential-fed MPA is fabricated and measured. Experimental results illustrate that the impedance bandwidth (|Sdd11| <; -10 dB) of the antenna has gained a tremendous increment up to about 13% (1.88-2.14 GHz), while keeping a low profile property with the height of 0.029 free-space wavelength.

Fundamental limitations on the bandwidth of small antennas have been thoroughly treated in the past. However, upper bounds on radiation efficiency have not been established even though it is also of significant importance. Here, radiation from a thin metallic shell is rigorously analyzed to establish fundamental limits on the radiation efficiency of resonant, electrically small antennas in terms of the size and the metal conductivity. Metallic losses are systematically introduced into the circuit model proposed by Chu, and several resonant antennas with maximum radiation efficiencies are analyzed. Resonant electric and magnetic dipole antennas both have maximum radiation efficiencies near 100% until the size is reduced below a critical value, at which point the efficiency scales as electrical size to the fourth power ((ka)4). It is also shown that a helix antenna that resonantly couples the TM10 mode to the TE10 mode has a maximum radiation efficiency, and is about twice that of a resonant dipole or loop antenna. The closed form expressions reported here provide valuable insight into the design of small antennas with optimal efficiencies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2670532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857743","Chu limit;Q-factor;radiation efficiency;small antennas;spherical antennas","Dipole antennas;Bandwidth;Integrated circuit modeling;Antenna radiation patterns;Impedance;Q-factor","","102","","44","IEEE","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Steering the Beam of Medium-to-High Gain Antennas Using Near-Field Phase Transformation","M. U. Afzal; K. P.

Beam steering is achieved by transforming phase of the antenna near field using a pair of totally passive metasurfaces, which are located just above and parallel to the antenna. They are rotated independently or synchronously around the antenna axis. A prototype, with a peak gain of 19.4 dBi, demonstrated experimentally that the beam of a resonant cavity antenna can be steered to any direction within a large conical region (with an apex angle of 102°), with less than 3-dB gain variation, by simply turning the two metasurfaces without moving the antenna at all. Measured gain variation within a 92° cone is only 1.9 dBi. Contrary to conventional mechanical steering methods, such as moving reflector antennas with multiaxis rotary joints, the 3-D volume occupied by this antenna system does not change during beam steering. This advantage, together with its low profile, makes it a strong contender for space-limited applications where beam steering with active devices is not desirable due to cost, nonlinear distortion, limited power handling, sensitivity to temperature variations, radio frequency losses, or associated heating. This beam steering method using near-field phase transformation can also be applied to other aperture-type antennas and arrays with medium-to-high gains.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2670612","Australian Government under the Australia-India Strategic Research Fund; International Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship Scheme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857713","Aperture field;beam steering;cavity resonator;directivity enhancement;electromagnetic bandgap resonator antenna;Fabry-Perot resonator;frequency selective surface (FSS);high gain;patch antennas;phase correction;phase transformation;phase-shifting surface;reconfigurable antenna;resonant cavity antenna (RCA)","Directive antennas;Delay effects;Beam steering;Turning;Azimuth;Antenna arrays","","207","","28","IEEE","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, such a method has relied only on the dispersion diagram of the periodic structure, i.e., on the eigenvalues of the lattice, neglecting the particular configuration of the associated eigenfunction. This paper explores the radiation mechanism under a novel viewpoint, which is mostly focused on the electric field pattern of lattice modes, allowing a deeper understanding of the underlying physics. Such an approach is profitably used here to improve the performance of antennas based on different Bloch waves by reducing spurious lattice modes. Geometrical configurations coupled to a line source are provided with little adjustments, getting EBGs to work at a frequency where they had no bandgap originally. As a proof-of-concept of the proposed perspectives, a compact antenna using a cheap low-permittivity dielectric is conceived, fabricated, and successfully tested.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2670599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857688","Directive antennas;electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) materials;periodic structures","Lattices;Periodic structures;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Antennas;Dielectrics;Metamaterials;Metals","","17","","40","IEEE","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is applicable to highly directive antennas, measured in anechoic chambers, which size is not large enough to satisfy the far-field condition for the antenna under test (AUT). The method is based on an approximation of the accurate diffraction integral at Fresnel distances by a Fourier integral. According to the method, a quasi far-field radiation pattern of the AUT is measured at a Fresnel distance R, the measured pattern is used for a reconstruction of a distorted, due to the short range, aperture excitation, and the distorted aperture excitation is corrected magnitudewise and phasewise in accordance with R and, then, forward propagated to the far-field. An advantage of the method is that it allows an accurate treatment of the distorted phase and the magnitude of the Green kernel in the diffraction integral, with respect to the ideal far-field, in contrast to the usual quadratic approximation of the phase and expansion in an infinite row of the exponential phase term. The method offers computational precision advantages over existing methods in shorter measurement distances R and low levels of sidelobes. The accuracy of the method improves as the directivity of the AUT gets higher. The measurement distance R must not be too short to smear too much the measured Fresnel pattern and to compromise the validity of the mentioned Fourier approximation of the diffraction integral.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2671034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7858713","Antenna measurements;array antennas;electromagnetic diffraction;Fourier transforms;Fresnel distance;near-/far-field transformations;phased arrays;planar arrays","Antenna measurements;Directive antennas;Diffraction;Phase distortion;Aperture antennas;Manganese","","7","","14","IEEE","17 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Once this local power conservation is established, we invoke previously derived analytical formulas to evaluate the (passive lossless) metasurface constituents that facilitate the required field transformation. We demonstrate this scheme by designing CX-OBMAs that generate radiation patterns with prescribed directivity and side-lobe level, for which the aperture fields can be readily stipulated using established antenna array theory. The good agreement between full-wave simulations and semianalytical predictions points out the immense potential of these novel radiators, capable of controlling near- and far-field distributions almost at will.

The proposed method has minimum measuring time among the known amplitude-only measurement methods. The total number of power measurements with this method is about twice the number of antenna elements of phased array. Phase shifters are required to implement only three phase shifts (0°, 90°, and 180°). Array signal power is measured when the phase setting of an antenna element is one of the three phase shifts. According to the superposition principle of electromagnetic field, array signal is a linear combination of antenna element signals.

The top metal layer contains the radiating slots, the intermediate layer contains the cavities, formed by pins, and the third layer is the ridge gap waveguide corporate-feed network. The latter is realized by a texture of pins and guiding ridges to uniformly excite the cavities with the same amplitude and phase. The proposed antenna fulfills the radiation pattern requirement of the ETSI 320 standard. A prototype consisting of 16 × 16 slots was manufactured by a fast modern planar 3-D machining method, i.e., die-sink electric discharge machining. The fabricated prototype has a relative impedance bandwidth of 17.6% with input reflection coefficient better than -10 dB. The Eand H-planes radiation patterns satisfy the ETSI class II copolar sidelobe envelope, and the measured cross-polar level is more than -30 dB below the copolar level over the 56-75 GHz frequency band.

In addition, owing to the native dual resonant features of the SLR, the proposed antenna exhibits second-order filtering characteristics with improved bandwidth and out-of-band rejections. The antenna is synthesized and the design methodology is explained. The coupling coefficients between the SLR and the patches are investigated.

Measured results agree well with the simulations, showing good performance in terms of bandwidth, filtering, harmonic suppression, and radiation at both bands.

The first layer consists of two Butler matrix beamformer networks (BFNs); one for each TX and RX. The second layer integrates four, ideally phase-matched, circulators between the spiral arms and the BFNs. Theoretically, this configuration achieves infinite isolation irrespective of circulator's quality. However, the BFN imbalances and the dissimilarities between the four circulators degrade the overall isolation. The operational principles are discussed under the ideal conditions and in the presence of circuit imperfections.

An extended Saleh–Valenzuela model with both delay and angular cluster features is used to characterize the measured channel, and the intercluster and intracluster parameters are extracted. We find that the azimuth departure angles are diverse and highly related to the antenna position and measurement environment, while the elevation departure angles are more related to the antenna height difference and confined in a relatively small direction range. The azimuth angle spread is much larger than the elevation angle spread either in global level or in cluster level.

Finally, a set of linear matrix functions are constructed to solve for the EM waves in a borehole based on the concept of the generalized reflection, rather than that of the fictitious boundary. Numerical results in comparison with those from other approaches have demonstrated the validity and stability of our new formulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2670360","Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41304084); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, China(grant numbers:ZR2013DM015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857694","Cylindrical medium;eccentricity;generalized reflection and transmission;horizontal-coil","Reflection;Receivers;Harmonic analysis;Transmitting antennas;Conductivity","","14","","28","IEEE","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Solutions of this kind are convenient whenever the field to scan is the result of line-of-sight (LOS) propagation. In complex media, where multipath propagation imply non-LOS contributions, the introduction of absorbing materials can irremediably alter the behavior of the medium under test and therefore the field to be scanned. In this case, a field scanner rather needs to be as transparent as possible. This paper introduces the main ideas behind an alternative automatic positioning system designed in order to ensure a low perturbation of the response of a medium. The impact of the scanner is assessed when used in a reverberation chamber with a varying degree of reverberation, in order to emulate the conditions found in realistic complex media.

For both cases, the DOF numbers are found to be strongly dependent on the relative sizes between the transmitter and the receiver because of the divergence of the OAM-carrying beams. It is also found that the DOF number of an OAM-based system is less than that of a comparable system allowed to use any supported waves, suggesting that OAM-based multiplexing does not offer any additional performance benefits over traditional spatial multiplexing techniques. Some practical implications of the OAM-based radio are discussed.

We propose a new MBCS simulation model that is based on a rigorous solution to the problem of oblique diffraction of radio waves on ionized meteor trails.

Current phaseless NF to far-field (FF) transformation techniques are highly dependent on the accuracy of the initial phase guess and the pattern features of the AUT. The proposed multiplicatively regularized SRM (MR-SRM) provides a robust and automated framework that can reconstruct the FF pattern of the AUT based on a nonsophisticated initial phase guess. In addition, advantages of the SRM are inherently incorporated into the MR-SRM, such as the capability for antenna diagnostics and allowing for extension to arbitrary measurement domains without the need for data interpolation. The cost functional associated with the MR-SRM is minimized with the conjugate gradient algorithm using closed-form expressions for gradient operators.

To combine additional filtering and harmonic suppression functions within an antenna while realizing circular polarization, a new wideband filtering quadrature coupler was implemented to feed a hollow DRA. The filtering quadrature coupler was based on a snowflake shaped patch, whose operating modes can be flexibly controlled by the loading slots. Quarter wavelength coupled line sections were introduced to the coupler, realizing simultaneously wide bandwidth, excellent bandpass filtering, and wide harmonics suppression characteristics. For demonstration, a filtering CP antenna operating at 1.8 GHz was designed, fabricated, and measured. Reasonable agreement between simulated and measured results was observed. The prototype exhibited excellent bandpass filtering characteristics together with a wide overlapping bandwidth of 27.8%, within which the axial ratio value was less than 3 dB, and return loss was better than 12.4 dB. Over the same band, an average gain of 6 dBic with a variation less than 1 dB was achieved.

The bandwidth enhancement of the RCA is approached by using a second-order height resonant cavity comprising a dielectric slab of high permittivity as the partially reflective surface and a ground plane with spherically modified geometry. It is shown that by imitating an open resonator structure, the spherically modified cavity can support multiple quasi-Laguerre-Gaussian beam modes and hence, dramatically improve the operation bandwidth of the RCA. A RCA with large GBP is designed, simulated, and then verified through measurement. Measured results show a bandwidth of 25% with a peak gain of 17.7 dBi.

The collimated vortex beam is excited in the proximity of the RLSA, within a region properly defined by the nondiffracting range of the generated beam.
