The license plate is operated as a tag antenna since it is conductor (made of aluminum). A desired up-tilted pattern beam is achieved successfully by using a direct CMT-based radiation pattern synthesis procedure. The pattern can be expanded as a superposition of some specific characteristic modes pattern, which is identified according to characteristic mode analysis of the plate. Four coupling slots are exploited to excite the selected modes current distribution. The mode weighting coefficients can be tuned to form the desired pattern beam by changing the relative phase between the coupling slots. The feed structure is carefully designed without damaging the layout of characters and numbers on the license plate. The synthesized radiation pattern corresponds with the pattern simulated by HFSS. The measured radiation pattern proves that the proposed design is reliable and applicable. The measured read range is about 20 m, which can satisfy the actual requirements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2734071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997899","Characteristic mode theory (CMT);coupling slots;mode weighting coefficients;pattern synthesis;radio frequency identification (RFID) tag antenna","Licenses;Couplings;Antenna radiation patterns;Conductors;Current distribution;RFID tags","","37","","22","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The DAM technique has previously been proposed to generate a broadband signal using a rapidly time-varying antenna, but the signals produced using this technique and its limitations are not well understood. In this paper, we quantitatively compare the performance of a DAM transmitter to a conventional time-invariant transmit antenna. We show that the fall time of an RF pulse produced with the DAM configuration is measurably shorter than with the conventional system; however, the pulse rise time using both systems is identical. The performance of each system is then analyzed in terms of the bit error rate over a simple point-to-point link using analytical models, numerical simulation, and measurement. DAM reduces the intersymbol interference (ISI) by reducing the discharging time; however, the overall performance remains similar to the conventional system because of their similar charging times. While the DAM configuration does radiate a qualitatively broader spectrum as observed in previous studies, this does not translate into quantitative improvement in the characteristics of a transmitted data signal.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2734063","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:D16AP00033); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997950","Bit error rate (BER);direct antenna modulation (DAM);ON–OFF keying (OOK)","Broadband antennas;Transmitting antennas;Baseband;Narrowband;Bit error rate;Antenna measurements","","20","","17","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A self-oscillating AIA operates at the UHF radio frequency identification (RFID) band was demonstrated as a proof of concept. Benefitting from the infinite-wavelength property, the embedded ZORs are electrically large and capable of providing efficient power radiation into space. The oscillation parameters, meanwhile, remain good, thanks to the inherent high-quality factor property of metamaterial resonators. Without relying on ground radiation, the new design achieves good radiation and oscillation performances at the same time, hence adding extra flexibility on shaping the radiation pattern. According to the experimental results, the developed AIA, oscillating at 0.92 GHz, features a high dc-to-RF conversion efficiency of 52%, a moderate effective isotropic power of 8.9 dBm, and a low phase noise of -124.7 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset from the carrier frequency.

Initially, our study demonstrates that all of the even-order modes can effectively be suppressed by employing a rectangular PIFA instead of the conventional microstrip patch antenna. Then, a pair of shorting pins is appropriately loaded underneath the side-shorted radiating patch to investigate the variation of their odd-mode resonant frequencies. The results indicate that the resonant frequency of TM0,1/2 mode (f0,1/2) is dramatically increased up while almost maintaining that of TM2,1/2 mode (f2,1/2). After that, the width of the radiating patch is progressively enlarged in order to move the f2,1/2 more closely to the f0,1/2. By using this approach, the dual radiative resonant modes can be reallocated in proximity to each other. Additionally, a narrow slot is etched out on the radiating patch so as to counteract the equivalent inductance caused by the shorting pins and probe. As such, a wide-bandwidth with stable radiation pattern is achieved for the PIFA under the operation of these dual-resonant modes. After the extensive analysis is executed, the proposed antenna is fabricated and tested. Simulated and measured results are found in good agreement with each other, demonstrating that its impedance bandwidth is tremendously widened to about 15.3% with appearance of two in-band attenuation poles. In particular, a low-profile property with the height of 0.036 free-space wavelength is achieved.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2736578","National Natural Science Foundation of China through General Program(grant numbers:61571468); University of Macau through Multi-Year Research(grant numbers:CPG2017-00028-FST,MYRG2015-00010-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010433","Bandwidth enhancement;dual-resonant modes;planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA);shorting pin","Pins;Bandwidth;Resonant frequency;Impedance;Antenna radiation patterns;Probes","","41","","21","IEEE","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a quantity which is the effective width for surface-wave coupling, and derive its value for an isotropic surface-wave radiator in two dimensions. We also determine the surface-wave directivity for dipole-like modes, which is relevant to many small planar antennas. The total coupling between two coplanar antennas is a combination of surface waves and space waves, and these two components are distinguished in simulations by calculating antenna coupling as a function of distance.

In the past, wideband outer-wall antennas have been proposed for capsule-type applications. However, this paper shows that the outer wall is not a good choice for placing capsule antennas, since such a choice exhibits a high specific absorption ratio, low gain, and low efficiency. Instead, the antenna proposed in this paper is conformal to the inner wall of a capsule shell, and it provides a wide impedance bandwidth ranging from 1.64 to 5.95 GHz (113.6%). Furthermore, the impedance matching remains stable even with a change in the operating environment. Since in a typical application scenario a capsule will move through the digestive system, and thus experience varying environments, a wide bandwidth and stable performance are both very desirable attributes of the antenna, whose design is discussed in this paper. Moreover, the proposed antenna continues to maintain a stable impedance match even when a battery is added inside the capsule, or when there is a change in the battery size and/or its position. Given these advantages, we argue that slot antennas are well suited for incorporation into capsule antennas for the present application.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2741027","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61372012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8012537","Conformal capsule antenna;inner wall;slot antenna;wideband","Phantoms;Slot antennas;Bandwidth;Muscles;Impedance matching;Geometry","","77","","25","IEEE","17 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transmission line model suitable for the long grounded wire is constructed, then the calculation formulas of the distributed parameters and load impedance are analyzed, and the transfer function utilized to simulate the current at any position of the transmission line is also derived. The simulation is performed in the frequency domain with subsequent transformation into the time domain, and the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data.

The optimization method has the advantages of simplicity and efficiency, in which the aperture distribution is expanded into a set of cosine functions and the optimization reduces to solving a constrained linear-least-squares problem. Based on the copious computed results from the optimization, an approximate closed-form expression is derived for the maximum directivity. The expression can serve as a bound for the endfire directivity for a line source with a uniform phase progression. It is found that the optimum directivity increases almost linearly with an increase of the normalized phase constant, but with a decrease in the radiated power. Nevertheless, the enhancement in the directivity is much higher than that in previously studied superdirectivity, under the same constraint in the ratio of reactive to radiated power. The current distribution does not oscillate widely as is does for superdirectivity, and is therefore more practical than for superdirectivity.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2742538","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401522,61771497); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013817","Aperture distribution;continuous line source;directivity;endfire;improved directivity","Apertures;Optimization methods;Helical antennas;Phased arrays","","10","","28","IEEE","21 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No matter the zipper is totally closed, quarterly opened, half opened, or is even totally opened, the antenna can operate with acceptable performance, though the common status of the handbag zipper is closed.

The presented method, instead of conventional methods that power dividers and phase delay lines are usually required, not only significantly enhances the bandwidths of the antenna but also results in a compact feed, reduced loss and high gain.

Here, a metasurface is presented that reduces the effects of scan loss for a leaky-wave antenna (LWA). The metasurface is simple, being composed of an ultrathin sheet of subwavelength split-ring resonators. The leaky-wave structure is balanced, scanning from the forward region, through broadside, and into the backward region, and designed to scan in the magnetic plane. The metasurface is effectively invisible at broadside, where balanced LWAs are most sensitive to external loading. It is shown that the introduction of the metasurface results in increased directivity, and hence, gain, as the beam is scanned off broadside, having an increasing effect as the beam is scanned to the horizon. Simulations show that the metasurface improves the effective aperture distribution at higher scan angles, resulting in a more directive main beam, while having a negligible impact on cross-polarization gain. Experimental validation results show that the scan range of the antenna is increased from -39° ≤ θ ≤ +32° to -64° ≤ θ ≤ +70°, when loaded with the metasurface, demonstrating a flattened gain profile over a 135° range centered about broadside. Moreover, this scan range occurs over a frequency band spanning from 9 to 15.5 GHz, demonstrating a relative bandwidth of 53% for the metasurface.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2735454","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000681","Beam scanning;leaky-wave antennas (LWAs);metamaterials;metasurfaces;periodic structures;phased arrays;scan loss","Feeds;Leaky wave antennas;Antenna arrays;Ports (Computers);Apertures;Wideband","","15","","24","IEEE","3 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The parallel LC resonator, implemented by a via-connected metallic line and a parallel-plate capacitor (PPC), serves as the basic element for intentionally constructing FSS unit cell, which exhibits a single-band bandpass filtering response. As a result, the proposed FSS structure can provide a multiband performance by introducing multiple VCMLs and PPCs with different resonance frequencies. Because of the compact resonator resulting from a PPC, the proposed FSSs feature miniaturized unit cell size inherently, for example, the single-band FSS element is as compact as 4.8% of the operating wavelength. Moreover, this kind of FSS structure is also beneficial for independent control of the frequency performance under different polarizations, efficient optimal design of desired resonance frequencies, and easy realization of multiband response with wideband ratio range (e.g., 1.13 to 3.32 for the dual-band FSS). Equivalent circuits of these FSSs are established for explaining the resonating mechanisms and precisely modeling the frequency performances. Finally, prototypes of the dual- and tri-band FSSs are fabricated and measured.

A nontraditional characterization method is required due to the general unavailability of samples of a sufficient size to fill the entire cross sections of waveguides appropriate for lower frequencies where gyromagnetic properties are most pronounced, and the difficulty of predicting or approximating the applied bias magnetic field. The proposed method overcomes the limitation of sample size by requiring only partial filling of a rectangular waveguide. It overcomes a lack of knowledge of the bias field by including the field as an unknown to be determined by the extraction process. The required theoretical reflection and transmission coefficients of the partially filled waveguide are determined using a mode-matching technique. A nonlinear least squares method is employed to extract the gyromagnetic material parameters and the bias field using optimization algorithms in MATLAB. The extracted parameters of a representative commercial ferrite obtained from multiple experimental configurations are compared with the values provided by the sample manufacturer to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2736530","U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA 9550-09-1-0182); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8003367","Antennas;electromagnetic measurement;ferrites;magnetic materials;optimization;permeability;permittivity","Ferrites;Magnetic resonance;Gyromagnetism;Antennas;Rectangular waveguides;Waveguide components","","1","","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We demonstrate the concept of parity- time (PT)-symmetry in uniform CTLs that involve symmetric gain and loss and how this condition is associated with a second-order EPD. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that PT-symmetry is not a necessary condition for realizing EPDs, and indeed, we show that EPD is also obtained with asymmetric distributions of gain and loss in uniform CTLs. We further propose potential applications of the EPDs in designing leakywave antennas with the capability of beam and directivity control as well as enhanced sensitivity.

We demonstrate that, unless this integral is computed to machine precision in the whole impedance matrix, it is imperative to maintain the trianglewise balance in the evaluation of the scalar potential part. A small imbalance, even at very small error, results in a loss of degrees of freedom (DOFs) for the charge distribution, violating the null-space property of the divergence operator and yielding potentially spurious solutions. The effect, although present, may go unnoticed at the conventional frequency regimes, where the usual mesh sizes can be applied.

The most effective techniques to solve these problems, unfortunately, either require the explicit detection of the so-called global loops of the structure, or suffer from numerical cancellation at extremely low frequency. In this contribution, a novel regularization method for the PMCHWT equation is proposed, which is based on the quasi-Helmholtz projectors. This method not only solves both the low frequency and the dense mesh ill-conditioning problems of the PMCHWT, but it is immune from low-frequency numerical cancellations and it does not require the detection of global loops. This is obtained by projecting the range space of the PMCHWT operator onto a dual basis, by rescaling the resulting quasi-Helmholtz components, by replicating the strategy in the dual space, and finally, by combining the primal and the dual equations in a Calderón-like fashion. Implementation-related treatments and details alternate the theoretical developments in order to maximize impact and practical applicability of the approach. Finally, numerical results corroborate the theory and show the effectiveness of the new schemes in real case scenarios.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2738061","Agence Nationale de la Recherche(grant numbers:FASTEEG-ANR-12-JS09-0010); COMINLabs Excellence Laboratory through the Project SABRE(grant numbers:ANR-10-LABX-07-0); HPC resources from GENCI-TGCC(grant numbers:2016-gen6944); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8007283","Calderón preconditioning;computational electromagnetics;integral equations;Poggio–Miller–Chan–Harrington–Wu–Tsai (PMCHWT);quasi-helmholtz projectors","Geometry;Mathematical model;Electric breakdown;Integral equations;Scattering;Standards;Antennas","","10","","38","IEEE","10 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike traditional work that uses equivalent currents defined on surfaces, recent research proposes a technique that results in well-conditioned systems by employing generalized Debye sources (GDS) as unknowns. In a complementary effort, some of us developed a method that exploits the same representation for both the geometry (subdivision surface representations) and functions defined on the geometry, also known as isogeometric analysis (IGA). The challenge in generalizing GDS method to a discretized geometry is the complexity of the intermediate operators. However, thanks to our earlier work on subdivision surfaces, the additional smoothness of geometric representation permits discretizing these intermediate operations. In this paper, we employ both ideas to present a well-conditioned GDS-electric field integral equation. Here, the intermediate surface Laplacian is well discretized by using subdivision basis. Likewise, using subdivision basis to represent the sources results in an efficient and accurate IGA framework.

In particular, we have studied the perturbations in the received signal caused by different types of vehicles as they passed through a channel between two persons who maintained various relative orientations while positioned at the opposite sides of a road. As the channel underwent different fading mechanisms depending on whether the vehicle was approaching, transitioning (i.e., intersecting the direct signal path), or receding from the persons, the overall disturbance was appropriately segmented depending on the journey stage. The results have shown that relative body orientation was a significant factor when considering the impact that a vehicle can have on a W2W link. When both persons faced the oncoming traffic, the link was particularly susceptible to significant fading events with variations in the received signal power from the unperturbed state as great as 44.1 dB observed to occur. For all of the journey stages, irrespective of the relative orientation of the persons, the logarithmically transformed longterm fading process was found to be multimodal and well described by a Gaussian mixture model. During the transitioning phase, shadowing caused by the passing automobile obstructing the line-of-sight signal path was found to be the main contributor to the signal fading. However, probably the most remarkable result of the channel characterization work conducted in this paper was the severity of the short-term fading often observed. Such was the intensity of the measured envelope fluctuation in many of the scenarios, we have been able to utilize the recently proposed κ-μ extreme distribution with great success and in the process, provide a further important empirical validation of this new fading model. Moreover, we have used the resistor-average distance, which is derived from the Kullback-Leibler distance to show the improved fit that the κ - μ extreme distribution offers compared with the κ - μ distribution when used to model the W2W channel in this fading environment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2738071","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/L026074/1); Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme 7/23 BESTCOM initiated by the Belgian Science Policy Office; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8039240","κ – μ distribution;κ – μ extreme distribution;channel measurements;channel modeling;fading channels;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);wearable communications","Fading channels;Shadow mapping;Roads;Attenuation;Antenna radiation patterns;Dipole antennas;Antenna measurements","","8","","38","OAPA","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This formulation utilizes the ultrawideband phase-space BS method, which is structured upon a windowed Fourier transform (WFT) frame expansion of the sources and expresses the field as a discrete phase-space sum of beam propagators. This paper extends the frame concept, proving that this beam set constitutes a frame not only in the source domain, where it reduces to the conventional WFT, but everywhere in the propagation domain. This “beam frame” provides a self-consistent framework for tracking wavefields through scattering media in which the local interaction of the incident beams with the medium is expanded using the same set of beams. The resulting beam-to-beam (B2B) scattering coefficients depend on the local spectral properties of the medium. The overall B2B scattering matrix is therefore compact, coupling only beams that are adjacent in phase space, given the fluctuation properties. The new formulation expresses the entire scattering problem in terms of coefficients dynamics in the phase space. As demonstrated, the formulation is computationally efficient and captures all the relevant phenomenology. Part II extends this formulation for stochastic fields in random fluctuating medium characterized by the medium statistics.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2740970","Israel Science Foundation(grant numbers:263/11,412/15); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8012456","Beam summation (BS) method;Gaussian beams (GBs);phase-space representations;random media;scattering theory;ultrawideband (UWB)","Scattering;Structural beams;Acoustic beams;Media;Apertures;Fourier transforms","","12","","26","IEEE","17 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This theory is used here to derive a BS representation for the stochastic-field for cases where the medium fluctuations are random with a given statistics. The stochastic B2B scattering moments are therefore expressed in terms of the local spectral statistics of the medium projected onto a phase space window formed by the intersection of the excitation and the scattered beams. Since the medium statistics is typically smooth, unlike a single realization, the resulting stochastic B2B scattering matrix is compact and smooth and may actually be calculated analytically. It is demonstrated, via numerical examples and a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, that the formulation is not only computationally efficient, but also provides a compact representation for the scattering phenomenology.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2740971","Israel Science Foundation(grant numbers:263/11,412/15); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8012395","Beam summation (BS) method;Gaussian beams (GBs);phase space representations;random media;scattering theory;ultrawideband (UWB)","Scattering;Media;Apertures;Monte Carlo methods;Antenna theory;Extraterrestrial phenomena","","8","","10","IEEE","17 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides the spatial sparsity of a scene, its structural sparsity is presented using the range profile of the scene, where both can be used to enhance sparsity exploitation during image reconstruction.

The introduced algorithms are based on the reconstruction of the illuminating source at the transmitter, enabling a separation of the sampled signal with respect to the location of its potential sources, the scatterers within the device under test or the transmitter. For the second algorithm, an L1-minimization problem formulation is introduced that enables compressive sensing techniques to be adapted for image retrieval. The algorithms are benchmarked against a more conventional imaging technique, based on the Fourier transform, and it is seen that the complete imaging system provides increased dynamic range, improved resolution, and reduced measurement time by removal of a reference measurement.

In mixed-variable optimization, some variables are continuous (can take any value within a range) and others are discrete (can take only values from a database). An example constraint is when the total length of a device under optimization is specified. Our approach can handle such optimization problems and is based on an abstract probabilistic evolutionary optimization algorithm, called the cross-entropy (CE) method. We believe that this is the first application of CE with full-wave EM simulations. A quick performance benchmarking on two test functions was performed to compare convergence of CE and two other established optimization algorithms. Then, the advantages of the CE method when simultaneously optimizing a mix of discrete and continuous variables and imposing geometric constraints are illustrated. Finally, six resonant cavity antennas (RCAs) were optimized, and one was prototyped and tested to verify predicted results. This one-layer-superstrate RCA prototype has a measured peak directivity of 17.6 dBi with a 3 dB directivity bandwidth of 51% and lower sidelobes, outperforming all such prototypes in the literature.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2740974","Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Australian Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8012475","Bandwidth;covariance matrix adaptation (CMA);covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategies (CMA-ES);cross-entropy (CE);directivity;electromagnetic (EM);evolutionary;Fabry–Perot cavity antenna;high-frequency;high-gain;microwave;particle swarm optimization (PSO);radio frequency (RF);resonant cavity antenna (RCA);wideband","Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Antennas;Shape;Probability distribution;Electromagnetics","","31","","46","IEEE","17 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite the apparent simplicity of the dielectric measurement process, reported data have been inconsistent for heterogeneous tissues. Dielectric properties may be attributed to heterogeneous tissues by identifying the tissue types that contributed to the measurement through histological analysis. However, accurate interpretation of the measurements with histological analysis requires first defining an appropriate histology region to examine. Here, we investigate multiple definitions for the probe sensing depth and uniquely calculate this parameter for measurements with a realistic range of tissues. We demonstrate that different sensing depth definitions are not equivalent, and may introduce error in dielectric data. Last, we propose an improved definition, given by the depth to which the probe can detect changes in the tissue sample, within the measurement uncertainty. We equate this sensing depth with histology depth, thus supporting the need of having the tissue region that contributes to the dielectric data be the same as that which is analyzed histologically. This paper demonstrates that, for these tissues, the histology depth is both frequency and tissue dependent. Therefore, the histology depth should be selected based on the measurement scenario; otherwise, inaccuracies in the data may result.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2741026","European Research Council under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Programme/ERC under Grant Agreement BioElecPro(grant numbers:n. 637780); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Irish Research Council New Foundations Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8012405","Biological materials;dielectric measurement;open-ended coaxial probe;tissue properties","Dielectric measurement;Dielectrics;Probes;Sensors;Frequency measurement;Permittivity;Biological tissues","","43","","31","IEEE","17 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the development of highly compact circuits, the isolation between each terminal of a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system becomes more and more important to reach high system accuracy. Here, we propose an innovative approach of decoupling for a dual-band MSA, in which the isolation is achieved through two kinds of transmission lines based on the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) and miniaturized spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP). Both SIW and SSPP transmission lines have been used in functional devices and could be considered as part of radio frequency front-end circuits. Using the proposed method, the isolation between two ports of MSA is achieved without occupying extra space. A prototype is fabricated on the basis of a triple-layer dual-band MSA, each port of which is connected to one of the novel transmission lines. Combining the perfectly high-pass SIW and low-pass SSPP, the proposed feeding network could provide broadband decoupling without influencing the property of the antenna. We show that the mutual coupling between two ports is decreased by almost 20 dB within a wide frequency band. Such a design could meet the needs in application of multiantenna or tunable system without further alteration in dimensions and has potential to play an important role in the future communication systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2742539","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631007,61571117); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013841","Decoupling;dual band;spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs);substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)","Ports (Computers);Substrates;Power transmission lines;Microstrip;Dual band;Antennas;Transmission line measurements","","68","","15","OAPA","21 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with a typical AVA with the same size, the proposed antenna has better impedance characteristics because of the amelioration introduced by the coupling between the two slots, as well as the more symmetric radiation patterns and the remarkably lowered cross-polarization level at the endfire direction. For validating the analysis, an UWB balun based on the double-sided parallel stripline is designed for realizing the excitation, and a sample of the proposed antenna is fabricated.

Due to the fact that sidelobes mainly arise from the edge diffractions, the reflecting elements can alter the phase distribution of induced currents along the edge boundary, and therefore reduce the sidelobes through the destructive cancellation of fields radiated from these elements. The desired phases are found through the implementation of pattern synthesis technique such as genetic algorithm to optimize the SLLs. This technique of edge current phase alternation may be employed, in conjunction with using a tapered feed radiation to illuminate the reflector, to control both amplitudes and phases of edge currents. Thus, the edge diffraction mechanism may be better controlled to optimize SLLs. In this communication, both resonant and nonresonant types of metallic elements are implemented and compared to illustrate their characteristics of radiations in SLL suppression. This technique is particularly useful to suppress the SLLs within a local angular region.

The main performance of the proposed structure is three Ka-bands spatial filtering with different polarized outputs in each passband which is achieved by combining of enhanced Jerusalem and Gangbuster surfaces based upon circular SIW cavities. The horizontal polarized incident waves enter the circular SIW cavities and excite their dominant modes. Then, the excited cavities emit horizontal and vertical polarized waves through the enhanced Jerusalem and Gangbuster slots on the opposite side of cavities. The proposed structure optimization and evaluation are performed by CST Microwave Studio. The compact size and sharp roll-off in stop bands are other advantages of the proposed structure.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2736527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8003348","Frequency-selective surface (FSS);polarization rotation;polarization separation;substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)","Frequency selective surfaces;Cavity resonators;Surface waves;Polarization;Substrates;Transmitting antennas","","12","","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It could be difficult to obtain accurate solutions for such a problem because the current density changes dramatically near the edges of such objects and many low-quality meshes exist on the side faces of objects when discretized. Traditionally, the electric field integral equation is used to describe the problem and the three-dimensional (3-D) objects are approximated as a two-dimensional (2-D) open structure with a summation of the current density at two opposite sides. In this communication, the magnetic field integral equation (MFIE) is employed to govern the problem and the super-thin objects are strictly treated as 3-D objects. The MFIE is a second-kind integral equation resulting in a better conditioning and can also release the low-frequency breakdown problem, but it has not been applied to very thin structures. In the method of moments solution, a robust near-singularity treatment for its kernel is developed based on the Green's lemma. The derived formulations are friendly and very suitable for low-quality triangular meshes. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the scheme and good results have been obtained.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2734161","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671328); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997948","Integral equation;method of moments (MoM);near-singularity;super-thin conducting object","Integral equations;Current density;Method of moments;Surface treatment;Robustness;Mathematical model;Antennas","","2","","28","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"On the Validity of an Analytical Solution for Characterizing Backscattering From Tree Trunks for FOPEN Sensing at $P$ -Band","D.

The formulation of interest here is from the volumetric current integration method, combined with a ray-based approach for the treatment of ground effects. Through comparisons with a reference solution provided by a full-wave solver, the region of validity of the closed-form approximate solution as a function of trunk length, trunk radius, incidence angle, and polarization is derived. Trunks with and without tapering along their lengths are considered. It is noted that, in general, the error behavior of the vv solution exhibits more complexity than that of the hh solution, due to the Brewster angle effects of the trunk and the ground; consequently, the hh solution is valid over a wider range of length and radius values. The backscattering signatures of the trunks are also examined in the imaging domain. It is found that the analytical solution can correctly predict the single ground-bounce returns but may not consistently capture other less prominent effects, such as scattering from the top of the trunk and higher order interactions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2734158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997926","Analytical method;electromagnetic scattering;foliage-penetration (FOPEN) radar imaging;tree scattering","Scattering;Backscatter;Vegetation;Dielectrics;Antennas;Analytical models;Radar imaging","","1","","18","USGov","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both the overset grid generation technique and the Lorentz transformation are employed in this method. By using the Lorentz transformation and the linear interpolation technique, the incident plane wave in the rest frame is introduced to the moving frame; the scattered fields are transformed from the moving frame to the rest frame. Numerical experiments validate the Lorentz-PITD method and show that the Lorentz-PITD method is more computationally efficient compared with the Lorentz finite-difference time-domain method. An accompanied find is that there must be a tradeoff between the applicable frequency range and the computation cost in the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2742540","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51677140); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013854","Electromagnetic scattering;lorentz transformation;moving target;precise integration time-domain (PITD) method","Finite difference methods;Time-domain analysis;Slabs;Antennas;Electromagnetic scattering;Interpolation","","5","","14","IEEE","21 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experiment results show that TOA distance measurement errors accord with Gaussian distribution, and its mean and variance are directly related with antenna height and communication distance. Based on the proposed TOA ranging error model, Cramer-Rao lower bound under typical scenarios have been calculated, and localization performance simulation has been studied.
