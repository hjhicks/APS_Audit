The antenna consists of two closely placed 3-D loops, two parasitic small loops, and a circular top hat. Two strip-shaped probes, each coupling with one loop, are used to feed the antenna in common mode. UWB operation is achieved by taking advantage of the magnetic coupling of the parallel-fed 3-D loops. Small electrical dimensions of the antenna are due to the special capacitive proximity feeding scheme and the presence of the top hat. A prototype with 4.1:1 bandwidth is designed, fabricated, and characterized. The antenna demonstrates a VSWR better than 2:1 and monopole-like omnidirectional radiation characteristics across this entire band. It occupies a cylindrical volume with a diameter of 0.14λmin and a height of 0.09λmin, where λmin is the free-space wavelength at the lowest frequency of operation. The antenna has a kmina = 0.73, where kmin is the wavenumber at its lowest frequency of operation. The fabricated prototype is demonstrated to have a lowest frequency of operation that is only 10% above the theoretical limits on UWB antennas.

We introduce a novel 3-D-printed polarizer, which consists of several air and dielectric slabs to transform the polarization of the antenna radiation from linear to circular. The proposed polarizer is placed above a radiating aperture operating at the center frequency of 60 GHz. An electric field, E, radiated from the aperture generates two components of electric fields, Ex and Ey . After passing through the polarizer, both Ex and Ey fields can be degenerated with an orthogonal phase difference which results in having a wide axial ratio bandwidth. The phase difference between Ex and Ey is determined by the incident angle φ, of the polarization of the electric field to the polarizer as well as the thickness, h, of the dielectric slabs. With the help of the thickness of the polarizer, the directivity of the radiation pattern is increased so as to devote high-gain and wideband characteristics to the antenna. To verify our concept, an intensive parametric study and an experiment were carried out. Three antenna sources, including dipole, patch, and aperture antennas, were investigated with the proposed 3-D-printed polarizer. All measured results agree with the theoretical analysis. The proposed antenna with the polarizer achieves a wide impedance bandwidth of 50% from 45 to 75 GHz for the reflection coefficient less than or equal -10 dB, and yields an overlapped axial ratio bandwidth of 30% from 49 to 67 GHz for the axial ratio ≤ 3 dB. The maximum gain of the antenna reaches to 15 dBic. The proposed methodology of this design can apply to applications related to mmw wireless communication systems.

Based on the cavity model for a square MPA, the TM10 and TM30 modes as well as both higher odd-order and even-order modes between them can be characterized. In order to combine the dual radiative resonant modes for a wide impedance bandwidth, a rectangular radiating patch with an aperture-coupled feeder is employed and theoretically investigated at first, aiming to demonstrate that all of the undesired modes between them can be removed effectively. After that, by loading the shorting pins properly underneath the patch, the resonant frequency of TM10 mode is shown to progressively turn up with slight effect on that of TM30 mode. As a result, these two radiative modes can be allocated in proximity to each other, resulting in a wide impedance bandwidth with a stable radiation pattern and the same far-field polarization. Moreover, the principal parameters of the MPA have been extensively studied in order to investigate the sensitivity in input impedance of the aperture-fed patch antenna. Finally, the proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. Simulated and measured results are found in good agreement with each other and illustrate that the antenna achieves a wide impedance bandwidth of about 15.2% in fraction or 2.32-2.70 GHz under |S11| <; -10 dB, while keeping a low profile property with the height of 0.032 free-space wavelength.

An array of vias on the narrow wall produces leakage through excitation of TE10 fast-wave mode of the waveguide. Attenuation and phase constants of the leaky mode are controlled independently to obtain desired pattern in the elevation. In the azimuth, top and bottom layers radiate independently, producing symmetrically located beams on both sides of broadside. A new near-field analysis of single LWA is performed to determine wavenumbers and as a way to anticipate radiation characteristics of the dual layer antenna. In addition to frequency beam steering in the elevation plane, this novel topology also offers flexibility for multispot illumination of the azimuth plane with flat-topped beams at every φ-cut through excitation of each layer separately or both antennas simultaneously. It is shown that the proposed antenna solution is a qualified candidate for 5G base station antenna (BSA) applications due to its capability of interference mitigation and latency reduction.

The antenna size, available space for antennas, mutual coupling between antennas and acceptable hardware complexity (switching and processing) limit the usable number of antennas. To address this issue, the concept of virtual array is utilized. In this regard, a spatial interpolator is designed to predict the received signals at the location of the virtual elements using the recorded signals by a limited number of real antennas. Consequently, a frequency-based imaging algorithm is used to process the virtual-array signals and produce clear images that enable accurate detection. The presented method is tested via simulations and experiments using a multistatic-radar-based head imaging system operating using the band 1.1-3.2 GHz. The data recorded by eight antennas around the head is used to form equivalent data from an extended virtual array of 12, 16, and 32 elements. Using quantitative metrics, it is shown that the constructed images from the extended virtual array are more accurate than the images created only from the real antennas. It is also shown that a virtual array that has twice the number of elements of the real array, which meet the minimum limit of degree-of-freedom of the problem, is enough to generate an accurate image with optimized computational resources. In comparison with existing correlation-based methods, the presented approach provides more accurate images.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2647584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805247","Head imaging;microwave imaging;multistatic radar;spatial statistics;virtual array","Microwave imaging;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave antenna arrays;Correlation;Head","","26","","35","IEEE","4 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In general, full-wave simulations are used to derive this curve, though recently a number of analytical techniques have emerged based on equivalent circuit models (ECMs). However, most ECMs are cumbersome to employ, either because they are too specialized or they depend on extraction of component values from supplementary simulations. This paper presents a fully analytical method for predicting the S-curve from dipole-like reflectarray elements based on an ECM derived from a Floquet modal expansion of a planar dipole. The model does not need supplementary simulations that can be used to predict the co-polarized reflection coefficient from a variety of fixed and reconfigurable reflectarray elements. The model is validated against full-wave simulations for several reflectarray element types, including fixed patches, varactor-loaded patches, and patches on tunable substrates, and is shown to be accurate. As such, it could become a highly useful design tool for quickly deriving the S-curve of reflectarray elements during the initial design stages of reflectarrays.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2657483","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7831464","Equivalent circuits;microstrip arrays;reconfigurable antennas;reflectarrays;varactors","Manganese;Integrated circuit modeling;Analytical models;Impedance;Equivalent circuits;Computer architecture;Microprocessors","","20","","34","IEEE","24 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, electromagnetic wave scattering occurs at the discontinuity of the propagation path, such as the edge of a scatterer. In this paper, the edge scattering from a triangular object is largely reduced by patterning the triangular surface with inhomogeneous and anisotropic impedance surface. Because surface waves propagate toward the direction with the lower surface refractive index on an anisotropic surface, the direction of the wave propagation can be controlled by designing the distribution of the refractive index. Consequently, the proposed anisotropic impedance surfaces can make the current flows toward or away from the edge so that the edge scattering can be reduced or redirected to a different angle. For demonstration, anisotropic unit cells are analyzed and designed. Also, the anisotropic impedance surfaces are simulated, fabricated, and measured. Here we propose two types of impedance profiles, which are capable of changing the surface current direction either toward or away from the scattering edge. The experimental measurement demonstrates a 7-10 dB edge scattering reduction.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2647681","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-16-1-0093); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Project(grant numbers:61271048,61331002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805151","Anisotropic surface impedance;electromagnetic metamaterials;metasurface;radar cross sections (RCSs);scattering","Surface impedance;Surface waves;Impedance;Scattering;Optical surface waves;Artificial intelligence;Dispersion","","17","","33","IEEE","4 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The greatest challenge of the WBAN channel modeling is that the antennas operate in proximity to the human body. Near-field interactions between the antenna and the human body make it difficult to distinguish the contribution of the antennas within the channel response, i.e., the antennas are embedded in the channel. As a result, the characterized channels had to be always specific to the given antenna, and antenna optimization is difficult. Therefore, this paper proposed antenna deembedding by applying the spherical wave function channel modeling into the on-body channel. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was utilized to implement the concept. The proposed implementation was validated against the conventional antenna-embedded simulation. Furthermore, the antenna performance evaluation in terms of mean path gain during a specific body motion was demonstrated as an application.

While the propagation environment can be discretized and represented in detail, the representation of radiating sources (such as transmitting antennas) requires the calculation, analytical if possible or numerical via another method such as ray-tracing (RT), of the fields that the sources generate on the initial plane of the VPE model. These initial conditions are necessary for subsequently applying VPE. However, the solutions offered so far compromise either the accuracy or the efficiency of VPE. For example, generating the initial conditions for VPE through RT adds significant computational overhead to the typically fast VPE solver. To address this significant limitation of VPE methods, we introduce a technique that allows one to directly embed antennas into a VPE mesh, via a Gaussian beam approximation of their radiated fields. Hence, the initial conditions for VPE are generated for practical antenna patterns, without invoking other techniques and with no compromise on the inherent efficiency of VPE. Concrete guidelines on how to choose parameters for Gaussian beams are provided. Numerical results are compared to experimental measurements in various tunnel scenarios, demonstrating the validity and usefulness of the technique.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2647589","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Thales Canada through a Strategic Project Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805235","Antenna field pattern synthesis;Gaussian beam approximation;parabolic equation method;wave propagation modeling","Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Ray tracing;Numerical models;Antenna radiation patterns;Wireless communication","","40","","35","IEEE","4 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A previously developed model chain for DS link-budget optimization, based on numerical weather forecasts (WFs), is adopted. The latter, already tested at Ka-band, exploits the combination of a high-resolution mesoscale forecast model and a radiative transfer model to predict the atmospheric scenario and optimize received data volume (DV) during DS transmissions. To shift available Ka-band results to other frequencies, we apply frequency-scaling laws to extrapolate forecast path attenuation, link parameters, and maximum allowed bit-rate for data transmission. Exploiting the available WF-based methodology, we compute DV return for DS missions operating at X-, K-, Ka-, Q-, and W-bands in order to make a comparative study of the behavior of DS transmission-channels at these frequencies. Results show that, in terms of received DV, an innovative WF-based approach is more convenient than traditional methodologies and exhibits a trend similar to the benchmark (ideal case). Increasing link frequency, received DV increases up to Q-band.

This paper proposes two novel approaches able to provide accurate solutions, including at the endfire regions of the array. First, a Bayesian compressive sensing Kalman filter is developed, which accounts for the predicted estimated signals rather than using the traditional sparse prior. The posterior probability density function of the received source signals and the expression for the related marginal likelihood function are derived theoretically. Next, a Gibbs sampling-based approach with indicator variables in the sparsity prior is developed. This allows sparsity to be explicitly enforced in different ways, including when an angle is too far from the previous estimate. The proposed approaches are validated and evaluated over different test scenarios and compared to the traditional relevance vector machine (RVM)-based method. An improved accuracy in terms of average root-mean-square error values is achieved (up to 73.39% for the modified RVM-based approach and 86.36% for the Gibbs sampling-based approach). The proposed approaches prove to be particularly useful for DOA estimation when the angle of arrival moves into the endfire region of the array.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2655013","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the project Bayesian Tracking and Reasoning over Time(grant numbers:EP/K021516/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839908","Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS);dynamic direction of arrival (DOA) estimation;Gibbs sampling;Kalman filter (KF);relevance vector machine (RVM)","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Mutual coupling;Estimation;Antennas;Compressed sensing;Bayes methods;Support vector machines","","30","","34","CCBY","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the measurement of MIMO-SAR is complex and time consuming. In this communication, six unique dual-antenna mobile handsets, including both typical and novel designs, are analyzed to determine the dependence of MIMO-SAR on antenna configuration and correlation. It is found that, for certain antenna configurations, the location of the maximum MIMO-SAR and the corresponding relative phase between the ports can be predicted. This can be applied to drastically reduce measurement time. In addition, dual antennas with low envelope correlation coefficients in the radiation patterns also offer near-orthogonal electric near fields. This leads to smaller MIMO-SAR than stand-alone SAR (S-SAR) over all relative phases, making MIMO-SAR measurement unnecessary. The results also provide guidelines for designing multi-antenna handsets with low SARs. For verification, the S-SAR and MIMO-SAR at a relative phase of 0° were measured for several prototypes. The measured SAR distributions showed good agreement with the simulated ones.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2647708","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601079); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT15RC(3)063); Swedish Research Council(grant numbers:2010-468); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809073","Mobile antenna;multi-antennas;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);specific absorption rate (SAR)","Antennas;Prototypes;Antenna measurements;MIMO;Phantoms;Time measurement;Mobile communication","","30","","16","IEEE","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
