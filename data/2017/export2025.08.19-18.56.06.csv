In addition, a substrate-integrated cavity is employed to suppress the surface wave and improve the radiation efficiency. A differential feeding network is used in the design to improve the symmetry of the E-plane radiation pattern and the H-plane cross polarization. A 2 × 2 prototype is designed, fabricated, and measured for a demonstration. The measured results show that the prototype has a 10 dB impedance bandwidth of 34.4%, a gain of around 12.5 dBi with a narrow E-plane radiation beam within 37.5-46 GHz for long distance applications, and a gain of around 8 dBi with a broad E-plane radiation beam within 47-53 GHz for short distance applications.

The antenna consists of a cavity reflector, two pairs of vertical and horizontal copper plates, and a crossed  $\Gamma $ -shaped feeding structure. The shorted vertical plates work as quasi-magnetic dipoles (M-dipoles), while the connected horizontal plates work as electric dipoles (E-dipoles). Two M-dipoles and E-dipoles are designed to possess different heights and lengths, and thus they are able to achieve separate operation bands. To generate dual-sense CP performance, the M-dipoles and E-dipoles are placed in parallel and the adjacent E-dipoles extend along the opposite directions. Benefiting from the intrinsic 90° phase difference between the M-dipole and E-dipole, the left-hand CP is achieved within the lower operation band (2.15–3.4 GHz) and the right-hand CP is achieved within the upper band (4–6.3 GHz). The proposed antenna possesses a unidirectional radiation pattern with high front-to-back ratio ( $\ge 22$  dB).

A higher directivity in a small antenna is closely connected with a narrow impedance bandwidth. The relation between bandwidth and a desired directivity is still not fully understood, not even for small antennas. Initial investigations in this direction have related the radius of a circumscribing sphere to the directivity, and bounds on the Q-factor have also been derived for a partial directivity in a given direction. In this paper, we derive lower bounds on the Q-factor for a total desired directivity for an arbitrarily shaped antenna in a given direction as a convex problem using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. We also show that the relaxed solution is also a solution of the original problem of determining the lower Q-factor bound for a total desired directivity. SDR can also be used to relax a class of other interesting nonconvex constraints in antenna optimization, such as tuning, losses, and front-to-back ratio. We compare two different new methods to determine the lowest Q-factor for arbitrary-shaped antennas for a given total directivity.

Compared with conventional dipoles in free space, the length of the proposed dipole is compressed although the currents on the compressed dipole still sinusoidally distribute. The traces of calculated compressed dipole's directivity against compressibility show that the directivity of a compressed dipole operating at higher resonant modes is larger than conventional dipoles for the well selected compressibility. This paper shows that printing the dipole onto a piece of dielectric substrate can achieve the desired compressibility. The relationship between the compressibility and relative permittivity of the dielectric slab provides the guidance to realize the selected compressibility. As an example, a thin linear compressed dipole resonating at the third mode is designed, fabricated, and measured to validate the method. The measured broadside gain of the proposed compressed dipole reaches up to 4.6 dBi, 75% or 2.45 dBi higher than a conventional dipole.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2748385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8023881","Beamwidth;compressed;dipole;gain;phase constant","Dipole antennas;Substrates;Antenna measurements;Antenna radiation patterns;Dielectric substrates;Permittivity;Current distribution","","44","","9","IEEE","1 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Gain-Enhanced Patch Antenna Without Enlarged Size via Loading of Slot and Shorting Pins","X. Zhang; L.

At first, a straight slot is transversely introduced in the central line of a patch. For the dominant TM01 mode, this central line behaves as a virtual electric wall with zero electric field and maximum surface current underneath and on the patch, respectively. By doing so, the central slot serves as an extra radiator so that this slot-loaded patch produces radiation as an equivalent three-slot array. Meanwhile, a pair of shorting pins is longitudinally placed at the two symmetrical sides of this central slot to maintain the resonant frequency. Due to the out of phase between the electric fields in the central slot and two sided slots, the far-field radiated by the three slots can be canceled with each other in specific directions away from broadside. Thus, this cancellation results in sidelobe of low level in the E-plane due to emergence of radiation nulls, and further makes the main radiation beam more directionally selective. Accordingly, the directivity and gain of this proposed patch antenna are enhanced with no need of enlarging the overall size of patch. Finally, the simulated and measured results are provided to validate the operating principle and show that the directivity is increased by about 1.7 dB increment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2751658","National Natural Science Foundation of China under General Program(grant numbers:61571468); University of Macau under Multi-Year Research(grant numbers:MYRG2015-00010-FST,MYRG2014-00079-FST); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under FDCT Research(grant numbers:051/2014/A1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8036210","High gain;patch antenna;shorting pins;slot","Patch antennas;Pins;Electric fields;Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Loading","","70","","18","IEEE","13 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the method has no restrictions on the near field, it allows us to alter the polarization currents distribution in order to obtain a better far-field performance for a periodic structure with a given unit cell size. The method also allows us to perform a simple parametric study on the limits of the unit cell size, taking into account the scatterer geometrical dimensions. This parameter (unit cell size) does not appear in the formulation if we use a method that assumes an infinite array of cylinders. The realization is done using the multiple scattering method, which is one of the most accurate methods to deal with arrays scattering.

Due to the profound physical insights provided by an NCM, a desired antenna performance can be achieved by properly manipulating the modes through reactive loading at specified ports. This paper presents a new matching technique for an N-port internally loaded small antenna. By combining the NCM with the differential evolution algorithm, optimal reactive load values can be calculated. These loads can manipulate the NCMs to match the antenna in a desired bandwidth. Unlike other matching techniques based on the NCM, the desired bandwidth is achieved through internal reactive loading without the need for an input matching network. Two examples of electrically small monopole antennas are studies. In both examples, we study the possibility to match the antennas in the GSM 900 band, and we further investigate the possibility to achieve wider bandwidths by varying the number of ports and the loading topologies based on the interpretation of the characteristic modes. The loaded antennas are wideband with a relatively stable radiation pattern and an efficiency higher than 90%.

Since the ultimate goal is to obtain an impedance model from which to derive the best matching network; the input impedance is expressed in a form that has a frequency independent resistor terminating a reactive network which is called the Darlington form. Because such a circuit mimics closely the input impedance of the dipole modes of the spherical mode expansion, it is a much better model of the antennas as we go beyond the electrically small limit.

The SNR maximization may produce high sidelobe levels, making the receiver vulnerable to interferences. We consider the problem of achieving maximum SNR beamforming subject to specified quiescent pattern constraints and, as such, combine both adaptive and deterministic approaches for sparse array configurations.

They may dramatically reduce the cost without significantly sacrificing the radiation performance. In this technique, the RF devices to feed antenna elements are subdivided into groups for modularization. Each module is formed by very few elements of RF devices to form a multilevel BFN, where the number of RF elements in each module are the integer factors of array size. Each module at the same layer consists of identical RF structures to minimize the mass manufacture cost. In this paper, the theoretical foundation is developed to provide design guidelines.

In this paper, we study the antenna loss and receiving efficiency for phased array antennas and focal plane phased array feeds. To better elucidate the physics of array antenna loss related to mutual coupling and beamformer weights, losses for a coupled array can be lumped into an array effective resistance similar to the loss resistance of an equivalent single antenna. Numerical results show that although the antenna loss for a single isolated array element is low, the array antenna loss can be significantly increased by mutual coupling, particularly for beams with a large scan angle.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2748237","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1309832); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8024005","Array effective resistance;mutual coupling;phased array antennas;phased array feeds;receiving efficiency;scanned beams","Receiving antennas;Phased arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Resistance;Loaded antennas","","14","","16","USGov","1 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the square-loop ECM, there is no formulation to quantify the effects of dielectric supporting layers, geometric features, and incident wave properties on the FSS bandwidth. Hence, it is not possible to control or evaluate the bandwidth of the FSS in the design from the knowledge of these parameters. In this paper, we addressed this issue using the ECM as an analysis method. In the first part of this study, we considered the square-loop FSS with thin dielectric supporting layers, where the bandwidth was expressed as a function of geometric parameters, incidence angle, and polarization of the incident wave as well as a factor that takes into account the effective permittivity of the dielectric support. Particle swarm optimization method was used to synthesize square-loop FSSs via the ECM with a specific resonant frequency and bandwidth requirements. In the second part, the behavior of bandwidth as a function of dielectric thickness was obtained by using a matrix cascading technique (MCT), implemented with ECM and a model for the dielectric effective permittivity. This approach takes into account the modifications on bandwidth due to multiple reflections on dielectric boundaries and allows calculating its value for any dielectric thickness and configuration. It is remarkable the low computational cost and acceptable accuracy obtained with the proposed approaches.

In this paper, particles are modeled discretizing their volume with cells according to their weighted contents. The approach to FIM presented in this paper represents a departure from earlier work where the numerical integration is no longer based on expansion in a set of polynomials but on direct spatial integration. This approach which still involves contour integration method uses quandrantal contour in combination with a conditioning weighting function to control the magnitude of the integrand due to the power of the radial variable in the integrand being odd. The strength of our approach lies on the fact that computations are performed in the spatial frequency domain. As a result, the angular scattering pattern is strongly connected to the spatial Fourier transform of the scatterer; hence, for electrically small particles the angular spectrum is relatively smooth and the number of pivots required for integration is relatively low. This technique is well suited to the treatment of scattering from irregular inhomogeneous dielectric particles since only the distribution in space of the dielectric constants needs to be defined. Numerical results also confirm the inadequacy of effective medium theories in evaluating scattering characteristics of inhomogeneous particles.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2751649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8036266","Born terms;discretization;effective medium thoeries;inhomogeneous medium","Scattering;Nonhomogeneous media;Integral equations;Dielectric constant;Mathematical model;Antennas","","3","","41","IEEE","13 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These methods, which are developed from the Lawson method, remove the stiffness on the time explicit integration of the semidiscrete operator associated with the fine part of the mesh, and allow for the use of high-order time explicit scheme for the coarse part operator. They combine excellent stability properties with the ability to obtain very accurate solutions even for very large time step sizes. Here, the explicit time integration of the Lawson-transformed semidiscrete system relies on a low-storage Runge-Kutta (LSRK) scheme, leading to a combined Lawson-LSRK scheme. In addition, efficient techniques are presented to further improve the efficiency of this exponential-based time integration. For the efficient calculation of matrix exponential, we employ the Krylov subspace method. Numerical experiments are presented to assess the stability, verify the accuracy, and numerical convergence of the Lawson-LSRK scheme. They also demonstrate that the DG time-domain methods based on the proposed time integration scheme can be much faster than those based on classical fully explicit time stepping schemes, with the same accuracy and moderate memory usage increase on locally refined unstructured meshes, and are thus very promising for modeling 3-D multiscale electromagnetic problems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2752223","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61301054); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038082","Discontinuous Galerkin time-domain method;exponential time integration;Krylov subspace method;Lawson method;locally refined unstructured meshes;multiscale problems;time-domain Maxwell’s equations","Time-domain analysis;Numerical stability;Stability analysis;Maxwell equations;Finite element analysis;Antennas","","18","","48","IEEE","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The operating frequency was 19.68 GHz, elevation angles were between 21.7° and 22°, and site separations 23, 29.7, and 50.1 km. Due to the spatial decorrelation of rain, simultaneous attenuation at all sites occurs much less frequently than at a single site. All three two-site diversity combinations and a three-site diversity combination were investigated. Measured values for diversity gain at 0.01% exceedance level were 8.8, 10.7, and 12.1 dB for the two-site pairs and 12.5 dB for three sites, given a single-site attenuation level between 13 and 16 dB. Comparison of the measured data showed excellent agreement with the current ITU-R model. Fade duration statistics for single site and for the combinations are analyzed, and it is shown that the statistics for the diversity combinations can be modeled using a double-lognormal function as is the case for single-site statistics. Analysis of the effects of a nonperfect switch-over scheme showed that using moderate switch-over threshold levels and time delays, the number of switchovers can be significantly reduced while most of the diversity gain and reduction in number of fades are retained.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2751667","ESA(grant numbers:4000106010/12/NL/CLP); “Ka-band radio characterization for SatCom services in arctic and high latitude regions.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8036227","Radiowave propagation;satellite;spatial diversity","Attenuation;Rain;Antenna measurements;Diversity methods;Sea measurements;Satellites;Switches","","13","","22","IEEE","13 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, conventional regularization techniques used to solve the ill-posed inverse problem typically result in blurred boundaries between tissue structures exhibiting dielectric contrast, thereby limiting the effective resolution. We present a method to improve microwave breast imaging resolution that incorporates a priori information about the boundaries between different tissues in the breast into the inverse scattering algorithm. This spatial prior information can be derived from another imaging modality, such as magnetic resonance imaging. Our method exploits the fact that the dielectric properties within a tissue type exhibit low to moderate variability by favoring solutions to the inverse scattering problem, which have small variations in dielectric properties within each tissue region. The amount of variation tolerated in each regions is controlled by a spatial prior constraint parameter. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by imaging detailed, anatomically inspired numerical 3-D breast phantoms. The performance in the presence of different levels of noise and for different choices of the constraint parameter is evaluated.

The clusters were estimated based on the indoor environment geometry at 11 GHz, and their physical mechanisms were interpreted. The complexity and performance of this method was assessed and compared with that of conventional KPM by comparing the number of floating point operations (FLOPS) and the channel eigenvalues obtained from the reconstructed channel matrices, which were calculated by superposing the MPCs randomly generated from intracluster parameters. The verification of this method showed that most clusters were estimated and tracked according to the physical location of the scatterers in the environment with acceptable error. Moreover, the eigenvalues reconstructed from the proposed method were closer to the measured ones with less number of FLOPS, which indicates both accuracy and complexity improvement.

Using them for the case of weak, or even moderate diffuse scattering that is characterized by Rα≲ 1 would lead to an incorrect result. At the same time, for practical applications, it is important to describe the transition from partially coherent scattering to completely noncoherent, strong diffuse scattering in terms of the bistatic radar cross section σ0. This situation may occur for scattering of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals or other signals of opportunity from a rough ocean surface under weak winds, or from ice. In this paper, we obtain an expression for σ0 for the case of weak-to-moderate diffuse scattering using a formulation based on the small slope approximation of the first order. For a reasonable range of Ra, calculations can be quickly performed using standard desktop computers. We demonstrate results of such calculations for bistatic radar scattering for L-band at low-to-moderate Ra and its transition to σ0 at large values of Rα.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2752219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038084","Radar cross section;radar scattering;rough surfaces;sea surface electromagnetic scattering","Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Sea surface;Surface waves;Electromagnetic scattering","","41","","16","USGov","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The extinction cross sections of tens of GFs, with different sizes and various levels of crumpleness, were calculated using multiple independent solvers. The results show that resonances in the extinction cross section spectrum decrease in amplitude as the GFs become more crumpled. Moreover, some crumpled GFs exhibited a broader resonance than that of perfectly flat GFs. To explain these results, we used a characteristic mode analysis to decompose the graphene surface currents into a set of fundamental currents or modes. For perfectly flat square GFs, the vertical and horizontal modes were found to overlap and resonate at the same frequencies. However, as the GFs became more crumpled, the horizontal/vertical symmetry broke down causing the corresponding modes to separate and resonate at different frequencies leading to an overall broader bandwidth. These results attest to the importance of modeling the exact shape of GFs to accurately characterize their electromagnetic response.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2752218","NIST “Multi-Scale Computational Modeling of Carbon Nanostructure Composites”(grant numbers:70NANB15H285); NIST Project “Carbon Nanocomposite Manufacturing: Processing, Properties, Performance,”; NSF CRI ‘II-NEW: Experimental Characterization and CAD Development Testbed for Nanoscale Integrated Circuits.”(grant numbers:1629908); NIST(grant numbers:70NANB13H202,70NANB15H282); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038039","Characteristic mode analysis (CMA);crumpled;electromagnetic response;graphene flakes (GFs)","Graphene;Shape;Conductivity;Surface impedance;Electromagnetic scattering;Resonant frequency","","15","","47","USGov","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A rail scenario presents a potentially demanding use case for an EBD, as fast moving trains in the vicinity of the antenna may cause dynamically changing reflections, which can be received as self-interference. In this paper, measured dynamic antenna reflection coefficients at 745 and 1900 MHz from train mounted antennas are included in the EBD circuit simulations in order to investigate the resulting variation in Tx-Rx isolation, and determine requirements for balancing impedance adaptation.

In general, one of the most efficient conditions for energy beamforming is that the magnetic fields induced by each antenna should be synthesized to head the same direction. To synthesize the magnetic fields induced at each antenna, interference by mutual inductance that can occur between transmitting (TX) antennas should be minimized. In addition, energy should not be exchanged between the TXs, otherwise it lowers the transmission efficiencies of TX and receiving antenna. In this paper, we present an optimal antenna structure that minimizes the mutual inductance between two TX antennas. First, we have analyzed the mutual inductance between TX antennas that have asymmetric sizes with different antenna lengths and arrangement angles. The directivity of the magnetic field vector is also investigated through an experimental analysis of an antenna structure. Finally, it has been verified that the optimal TX antennas for energy beamforming should be symmetric, which means that all the length of antennas are same and disposed perpendicular to each other. The experimental results show that the deviations of magnetic field directivity for symmetric and asymmetric antennas are 0.045 and 0.355, respectively, which shows that the symmetric structure shows 8.2 times larger consistency over the asymmetric structure.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2754326","Korea Government (MSIP) through the National Research Foundation(grant numbers:2016R1A2B4015329); Korea Government (MSIT) through IT Research and Development Program of IITP(grant numbers:R-20160222-002757); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8046032","Beamforming antenna;energy beamforming;magnetic field shaping;wireless power antenna;wireless power transfer (WPT)","Wires;Inductance;Array signal processing;Magnetic fields;Transmitting antennas;Mathematical model","","14","","18","IEEE","19 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is commonly adapted to achieve a favorable angular resolution for this broad beam antenna. However, the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is always troubled by the frequently occurring distortion of antenna pattern. Previous studies are mainly focused on the calibration by using the actual pattern or other assistant algorithms. In this paper, theoretical analysis is made to illustrate the reason for pattern distortion, which draws a conclusion that the distortion is essentially due to the different influence of environmental obstacles upon the electric field part and magnetic field part. This also implies that there is nearly no distortion between the two loops, which is validated by three different experiments. Based on this conclusion, the DOA estimation performance of the MUSIC algorithm is studied by creating a numerical relationship associating the estimation error with distortion level. Furthermore, a new method using ideal pattern is proposed to improve the estimation performance by removing the amplitude information of monopole and relying on the CL processing.

Provided the availability of mathematical expressions for the cumulative distribution function and probability density function of received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), performance can then be analytically studied via the diversity antenna gain (DAG) in terms of: 1) SNR enhancement at a specific outage probability (OP) level (that is DAG-OP) and 2) average SNR reduction for achieving a specific average bit error rate (BER) (that is DAG-BER).

The proposed reflectarray operates in two separated broad frequency bands within  $X$ - and  $K$ -bands. The reflectarray element consists of a circular patch surrounded by a microstrip ring. Two curved phase delay lines are attached to the patch and two curved phase delay lines are attached to the ring. The ring and patch are designed for the operation at  $X$ - and  $K$ -bands, respectively. Phase delay lines attached to the ring are spatially rotated by 90° with respect to the delay lines attached to the patch. This produces a linear polarization at  $X$ -band, which is perpendicular to the linear polarization produced at  $K$ -band. This also provides a high polarization isolation, which enables by adjusting the phase of the elements at each band independent of the phase at the other bands. At both operation bands, the required phase shifts are obtained by varying the lengths of the phase delay lines. The proposed element provides more than 450° linear phase range over the bands 8.7–10.7 GHz ( $X$ -band) and 18–20.4 GHz ( $K$ -band). Measurement results show the maximum gain of 27.7 dB at 9.7 GHz with 25% 1 dB gain bandwidth and the maximum gain of 31.8 dB at 19.2 GHz with 18% 1 dB gain bandwidth. By proper arrangement of the elements in the array, the cross polarization is reduced.
