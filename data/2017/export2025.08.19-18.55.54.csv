The reconfigurability is achieved by integrating an active frequency selective surface (AFSS) with feed antenna. The smart FSS comprises a printed slot array loaded by varactors. A novel dc biasing arrangement is proposed to feed the slots vertically so that the unwanted effects caused by bias lines are minimized. A monopole antenna is designed to illuminate the AFSS. The resulting structure can operate in a frequency tuning range of 30%. By reconfiguring the different sections of active FSS cylinder into a transparent or reflector mode, the omnidirectional pattern of the source antenna can be converted to a directive beam. As an illustration, half of the AFSS cylinder is successively biased, enabling the beam switching to cover the entire horizontal plane over a range of frequencies. An antenna prototype was fabricated and measured. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of providing useful gain levels and good impedance matching from 1.7 to 2.3 GHz. The antenna offers a low-cost, low-power solution for wireless systems that require frequency and beam reconfigurable antennas.

Unlike the conventional donut-shaped pattern of a quarter-wavelength monopole antenna, one-beam and multiple-beam patterns are obtained using a genetic-algorithm-based optimization. Different dielectric constant spatial distributions are realized by changing the ratio of the dielectric to air at the unit cell level in the entire antenna volume.

The antenna comprises a base-fed monopole wherein, a portion of the outer conductor is extended to create a reflector that directs the fields toward the opposing direction. To further direct the fields away from the reflector, we etched a semicylindrical slot in the outer conductor. The electric field produced by the slot constructively interferes with the field generated by the monopole in the desired radiation direction, while destructively interfering with the monopole's field behind the reflector. This creates directional specific absorption rate and heating patterns. In addition, the reflector and slot suppress the unwanted currents along the antennas feeding cable. This eliminates the need for a balun and reduces the overall antenna diameter. The antenna is impedance matched using an internal π-matching network.

We propose a mesh deformation scheme, which allows the use of a single FEM mesh for computing ensemble averaged quantities. This scheme is used to perform Monte Carlo (MC) iterations, which is much faster than the conventional techniques where a different mesh is utilized for each surface instance. This scheme also allows for MC-free formulations of the problem; in the first kind, we expand the solution in a stochastic basis using the concept of generalized polynomial chaos obtaining ensemble averaged quantities. This results in a larger set of equations that need to be solved just once. In the second kind -the stochastic collocation method-we run the deterministic solver at certain specified points in the random domain corresponding to the rough surface description.

A Wideband CP Crossed Slot Antenna Using 1- $\lambda $ Resonant Mode With Single Feeding,C. F. Zhou; S. W.

The impedance of a simple slot radiator is studied using computer simulation. Since operating the slot radiator in the 1-λ resonant mode requires a longer slot length, a large square slot is used at both ends of the slot to reduce the required slot length. The results of the study are subsequently used to design a wideband circularly polarized (CP) crossed slot antenna (CSA) with single feeding. The CSA consists of two slot radiators having the same length and placed in a crossed shape, i.e., orthogonal positions. A single microstrip line with a via at the end is used to feed the CSA. By loading reactive elements with appropriate values on each slot near to the feed line, the two slots generate two linearly polarized electric fields with 90°-phase difference for CP operation. The CSA is studied and designed using simulation and measurement. Measured results show that the CSA has a wide impedance bandwidth of 1.52-3.44 GHz (1.92 GHz, 77.4%) and axial-ratio bandwidth of 1.73-3.01 GHz (1.28 GHz, 54%), much wider than the previous directional and bidirectional CSAs using single feeding.",1558-2221,,10.1109/TAP.2017.2708101,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933988,1-λ resonant mode;crossed slot with square ends;reactive component;wideband circularly polarized (CP) antenna,Bandwidth;Impedance;Slot antennas;Microstrip;Antenna feeds;Resonant frequency,,31,,23,IEEE,25 May 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The appropriate adjustment of coupled-line sections in such a directional filter allows for flexible selection of transmission coefficients between two outputs, and therefore, can be used for gradual switching of the signals between radiating elements. The proposed frequency-selective feeding network has been applied in a six-element antenna array operating in 1.75-3.5 GHz frequency range in which constant beamwidth around 16° has been achieved.",1558-2221,,10.1109/TAP.2017.2717962,"National Science Center through SONATA Program(grant numbers:DEC-2011/03/D/ST7/01783); statutory activity of the Department of Electronics AGH; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7954726,Antenna feeding networks;broadband antenna arrays;frequency-selective networks;microstrip antenna arrays,Broadband antennas;Antenna feeds;Microstrip antenna arrays;Directive antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Switches,,10,,10,IEEE,21 Jun 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

A lossless and two lossy resonators are employed in the unit cell of the periodic structure to produce the passband and the absorption bands, respectively. Utilizing the techniques of stepped impedance resonator and capacitor loading, the thickness of the resonators is reduced. Moreover, the capacitor loading also frees the tuning of each resonant frequency of the lossy resonator, which facilitates the FSR design. The multiresonances of the lossy resonators are also employed to obtain a wide upper absorption band. An equivalent circuit model is established for understanding the operating principle. A prototype of the proposed FSR is fabricated and measured.

The large time complexity of the SMT is reduced by deriving an implicit compact representation of the scattering problem via a fast multipole formulation, which divides the interactions into far and near ones while grouping and approximating the far interactions. This results in significant acceleration of classical SMT, which is demonstrated in a variety of 3-D many-body scattering problems.

Spherical Wave Expansion With Arbitrary Origin for Near-Field Antenna Measurements,R. Cornelius; D. Heberling,"Institute of High Frequency Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany; Institute of High Frequency Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,3 Aug 2017,2017,65,8,4385,4388,"The far-field radiation pattern of an antenna under test (AUT) can be derived via a spherical wave expansion of near-field antenna measurement data. The transformation as well as the measurement time scales with the number of spherical mode coefficients which depends on the radius of the sphere enclosing the antenna. In existing transformation procedures, the radius is measured from the center of the measurement sphere. Thus, the radius increases for an offset-mounted antenna so that more spherical mode coefficients are required to represent the electromagnetic field. In this communication, a procedure is proposed where the origin of the spherical wave expansion can be specified independently of the measurement sphere. With this procedure, the number of coefficients can always be minimized by selecting an expansion origin that minimizes the sphere enclosing the AUT. A translated expansion origin requires to include the probe pointing direction in the probe response constant calculation. This is achieved by Euler rotations of the probe receiving coefficients. The benefits of the procedure are demonstrated by measurements of an offset-mounted AUT.",1558-2221,,10.1109/TAP.2017.2708099,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937951,Antenna measurements;antenna theory;near-field far-field transformation,Probes;Antenna measurements;Position measurement;Coordinate measuring machines;Antenna radiation patterns;Rotation measurement,,26,,10,IEEE,1 Jun 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
