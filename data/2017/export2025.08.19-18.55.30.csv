To prevent the excitation of surface waves, the principle of an integrated lens antenna (ILA) is used. In-antenna power-combining is realized by using a novel concept in which the outputs of two or more parallel differential amplifiers are directly combined in the radiating element itself. The proof-of-concept is shown by characterizing the antennas directly without the amplifiers being connected and by using adequate feeding networks capable of demonstrating high ILA bandwidths. Further, the power-splitting is realized through distributed transformer circuits, which offer high bandwidths at low losses. Different antennas are evaluated in order to attain reflection coefficients better than -10 dB over the entire frequency band of 200-320 GHz. Finally, the power-combining capabilities of such antennas are demonstrated by connecting a four-feed differential antenna to four single stage cascode amplifiers in parallel.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2634398","DFG within the framework program SPP 1655(grant numbers:ZW 180/11-1 (Real100G.RF)); Helmholtz International Research School for Teratronics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7762824","Dielectric lens;H-band;in-antenna power-combining;integrated lens antenna (ILA);millimeter-wave (mm-wave) single-chip integrated circuits;multiple-feed antenna;system-on-chip","Antenna feeds;Impedance;Lenses;Bandwidth;Antenna measurements","","43","","20","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In designing the wireless devices to be placed in direct contact with the human skin, the presence of the lossy body cannot be ignored because of strong electromagnetic interactions. In this paper, the performance of epidermal antennas, for application to radio frequency identification (RFID) links in the UHF band, was investigated by means of numerical simulations and laboratory tests on fabricated prototypes. The analysis demonstrates the existence of an optimal size of the antennas (from 3 to 6 cm for loops and from 6 to 15 cm for dipoles) and of upper bounds in the achievable radiation gain (less than -10 dB in the case of 0.5 mm thick application substrates) as a consequence of the balance between the two opposing mechanisms of radiation and loss. This behavior, which is controlled by the hosting medium, does not depend on the antenna shape, even if the loop layout permits considerably minimizing the device size. Even the conductivity of the antenna trace plays only a second-order role; low-cost inkjet printable paints with conductivity higher than 104 S/m are suitable to provide radiation performance comparable with the performance of copper-made antennas. Starting from the investigation of the above cited physical phenomena, including the effect of common classes of suitable substrate membranes, guidelines are finally derived for the optimal design of real RFID epidermal antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2639829","University of Roma Tor Vergata under the Consolidate the Foundation program: RADIOSKIN; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782835","Body sensor network;epidermal antennas;radio frequency identification (RFID);skin sensor;UHF RFID tags;wireless sensor","Dipole antennas;Epidermis;UHF antennas;Shape;Layout","","44","","26","IEEE","14 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is of particular interest for low-frequency antennas for which anechoic chambers cannot be developed and far-held measurements are rather cumbersome. Nonintrusive, broadband measurements are performed using an extremely small all-dielectric electro-optical probe to measure the tangential electric fields of an antenna under test (AUT) at a very-near surface enclosing the antenna. Far-held radiation is computed from a new near-held to far-held transformation formulation using only the tangential components of the electric held over an arbitrary surface. This procedure employs reciprocity theorem and the excited electric current on the surface of a perfect electric conductor enclosure having the same geometry as the scanned surface and illuminated by a plane wave. In this way, a full spherical radiation pattern and gain of the AUT are easily computed without expensive computation and truncation errors. To demonstrate the proposed approach, a miniaturized low very high frequency antenna operating at 40 MHz with dimensions 0.013λ0 × 0.013λ0 × 0.02λ0 is utilized. The far-held results from our approach are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained from full-wave simulation and direct far-held measurement performed in an elevated outdoor range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2633949","U.S. Army Research Laboratory through collaborative participation in the Microelectronics Center of Micro Autonomous Systems and Technology Collaborative Technology Alliance(grant numbers:W911NF); National Science Foundation through ECE Program(grant numbers:1101868); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7762849","Antenna measurements;antenna radiation patterns;electrically small antennas;electro-optical (EO) system;high frequency (HF)/very HF (VHF) antennas;near-field measurements","Antenna measurements;Probes;Surface waves;Antenna radiation patterns;Magnetic field measurement;Electric fields","","20","","31","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the modular antenna configuration, a field coverage is guaranteed up to a few decimeters away from the reader surface (radiative NF region).

The solution is valid for comparatively large disks (at least few wavelengths in diameter). At the same time, the separation of the disks can be arbitrary. The proposed analysis is similar to the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction and provides asymptotic formulas describing the radiated field in both the far- and near-field zones. However, the method is novel since it is based on the canonical problem of diffraction on an open end of a parallel-plate waveguide and therefore takes into account the presence of higher order guided modes travelling between the disks. The method allows calculation of the total radiated power, which has maxima at frequencies equal to real parts of resonator's complex eigenfrequencies.

First of all, four shorting pins are introduced along the diagonals of the dual-fed square patch, so as to exhibit that the 3-dB ARBW can be significantly extended if the shorting position and pin radius are properly chosen. Next, the two degenerate modes in a single-fed CP patch antenna are slightly separated in resonant frequencies by loading another pair of shorting pins along the central line of the patch, so as to excite CP radiation. After extensive analysis is executed, two patch antennas with and without shorting pins are fabricated and measured.

By alternatively and periodically loading the microstrip line with blocking stubs, the equivalent magnetic currents along one direction are suppressed while the currents along the other direction are left, forming a relatively uniform and in-phase 1-D magnetic current array. The electromagnetic wave is radiated into space while traveling forward along the line.

The proposed method is based on the generalized Intersection Approach framework using the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm as backward projector, and the employed full-wave analysis is based on the Method of Moments assuming Local Periodicity (MoM-LP). Several strategies to accelerate the computations are exploited, such as the parallelization of all the algorithm building blocks. To minimize the impact of MoM-LP in the optimization process, a strategy to reduce the number of MoM-LP calls is described, further accelerating the algorithm. Moreover, the convergence is improved by working with the squared field amplitude, alleviating the trap problem of local optimizers. This method allows to optimize the crosspolar component in the whole visible region or only in the coverage zone to facilitate the convergence, reducing computing time and memory usage.

This paper aims to create a more thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of ALMA through realistic modeling of the primary beams and simulated observations, which in turn can inform the user of the necessity of implementing more computationally costly algorithms, such as A-Projection, and when simpler, quicker algorithms will suffice. We quantify our results by examining the dynamic range of each observation, along with the ability to reconstruct the Stokes I amplitude of the test sources. These tests conclude that for the dynamic ranges of less than 1000, for point sources and sources much smaller than the main lobe of the primary beam, the accuracy of the primary beam model beyond the physical size of the aperture simply does not matter.

Theoretical formulations of the radiation fields are deduced, and factors affecting the mode distribution are identified. Because the array antenna cannot ideally generate a pure mode, two indicators, namely, the fundamental mode energy ratio and the degree of intensity deviation, are defined to evaluate the quality of the radiated vortex beams. The relationship between mode purity and the array parameters, OAM mode number and elevation angle, is shown through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Given a threshold of mode purity, the boundary of the pure mode region is determined, and the minimum number of elements is obtained to ensure that the main lobe is located in the pure region. An X-band experimental setup for vortical radio beams is created, and the radiation field is measured to validate the theoretical results.

Suitable expressions for the energy stored in the region and the energy absorbed from the boundaries are introduced, and used to show that the FDTD system is dissipative under a generalized Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. Based on the concept of dissipation, a powerful theoretical framework to investigate the stability of FDTD-like methods is devised. The new method makes FDTD stability proofs simpler, more intuitive, and modular. Stability conditions can indeed be given on the individual components (e.g., boundary conditions, meshes, and embedded models) instead of the whole coupled setup. As an example of application, we derive a new subgridding scheme with support for material traverse, arbitrary grid refinement, and guaranteed stability.

The amplitudes of forward waves are determined by matching with the incident plane wave. To find the amplitudes of backward waves, the surface of strongly elongated spheroid near its rear tip is approximated by a paraboloid, and the solution proposed by Fock is used. At large distances from the tip, this solution transforms to the sum of incoming and outgoing waves, which are matched to the forward and backward waves, respectively. This defines the amplitudes of backward waves. Finally, the field of backward waves, initially given in the form of a series with respect to the solutions of a complicated dispersion equation, is represented in the form of an integral similar to that for the forward waves.

The main beam of the antenna scans from backfire to endfire as operating frequency increases owing to its periodic structure. Truncating the periodic offset DSPSL improved the current distribution and consequently broadened the impendence, enhancing the radiation patterns. Experimental results showed that the main lobe scans electronically and continuously from the backfire (-z-direction) to endfire in the yz plane toward the absolute end-firing direction (+z-direction) with two open stopbands when operating frequency increases from 1.2 to 5.9 GHz. The peak gain of the antenna is about 9.7 dBi, and the gain in the whole working band exceeds 4 dBi.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2632520","Nature Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2015A030312010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755815","Backfire to endfire;double-side parallel-strip lines (DSPSL);open stopband;periodic;triangle truncated","Periodic structures;Antenna radiation patterns;Harmonic analysis;Structural beams;Surface impedance;Microstrip","","44","","20","IEEE","23 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Directivity-enhancing screens that attract Poynting streamlines and increase the aperture efficiency of a horn antenna to almost 200% are studied.

The measured gains are 36.7 dBic with aperture efficiency of 64.1% at 20.4 GHz and 40.2 dBic with aperture efficiency of 65.4% at 30.2 GHz, respectively. The measured aperture efficiencies exceed 47% within the whole receiving band (19.6-21.2 GHz) and 59% within the whole transmitting band (29.4-31 GHz), respectively. The proposed dual-band circularly polarized reflectarray antenna can be used for satellite communication applications at Ka-band.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2633159","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7762084","Dual-band;frequency selective surface (FSS);mutual coupling suppression;reflectarray","Frequency selective surfaces;Mutual coupling;Reflector antennas;Reflection;Dual band;Apertures;Bandwidth","","82","","11","IEEE","29 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The TDEFIEs are usually solved by combining the method of moments (MoM) in space domain and march-on-in-time (MoT) scheme in time domain. In the space-domain MoM, the electric current density is represented with the Rao-WiltonGlisson (RWG) basis function, while the magnetic current density is expanded by the n̂×RWG basis function, which may not be good, since it is not divergenceor curl-conforming. Also, the MoT scheme has a well-known late-time instability problem, which will aggravate in timedomain surface integral equations with penetrable media. We present a different strategy to solve the TDEFIEs by using the Nyström method to discretize the space domain and using the Galerkin method with Laguerre basis and testing functions to discretize the time domain.

While the quantitative results of that paper are correct, there is an issue with its treatment of noise received by array antennas due to noise radiation from the background (external noise). Equation (1) of that paper gives noise received by the  $k$ th array element, and the text describes the noise temperature ( $T_{i}$ ) in that equation as the “antenna (sky) temperature.” This should clearly be the temperature corresponding to the background noise received by the individual array elements, which includes all contributions from within the gain pattern of the individual element, which is typically much broader than the pattern of the array. However, later in the paper, this same symbol is used as the temperature corresponding to the background noise received by the array (into the receiver in Lee’s Fig. 1, after losses). These two temperatures can be very different. For example, small, individual elements of a large array could receive substantial contributions from the ground and other hot objects (e.g., at  $T \sim 300$  K), while the array’s receiver only receives significant contributions from a very quiet region of the sky (e.g., at  $T \sim 4$  K at some frequencies).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2623650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727961","Antenna arrays;arrays;noise;phased arrays","Antenna arrays;Noise measurement;Signal processing","","1","","2","IEEE","1 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Indeed, such coherent noise must be taken into account in the calculation of antenna system temperature. However, this is considered to be a special case, far from the general situation studied by Lee [2011] whose noise model was based on the experience that most radar antennas operate in an environment where external noises from various sources are random in nature by the central limit theorem. Smith appears to have some misunderstanding of the original paper. The author disagrees with his comment that external noise primarily comes in from the main beam.
