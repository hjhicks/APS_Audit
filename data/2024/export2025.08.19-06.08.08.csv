This new electric and magnetic coupling cancellation (EMCC) decoupling concept is simple yet highly effective, requiring no additional decoupling structures or complicated manufacturing processes. According to the proposed concept, the mutual coupling between two patches can be suppressed by controlling the weight of the electric (E) and magnetic (H) coupling between them. When the E-coupling and H-coupling are comparable, a deep null will arise on the mutual coupling curve, resulting in high isolation in the band of interest. To validate the approach, two prototypes for both two-element and four-element multi-input multi-output (MIMO) arrays are designed, fabricated, and measured. The experimental results agree well with the simulations, highlighting the advantages of this method, including low cost, high isolation, and simple antenna structures.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3376075","Huawei Technology Ltd; Royal Society-International Exchanges 2019 Cost Share (NSFC)(grant numbers:IEC\NSFC\191780); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10474287","Cancellation;closely placed;decoupling;multi-input multi-output (MIMO);patch antenna","Antenna measurements;Antennas;Mutual coupling;Antenna arrays;Patch antennas;MIMO communication;Couplings","","10","","35","CCBYNCND","19 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, to achieve multiband aperture sharing, we propose a topology optimization method for the radiation structure of antennas for UWB ad hoc networks based on an improved genetic algorithm (GA) and trust region framework. In addition, we fabricate the optimized multiband antenna, measure its performance in an RF shield box, and take an experiment based on a four-node UWB ad hoc network. Through the quantitative analysis of simulation and experimental results, we found that the fabricated antenna achieves high isolation, a large front-to-back ratio (FBR), and an impedance bandwidth of 81.2% with a small size. In addition, the antenna can also absorptive bandpass filter (ABPF) and separate signals of different frequency bands on cross-polarization components.

Benefiting from the characteristic mode analysis (CMA), it can be found that the metasurface structure can provide an inherent upper radiation null to design filtering antennas. Further, by loading stubs and etching slots on the metasurface, several radiation nulls can be generated, which can realize one high-suppression filtering antenna with an out-of-band suppression level of about 30 dB. Next, by rotating the metasurface structure and stubs at 45°, the positions between the metasurface and feeding slot are changed; thus, lesser CMA modes radiating at broadside direction are excited in the upper stopband, resulting in a wide stopband feature, and the stop suppression range is about  $2.15f_{0}$  (where  $f_{0}$  is the center frequency).

We investigate the operation of the proposed lens and we demonstrate that it provides similar focusing properties as the Luneburg lens, but with a flexible refractive index profile. This flexibility can be used to alleviate the strict manufacturing constraints typically associated with the Luneburg lens. We validate the properties of the proposed lens with a demonstrator at millimeter-wave frequencies showing that an antenna based on the proposed lens can obtain similar directivity and sidelobe levels to those obtained in an ideal Luneburg lens antenna, while the proposed lens is easier to realize.

This fundamental problem in AIA design emerges from the lack of an impedance-matching flexibility between the antenna aperture and active element for high dc-to-RF efficiency without deteriorating the radiator’s performance. This work proposes and presents an approach for the seamless integration of AIAs based on a modified rectangular patch loaded with shorting pins. Numerical and experimental results obtained in this research demonstrate that by distributing the shorting pins in the nodes of the fundamental and second-harmonic spatial modes of the canonical patch, new degrees of freedom for flexible impedance matching can be achieved without compromising the radiator’s radiation pattern, polarization purity, and radiation efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed design strategy is illustrated by a fabricated seamlessly integrated AIA that presents the highest active gain reported in the literature while keeping cross-polarization (CP) and harmonic-interference levels low. Based on the obtained results, the proposed design strategy is believed to have great potential for developing low-cost and high-efficiency far-field simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT) base stations for batteryless Internet of Things (IoT) applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3375654","AP-S Graduate Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10473690","Active antennas;antenna input impedance;power amplifiers (PAs)","Impedance;Topology;Antennas;Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer;Manganese;Harmonic analysis;Impedance matching","","4","","37","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, the quantum gene can express more antenna schemes than the ordinary gene with the same gene size, which can significantly improve the algorithm’s searchability with a small population size.

The corrugated structure introduces additional reactive loading, which slows the wave propagation. This makes the antenna appear electrically longer and consequently reduces the resonance frequency. The technique is applied to a basic microstrip antenna operating at 8 GHz. The use of corrugation heights of 3.2 and 4.0 mm on a 4.8 mm thick substrate results in a reduction of the resonance frequency by 2.2 and 3.5 GHz, resulting in antenna miniaturization of 27.5% and 43.8%, respectively. Importantly, this technique does not lead to significant reduction in the antenna operation bandwidth. The proposed method is straightforward to apply and can be realized with a standard fabrication process. It can be in principle applied to any existing microstrip antenna with a full ground plane. Moreover, the proposed method preserves the original shape of the radiator, avoiding significant changes in radiation performance and reducing the cross-polarization level—qualities desirable for wireless communications. The miniaturized textile antenna with corrugation height of 3.2 mm demonstrated here operates at the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band of 5.8 GHz and is suitable for wireless body area network (WBAN) applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3385909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499215","Antenna miniaturization;corrugated structure;flexible antennas;full ground plane;microstrip antenna;textile antennas;wearable antennas;wireless body area network (WBAN)","Microstrip antennas;Antennas;Resonant frequency;Microstrip;Substrates;Periodic structures;Loading","","4","","57","IEEE","16 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the fixed-beam bandwidth can be expanded by loading a set of different resonant elements. A design of fixed-beam microstrip LWA using the multiresonance technique is demonstrated and investigated. The antenna consists of a main microstrip line that is periodically loaded with a set of  $L$ -shaped coupling patches of different sizes on both sides. The patches have different resonant frequencies, which act as radiators to generate leaky wave radiation and as resonant elements to compensate for dispersion in a wide operating band. A prototype of the antenna designed for radiating at -14° is fabricated and measured.

The proposed array realizes improved directivity and low sidelobes at large scanning angles, at the cost of a small reduction of directivity in the broadside. The method of symmetrical phase exchange achieves wideband capability, even though the unequal phase delay is frequency-dependent.

Several techniques have evolved to mitigate the problem, which include amplitude tapering, genetic algorithm (GA) optimization, thinning transceiver aperture, and two-weight amplitude distribution. With such optimization schemes, the SLs can be considerably suppressed but at the cost of a reduction in directivity or taper efficiency. Furthermore, such amplitude tapers require a complex feeding network design. This work alleviates such design restrictions and proposes a systematic approach to lower the SLs in radar two-way shared aperture arrays. The proposed methodology can achieve an SL level (SLL) of below −52 dB in both linear and planar arrays, which is about 18 dB enhancement in SLL compared with uniform transmit and thinned receive arrays. In addition, as a result of the equal transceiver array size in the proposed design, an improvement of approximately 0.44 dB and 0.68 dB in directivity is achieved in linear and planar arrays, respectively.

Measurement results show that the developed array achieves a wider impedance bandwidth, commendable cross-polarization discrimination (XPD), and a significantly more compact design than previously reported systems. In its omnidirectional mode, the array exhibits a 107.07% bandwidth (VSWR  $\le 2.0$ ) with an XPD level better than 19.5 dB. In its directional mode, the array operates over 100% bandwidth with an XPD level better than 20.9 dB. The prototype exhibits exceptional azimuthal out-of-roundness values better than 1.3 dB in its omnidirectional mode and scan-invariant radiation with a maximum deviation of only 0.8 dB in its directional mode.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3373173","University of Technology Sydney; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10477899","Circular phased array;directional radiation;long-slot array;omnidirectional radiation;ultra-wideband (UWB);vertical polarization (VP)","Antenna arrays;Phased arrays;Bandwidth;Metals;Baluns;Substrates;Arrays","","2","","36","IEEE","25 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the wave conversion process of the structure with incident angle, scan angle, and polarization is theoretically investigated by the proposed equivalent circuit model (ECM), which reveals that the polarization conversion ratio (PCR) is determined by the impedance transforming via the patch. Then, two methods are proposed to achieve a relatively constant relationship of PCR with the incident angle or scan angle, including broadening the beamwidth of the active element patterns and adjusting the feeding positions according to our proposed theory. To reach these goals, four open-ended stubs are loaded on the patch, so as to broaden the 3-dB beamwidth of the patch by reducing the electrical length between two equivalent slots. Taking advantage of the transmission line theory, the desired PCR with different incident angles and scan angles can be easily achieved by only tuning the equivalent feeding positions of the patch. Finally, based on the phased array theory, three PRPMS prototypes are calculated, designed, fabricated, and measured to verify our design concept. Good agreements between these results show that the PRPMS can successfully alter the incident wave to the wanted angle and rotate the polarization while maintaining the PCR over 80%. The results verify that it is possible to use this method in the design of functional surfaces.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3376082","National Natural Science Foundation of China through General Program(grant numbers:61971475); Science and Technology Development Fund (FDCT) of Macao through FDCT Research(grant numbers:0080/2021/A2,0085/2020/AMJ); University of Macau through Research(grant numbers:CPG2023-00020-FST,MYRG-GRG2023-00031-FST-UMDF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10474303","Enhanced beam-steering;feeding position adjustment;minimized patch;pattern manipulation surface (PMS)","Surface waves;Microstrip;Surface impedance;Scattering;Optical surface waves;Pins;Impedance","","2","","36","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the method defines the objective function as minimizing the discrepancy between the resulting array pattern and an adaptive reference pattern. This innovative choice obviates the need for introducing numerous sidelobe constraints, streamlining the optimization problem significantly. Second, the method incorporates a redundancy elimination technique. This technique involves calculating the theoretical limits for the achievable minimum spacing and aperture, allowing for the selective retention of only the nonredundant positional constraints. This step further reduces the optimization’s computational complexity. Several numerical examples are conducted for different applications.

In this article, the use of artificial dielectric sheets is proposed for reducing the spread of the active reflection coefficient with scan angle. The design method is illustrated based on the impedance matching performed in front of the array face using the admittance seen looking into the array from space. A novel metasurface is developed based on subwavelength-sized conductive particles patterned on both sides of a thin dielectric sheet. Loading a thin dielectric sheet with these particles enables the effective susceptance of the sheet to be tuned. The variation of the array reflection coefficient with scan angle is reduced by providing the required susceptance at a certain distance in front of the array face using the sheet. Two different particle shapes are used to load the dielectric sheet, namely strips and split rings. It is shown that the proposed artificial dielectric sheet is capable of improving the active reflection coefficient when the mutual coupling is the primary factor in limiting the scan range. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed design is suitable for phased arrays with a wide frequency bandwidth. Finally, simulation and measurement results for a uniform  $9\,\, {}\times {}9$  element patch antenna array, compensated using this method, are presented.

The SES is based on a passive panel of reflective elements that not only redirects the impinging wave provided by the base station (BS) but also shapes the reflected field into a desired direction. The SES aims to overcome a blind zone in a coverage generated by the different propagation issues at those frequencies. The design of the SES is based on the well-known technique of the Intersection Approach for near-field shaping. This fact is particularly important since the coverage in this type of scenario would have the users within the Fresnel Region of the SES and not in far-field conditions. The design goal is to generate a prescribed shaped beam in a near-field area, operating in two orthogonal linear polarizations. Then, the results obtained with the synthesis techniques are used to design a reflective SES based on sets of coplanar dipoles, which provides independent control of both linear polarizations using a single-dielectric layer. As an example of interest, a pencil beam is converted into a square reflected beam of 20 $^{\circ }\,\,\times20^{\circ }$ . The designed SES is manufactured and measured in a planar acquisition range in order to evaluate the performance of the coverage. The measurements show a good agreement with the simulations, showing the importance of designing this type of antenna considering the radiation within the near field.

Many of the current in situ techniques estimate the mutual coupling matrix (MCM), which is not an appropriate model for many arrays and does not account for platform scattering. To overcome these limitations, we develop an in situ calibration technique that represents the array response as a spherical mode expansion (SME). Our proposed technique utilizes an alternating minimization algorithm to iteratively solve for both the unknown signals received by the array and the coefficients of the SME. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique using a simulation of a moving antenna array affected by platform scattering that receives signals from multiple stationary transmitters.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3381831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10492664","Array signal processing;calibration;direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;electromagnetic scattering","Antenna arrays;Calibration;Array signal processing;Antenna measurements;Q measurement;Vectors;Adaptive arrays","","1","","47","IEEE","4 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mechanism for the hybrid phase is analyzed using the linear polarization scattering matrix. The achieved reflectarray can provide independent left-hand circularly polarized (LCP) and right-hand circularly polarized (RCP) beams in the ±20° range.

A structure that implements the VP effect is proposed, realizing polarization control of chiral EWs. The incident polarized waves under consideration have their electric field aligned parallel to the  ${x}$ – $y$  plane. These EWs can be separated into two polarized waves: transverse electric (TE) waves and transverse magnetic (TM) ones, with components directed along the  $x$ -axis and  $y$ -axis, respectively.

In this article, we propose a near-field imaging scheme based on holographic aperture RIS for both 2-D and 3-D targets. Specifically, we first establish an end-to-end EM propagation model from the perspective of Maxwell equations. To mitigate the inherent ill-conditioning of the inverse problem in the imaging system, we design the EM field patterns as masks that help translate the inverse problem into a forward problem. Next, we utilize RIS to generate different virtual EM masks on the target and calculate the cross correlation between the mask patterns and the electric field strength at the receiver. We then provide a RIS design scheme for virtual EM masks by employing a regularization technique. The cross-range resolution of the proposed method is analyzed based on the spatial spectrum of the generated masks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can produce satisfactory imaging results for both 2-D and 3-D targets. Moreover, the imaging quality can be improved by generating more virtual EM masks, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver, or placing the target closer to the RIS.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3382869","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:623B1013,62325107,62341107,62288101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10491104","Computational imaging;physical equivalent;reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS);virtual masks","Imaging;Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces;Receivers;Transmitters;Radar imaging;Signal to noise ratio;Inverse problems","","14","","53","IEEE","3 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study aims to achieve a high data rate of 20 Mb/s for an implant communication system equipped with narrow-band (NB) small antennas, within the 10–60 MHz human body communication (HBC) band. A signal preemphasis technique is proposed to mitigate channel distortion and overcome bandwidth limitations by precompensating the channel response while shaping the waveform of the transmitted (Tx) signal. By the proposed preemphasis technique, numerical simulation with an anatomical human body model shows that the receiving bandwidth is increased from 9.0 to 46.5 MHz, while reliable communication distance is achieved to 8 cm within the body model. Moreover, experimental measurement with a tissue-equivalent liquid phantom shows that the same antenna as in the simulation realizes a communication distance of 6 cm, while a better-designed wideband antenna enhances the distance to 10 cm.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3380748","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), Japan(grant numbers:23K18562); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701096); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10485255","Bandwidth enhancement;human body communication (HBC) technique;implant communication;signal preemphasis technique;small antenna","Bandwidth;Implants;Wireless communication;Antennas;Finite impulse response filters;Distortion;Body area networks","","2","","42","IEEE","1 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, the complete nonuniform AE of Sommerfeld integral (SI) for the half-space has been formulated. Consequently, based on the identical expansion procedure, this study formulates the complete nonuniform expansion of the DGF into a closed-form expression. Subsequently, its accuracy is investigated compared with that of the numerical integration and the first-order uniform expansion of the function.

Usually, the designs of FSSs are limited to several structure parameters with the assumption of free space or homogeneous background. However, FSSs usually work under inhomogeneous background with various perturbations or devices. In this work, we propose an inverse design method for FSSs with high degrees of freedom, including an artificial neural network (ANN)-based design method and an adjoint gradient-based design method for unit cell and array of FSS, respectively. Specifically, in the ANN-based design method, an initial unit cell is generated by the inverse network, which utilizes both frequency and time information of the demand performance. A key feature of the proposed design method for FSS array is that we use the Green’s function under inhomogeneous background in the forward method, where the computational cost is largely reduced by reciprocal theory. To verify the proposed method, with 400 independent variables to be determined at once, a multifunctional FSS with absorption, diffusion, and transmission abilities under inhomogeneous background is designed, fabricated, and experimentally verified, whose unit cell is both phase- and amplitude-adjustable.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3366650","Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LZ23F010005); Zhejiang Provincial Research and Development Project of China(grant numbers:2021C01043); Key Basic Research of Basic Strengthening Program of the Science and Technology Commission(grant numbers:2020-JCJQ-ZD-068,2019-JCJQ-ZD-128); Defense Industrial Technology Development Program(grant numbers:JCKY 2019207A029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10444659","Artificial neural network (ANN)-based inverse design;frequency selective surface (FSS);Green’s function;inhomogeneous background","Nonhomogeneous media;Design methodology;Electromagnetics;Green's function methods;Scattering parameters;Artificial neural networks;Time-frequency analysis","","3","","45","IEEE","23 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By addressing the problem with different methods offering different levels of complexity, we propose a simple empirical expression linking the refractive index at the lens center and the lens edge.

It acts as a scatter to tailor radio propagation. In this article, the compound scattering of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm via the artificial plasma cloud is studied and its application in over-the-horizon detection is explored for the first time. First, the hybrid technique of the uniform geometric theory of diffraction (UGTD) and high frequency structure simulator (HFSS) software is introduced for different parameters, such as the large scene of clouds, sizes of UAVs, and wavelengths at very high frequency (VHF) band. For radio frequency in the range of 30–70 MHz, it is found that the received power shows a decreasing trend with increasing radio frequencies. Compared with a single UAV, the received power for a UAV swarm is  $\sim$ 20 dB higher, though the fluctuation in radar cross sections (RCSs) is due to the superposition of swarm factor. Therefore, the optimum radio frequency for the over-the-horizon detection could probably be raised from the commonly used HF band to a new VHF band. It is attractive that the UAV swarm could be detected over-the-horizon via an artificial plasma cloud at the VHF band for meter-level RCS targets. It could also compensate for adverse effects of HF band due to ionospheric disturbances, especially in the maritime environment or emergency scenarios.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3380356","Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ts20190968); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61871352); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10482865","Artificial plasma cloud;electromagnetic (EM) scattering;over-the-horizon;radar cross section (RCS);radio propagation;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Autonomous aerial vehicles;Clouds;Plasmas;Scattering;Vectors;Radio propagation;Surface waves","","","","24","IEEE","27 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most existing works rely on passive diffractive components, and the enormous network parameters and sufficient computing resources pose a great roadblock. Another dilemma lies in the experimental realization, in which the design of tunable transmissive metasurfaces is arduous. Here, we propose binary cascaded diffractive layers by applying tunable transmissive metasurfaces with opposite phases and a transmission efficiency of 96%. Our discrete optimization algorithm reduces computational redundancy during the training process and becomes more suitable for deployment in mobile applications, thus preserving network inference accuracy while avoiding heavy computational tasks and memory consumption. By optimizing the transmission state of each neuron, our system can achieve multiple functions on demand, such as a multichannel transmission system and holographic image generation. To validate the feasibility, we fabricated two-layer binary cascaded diffractive layers and tested it using a multichannel transmitter.

The current studies mainly target fixed objects, but few focus on moving targets such as drones. Technical challenges in MWPT for moving targets lie in meeting the real-time and accuracy requirements of beam pointing control while also meeting the quality requirements of the radiation pattern when moving targets are in different positions. To address these performance requirements, this article proposes a fast beam pointing control method based on the deep learning model. Specifically, the ResNet-18 framework is improved as the core to construct the mapping relationship between the positions of moving target within the effective power transmission region and the feeding amplitudes and phases of the phased array antenna. To improve the accuracy of the antenna pattern synthesis, the eigen-driven analysis method (EDM) is proposed, in which the coupling effects among the array elements are considered. To generate numerous and accurate training samples for the deep learning model, an autoencoder combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) with EDM is established, in which a setting mask function is set to quickly and accurately determine the main-lobe and sidelobe intervals at different pointing angles.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3371645","Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJZD-K202000103); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U22B2095); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10461993","Antenna pattern synthesis;beam pointing control;deep learning;eigen-driven analysis method (EDM);microwave wireless power transmission (MWPT);moving target","Phased arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays;Manganese;Antenna feeds;Transmitting antennas;Deep learning","","2","","28","IEEE","6 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the micro-Doppler (m-D) interference generated by the target exhibiting micro-motion components can lead to a locally defocused ISAR image. Moreover, the echoes received by the receiver of the radar may be missing due to the environment for the propagation of electromagnetic waves and the switching of the frequency band of the radar, where this leads to a sparse aperture. A sparse aperture can result in severe interference from sidelobe or grating lobe in the ISAR image. To solve these problems, this article proposes a structured prior model based on the joint constraints of the nuclear norm,  $l_{1}$  norm, and  $l_{2,1}$  norm. The nuclear norm and the  $l_{1}$  norm are used to constrain the low rank and sparsity of the high-resolution range profile (Hrrp) sequence of the target, while the  $l_{2,1}$  norm is used to constrain the structured features of the ISAR image of the main body. Furthermore, we use the linear alternating direction method of multipliers (LADMMs) to solve the model and obtain the final ISAR image of the main body. The proposed method based on the above constraints can not only eliminate interference from the sidelobe and grating lobe as well as m-D interference but also retain the structured features and connectivity of the ISAR image of the main body.

By arranging three pairs of bilayer-dipole-pairs (BDPs) in parallel, the element achieves electric and magnetic resonance modes at the same frequency. In addition, the mutual coupling between the electric and magnetic resonance modes is effectively eliminated by implementing a reverse translation of the BDPs located at the edge of the element. The approach facilitates the realization of dual polarization Huygens’ resonance by combining two orthogonal BDPs. The proposed method eliminates the requirement for substrate thickness as the degree of freedom, enabling the element to achieve Huygens’ resonance even with an ultrathin substrate thickness as low as  $0.05\lambda _{0}$  (where  $\lambda _{0}$  is the free space wavelength). Furthermore, a cylindrical conformal LA operating in the Ka-band is designed based on this proposed HE. Due to the presence of broadband magnetoelectric degeneracy in the HE, the proposed LA prototype exhibits a wider gain BW compared to other conformal LAs with similar thicknesses. Moreover, the LA prototype achieves an aperture efficiency (AE) exceeding 30% due to the high transmittance provided by the proposed HE.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3377930","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271112); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10477680","Conformal;dual polarization;lens antenna (LA);ultrathin Huygens’ element (HE)","Magnetic resonance;Substrates;Lenses;Broadband antennas;Impedance;Couplings;Broadband communication","","6","","18","IEEE","21 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This LWA can not only achieve continuous backward-to-forward scanning without open-stopband (OSB) effect but also has the characteristics of both wide bandwidth (BW) and high polarization purity. The radiation of the LWA is excited by mode discontinuities introduced between the transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves supported by SICLs and quasi-TEM waves supported by MSLs, and continuous backward-to-forward beam scanning can be achieved by optimizing the spacing between the two discontinuities formed by the two modes in each period to suppress the in-phase superposition effect of reflected waves. Meanwhile, in this design, SICLs and MSLs have the same characteristic impedance and surface impedance, as well as the low dispersion, so that a wide operating BW can be achieved due to wideband impedance matching. In addition, due to the fully symmetric electric-field distributions of TEM and quasi-TEM modes, a high level of cross-polarization suppression can be achieved. Experimental results show that the proposed LWA can achieve continuous backward-to-forward scanning with 66% large relative impedance BW (6.4–12.7 GHz) and 65% large pattern BW (6.5–12.7 GHz), as well as a high cross-polarization ratio (XPR), which is measured to be about 27 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3376155","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700201); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071117,61831006,62288101); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:111-2-05); Project for Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professor; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20230192); Fundamental Research Funds of the Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Articially-Structured Functional Materials and Devices(grant numbers:AFMD-KFJJ-22202); Science and Technology Research Funds of Wuxi Taihu-Light Program(grant numbers:K20231007); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242023K5002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10474225","Continuous backward-to-forward scanning;high cross-polarization ratio (XPR);leaky wave antenna (LWA);mode modulation;wide bandwidth (BW)","Impedance;Harmonic analysis;Periodic structures;Surface impedance;Phase modulation;Surface waves;Propagation constant","","3","","34","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To be specific, the Calderón preconditioning technique and a narrow temporal excitation are adopted to avoid the ill-conditioning in space and time dimensions. Meanwhile, the Filon-type method is integrated, resulting in a Calderón-stability-improved marching-on-in-degree (SIMOD) approach during the matrix construction. This method effectively addresses the oscillatory property of the generalized Laguerre polynomials. To obtain accurate results at low frequencies, we introduce two strategies based on Calderón-SIMOD to eliminate the adverse effects of static error current (SEC): the static error current subtraction (SECS) method and its approximate version (ASECS).

To improve the radiation pattern synthesis efficiency for large-scale time-modulated planar arrays (TMPAs), a novel two-stage iterative convex optimization (CVX) method is developed. The proposed method decomposes the complicated large-scale TMPAs optimization problem into two convex subarray optimization problems with much smaller scales. The switch-on time instant for each subarray is optimized in the first stage, while the radiation pattern of the entire array is further optimized in the second stage. Consequently, the time consumption for pattern synthesis is significantly reduced owing to a small number of optimization variables, which makes the proposed method especially attractive for real-time beamforming in large-scale arrays. Numerical example for a 10 000-element TMPA synthesis solution shows that high-precision scanning beams with low sidelobe levels (SLL = −20.0 dB) and low sideband levels (SBL < −30.0 dB) can be efficiently synthesized.

It comprises four identical HMSAs arranged in a crossed-shaped structure. Each beam has a different direction to allow for switchable control according to engineering specifications. The HMSA pattern is generated through holographic interference between the desired beam and the reference wave. A top-hat monopole Yagi radiator is employed as the surface-wave (SW) launcher to produce the reference wave. To enhance the gain, a PCMS is strategically suspended over the HMSA array at a distance of 6 mm. Each cell of the PCMS can provide arbitrary phase compensation in the reference plane to realize the in-phase plane wave. The phase lag arises from nonuniform phase distributions on the MS and different distances from each MS unit cell to the reference plane. It also acts as a superstrate to adjust the free-space wave coupling path. When the free-space wave and SW coupling have the same amplitude but out of phase, they subtract each other. A prototype is fabricated and measured, demonstrating that the use of PCMS can enhance the radiation performance of the HMSA array. This achieves a peak gain of 19.53 dBi, an SLL of less than −14.5 dB, and an aperture efficiency (AE) of more than 26.48%.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3385488","Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing(grant numbers:CSTB2023NSCQ-MSX0001,CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX1125); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10497527","Beam switchable;high gain;holographic metasurface antenna (HMSA);multibeam antenna (MBA);phase-correcting metasurface (PCMS)","Surface impedance;Phase change materials;Impedance;Metasurfaces;Surface waves;Gain;Antennas","","10","","20","IEEE","12 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mechanism of the impact of load impedance changes on the AMSF of the Vivaldi array is systematically analyzed for the first time, and a more accurate method for extracting array element AMSF with the changed load is proposed, which not only considers the influence of mutual coupling but also incorporates the AMSF with the 50- $\Omega $  load. By adjusting the load impendence and optimizing the reflection phase distribution of the array with an optimization algorithm, the manipulated AMSF becomes the cancellation resource to achieve in-band RCS reduction. A  $1\times8$  Vivaldi linear array operating in 8–12 GHz is designed. Two scattering field cancellation cases are presented to verify the proposed method, which is proved to have the advantage of flexibly selecting the focus RCS reduction band. A prototype of the Vivaldi antenna array is fabricated and measured, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the in-band RCS reduction method proposed in this communication.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3381829","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071347,62201417); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10487791","Antenna mode scattering field (AMSF);load impendence;phase distribution optimization;Vivaldi antenna array","Antenna arrays;Scattering;Vivaldi antennas;Phased arrays;Loaded antennas;Reflector antennas;Optimization","","8","","25","IEEE","1 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
