It is established by exploring the fundamental connection between the conventional MLFMA and the recently developed directional fast multipole algorithms (D-FMAs), as well as the plane wave expansion induced from the complex source beam [Gaussian beam (GB)]. Different from the conventional MLFMA which exhibits the complexity of  $O({N^{2}})$  for certain situations such as the quasi-1-D elongated object, the proposed high-frequency generalized version is capable of achieving a stable complexity of  $O({N\log N})$ , irrespective of the dimensional features of the objects. Besides, the proposed algorithm also manifests itself as a spectral counterpart of the traditional D-FMAs. However, unlike the traditional D-FMAs which leverage the equivalent source-based sampling expansions, the proposed algorithm is established using the plane wave-based exponential expansions. Thus, the feasibility of building a D-FMA with analytically diagonalized translators is also demonstrated in this work.

In a similar manner to a layered media Green’s function, self/mutual coupling between source and observation points over the 2-D infinite periodic array of scatterers is formulated as a superposition of direct wave component and TE/TM reflection wave components.

The geometry of the dispersion surface is estimated after mapping the determinant of the periodic MoM impedance matrix over a range of frequencies and impressed phase shifts. For lossless periodic structures in the long-wavelength regime, such as lossless metasurfaces, a tracking algorithm is proposed to represent the dispersion surface as a superposition of parameterized iso-frequency curves. The mapping process of the determinant is accelerated using a specialized interpolation technique with respect to the frequency and impressed phase shifts. The algorithm combines a fast evaluation of the rapidly varying part of the periodic impedance matrix and the interpolation of the computationally intensive but slowly varying remainder. The mapping is further accelerated through the use of macro basis functions (MBFs). The method has been first tested on lossless metasurface-type structures and validated using the commercial software CST. The specialized technique enables a drastic reduction in the number of periodic impedance matrices that need to be explicitly computed. In the two examples considered, only 12 matrices are required to cover any phase shift and a frequency band larger than one octave. An important advantage of the proposed method is that it does not entail any approximation so that it can be used for lossy structure and leaky waves, as demonstrated through two additional examples.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3324083","Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10287773","Dispersion curves;fast-tracking algorithm;interpolation;iso-frequency contours;macro basis functions (MBFs);metasurface;periodic structures","Impedance;Interpolation;Method of moments;Periodic structures;Dispersion;Surface impedance;Transmission line matrix methods","","4","","62","IEEE","18 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The coupling between the HDG and the BI equations is realized using the numerical flux operating on the equivalent current and the global unknown of the HDG. This approach yields sparse coupling matrices upon discretization. Inclusion of the BI equation ensures that the only error in enforcing the radiation conditions is the discretization. However, the discretization of this equation yields a dense matrix, which prohibits the use of a direct matrix solver on the overall coupled system as often done with the traditional HDG schemes. To overcome this bottleneck, a “hybrid” method is developed. This method uses an iterative scheme to solve the overall coupled system but within the matrix–vector multiplication subroutine of the iterations, the inverse of the HDG matrix is efficiently accounted for using a sparse direct matrix solver. The same subroutine also uses the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) to accelerate the multiplication of the guess vector with the dense BI matrix. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy, the efficiency, and the applicability of the proposed HDG-BI solver.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3291746","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271002,62231007); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR)(grant numbers:2019-CRG8-4056); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10179229","Boundary integral (BI) equation;electromagnetic scattering;hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)","Sparse matrices;Method of moments;Mathematical models;Electromagnetic scattering;Finite element analysis;Matrix converters;STEM","","2","","80","CCBY","11 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It applies to curvilinear geometries and/or inhomogeneous materials, preserves the nullspace of the curl operator, and is computationally efficient. In the FE integrals, the terms incorporating the effects of geometry and materials are expanded in a series of multivariate polynomials. As a result, the element matrices can always be integrated analytically by means of predefined universal matrices. The mapping from the reference element to the physical configuration is done by suitable forms of the Piola transformation so that the resulting FE bases are guaranteed to preserve the nullspace of the curl operator. A mathematical proof, including the curvilinear case, is included. The suggested approach features a representation limit: When the metric expansion is continued beyond a critical order, which is determined by the order of the FE basis, the truncation error becomes zero. Hence, the number of universal matrices is bounded, and the sole source of error is the numerical calculation of the expansion coefficients for the metric terms. The method is validated by numerical examples, and its computational efficiency is demonstrated by a comparison to competing approaches.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3293652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10180209","Curvilinear;FE method (FEM);finite element (FE) analysis;hierarchical;inhomogeneous;isoparametric;orthogonal polynomial;universal matrix","Measurement;Finite element analysis;Geometry;Jacobian matrices;Nonhomogeneous media;Material properties;Interpolation","","1","","42","IEEE","12 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time-extrapolation techniques based on reduced-order models (ROMs), such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) can be used not only to reduce the computation time but also to provide additional physical insights for diagnostic purposes. In this work, we present a data-driven ROM based on Hankel-DMD for rapid analysis and extrapolation of time-domain EM responses in resonant cavities. High-fidelity training data are obtained from the partial (short-time) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. We apply the Hankel-DMD algorithm on the FDTD data to extract the underlying key spatial (DMD modes) and temporal (DMD frequencies) features to build an accurate reduced-order predictive model. We then use the ROM to forecast the cavity electric field at any time instant with a very small computation cost. Since FDTD data are used for DMD training, we also devise an on-the-fly sliding-window DMD method to optimize data acquisition and automate the handoff from the FDTD simulation to the DMD algorithm.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3295511","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Cooperative Agreement HR 0011-21-2-0020; Ohio Supercomputer Center(grant numbers:PAS-0061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10188588","Cavity resonance;data-driven;dynamic mode decomposition (DMD);reduced-order model (ROM);time extrapolation","Time-domain analysis;Finite difference methods;Resonant frequency;Electromagnetics;Read only memory;Feature extraction;Time-frequency analysis","","7","","49","IEEE","19 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, complex propagation environments are divided into smaller subdomains, thereby confining the rays to propagate in a smaller and simpler space. The subdomains are surrounded by the Huygens surfaces and equivalent Huygens sources interconnect the ray-based field representations in neighboring subdomains. Compared to conventional shooting and bouncing rays (SBR)-based ray tracing simulations, which detect relevant ray hits at receivers via small reception spheres, this approach distributes the wave representation over many rays and collects their overall influence via Huygens surface integrations. By a smart choice of the Huygens surfaces, the ray coverage in complex environments can be increased considerably. Concerning diffraction computations, which rely conventionally on the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD), the flexibility of choosing Huygens surfaces allows to distribute diffraction edges over different subdomains, thus, eliminating the need for consecutive UTD evaluations and the corresponding problems in finding correct multiple diffraction paths. Together with smart ray launching strategies and quickly converging integration methods, the presented approach allows many successive diffraction evaluations with reasonable accuracy and efficiency. The implementation is based on graphics processing units (GPUs), enabling massively parallelized simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3326942","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(grant numbers:EI 352/24-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10301521","Diffraction;graphics processing unit (GPU);Huygens principle;physical optics (POs);ray tracing","Optical surface waves;Diffraction;Ray tracing;Surface waves;Graphics processing units;Reflection;Receivers","","4","","30","IEEE","30 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this challenge, this article proposed an echo suppression method using phaseless data at a single frequency. With the proposed method, one can discriminate the multipath characteristic convoluted with the actual antenna pattern by measuring the antenna gain pattern at multiple spatial locations. Different from the state-of-the-art methods requiring phase information, the proposed method is an amplitude-only technique, thus enabling cost-effective and true over-the-air (OTA) measurement for the wireless device. Furthermore, we derived a systematic guideline for the proposed method to improve measurement efficiency based on numerical simulations. The proposed method is experimentally validated by placing a metal plate in the chamber to emulate a nonanechoic environment, and a good agreement between the true antenna pattern and the reconstructed antenna gain pattern is found.

The presented method consists in connecting two open waveguiding structures designed to propagate a leaky wave with opposite phase velocities. The feed is positioned at the intersection plane, where the two branches are connected and are chosen to excite the propagative mode guaranteeing continuity of phase at said intersection plane. Thus, a unidirectional leaky wave will travel from one end of the structure to the other with a double exponential amplitude distribution. The provided analysis shows that, compared to conventional (single-sided) LWAs of the same length, and compared to bidirectional LWAs of the same length operating at an off-broadside angle, the beamwidth can be considerably reduced and the SLL can be concurrently reduced to a significant degree. Additionally, the directivity may be increased.

Moreover, the electric/magnetic coupling between the driven patch, dual mode coupled patch, and planar coupled strips enables the creation of three radiation nulls that suppress unwanted radiation.

The antenna can produce two directive beam radiations realized by the proposed specific structure of combing a Fabry–Perot cavity antenna (FPCA) and a folded transmitarray (FTA) configuration for radiation controls at X- and Ka-bands, respectively. To hybridize these two kinds of radiation controls, it has to be achieved by the reuse of an aperture and the exploitation of distinct functions for two individual frequency bands on the same antenna body. Specifically, an aperture layer acts as a partially reflective surface (PRS) at the X-band and a polarization grating (PG) surface at the Ka-band; meanwhile, a ground layer functions as a metal reflector at the X-band and a reflecting polarizer (RP) at the Ka-band. To satisfy the above requirements, two different unit cells (UCs) are studied and analyzed to constitute the aperture layer and the ground layer for providing the controls of two radiation conditions. In addition, the feeding sources are constructed from two patch antennas (for FPCA excitation) and a 3-D printing small horn antenna (for FTA excitation). For validation, a fully functional prototype is fabricated and measured. The measured results show that the antenna realizes an effective bandwidth (for the reflection coefficient  $\le -10$  dB and the gain variation  $\le3$  dB) from 8.62 to 9.35 GHz at the X-band and from 24 to 34 GHz at the Ka-band. The measured peak realized gain is 15.5 and 23.1 dBi at two bands, respectively. The proposed design inherits the advantages of FPCA and FTA, making it promising for future wireless communication systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3336368","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071408); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong, SAR, China(grant numbers:CityU 11215522); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022B1515130011); 2022 Guangzhou Development District International Technology Cooperation Funding Scheme(grant numbers:2022GH07); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341281","Dual-band;Fabry–Perot (FP) cavity;high gain;shared aperture;transmitarray (TA)","Aperture antennas;Dual band;Reflector antennas;Frequency measurement;Directive antennas;Antennas;Transmitting antennas","","14","","24","IEEE","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is achieved by making use of two spatial harmonics for radiation. The unit cell of the periodic microstrip antenna contains three meanders with mitred corners. To ensure circular polarization, a theoretical formulation is developed taking into account the delay caused by the microstrip length intervals. It defines the unit cell geometry by determining the length of the meanders to ensure that the axial ratio remains below 3dB throughout the operational band. Moreover, the meanders are used to provide better control over scanning rate (the ratio of change in angle of maximum radiation with frequency) and reduce spurious radiation of harmonics by ensuring single-harmonic operation within the operational band. To guarantee continuous scanning through broadside direction, open stopband is suppressed using mitered angles. The antenna is designed on a 0.254-mm substrate making it suitable for conformal applications. The fabricated antenna shows a backward-to-forward beam steering range of 72° (−42° to 30°) in the K-band (19.4–27.5 GHz) with circular polarization and of 75° (−15°to 60°) in the Ku-band (11–15.5 GHz) with linear polarization.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3328558","French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) through the Project MedWave(grant numbers:ANR-21-CE19-0045); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:N°899546); European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:N°101063966); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10310016","Higher spatial order;K-band;Ku-band;lwa;meandering microstrip antenna;scanning rate","Harmonic analysis;Microstrip;Microstrip antennas;Polarization;K-band;Directive antennas;Antennas","","12","","48","IEEE","6 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Array calibration is essential to ensure phased array beamforming performance. The amplitude-only calibration methods, which only require amplitude measurement, are highly attractive especially when phase measurement is unavailable or unreliable. One of the most widely applied methods is the rotating element electric field vector (REV) method. However, it becomes more sensitive to noise when the element number of the array under test (AUT) increases, making it unreliable for large-scale phased array calibration. In this work, a novel amplitude-only calibration method is proposed for large-scale phased arrays when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) condition in the measurement is low. The basic idea is to divide the AUT elements into several groups and to perform the group-wise REV operations of the AUT in multiple rounds. Numerical simulations and experimental results have validated the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in calibrating large-scale phased arrays over the classic element-wise REV method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3333387","start-up Research Fund of Southeast University, China; European Partnership on Metrology Project (MEWS) funded by the European Partnership on Metrology, through the European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme and the Participating States(grant numbers:21NRM03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10326459","Amplitude-only measurement;antenna measurement;array calibration;phased array;rotating element electric field vector (REV) method","Calibration;Phased arrays;Antenna measurements;Phase measurement;Probes;Radio frequency;Rotation measurement","","8","","28","IEEE","22 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Introducing a phase-gradient reflective surface (PGRS) in the folded scheme, the space sandwiched by the TA surface and the feed is reduced by two-third, leading to the low-profile structure. To validate this scheme, a center-fed ME dipole antenna is proposed and extended to be a dual-LP TA element with independently controlled 1-bit resolution for the two orthogonal linear polarizations. On the other hand, the PGRS element is composed of cross-dipole and ME dipole structures, which can provide over 360° phase shift range and generate a focus and work as the feeding source. To verify its feasibility, a prototype operating at 26 GHz is simulated, processed, and tested. The measured results show that the proposed folded TA antenna can achieve a peak gain of 23 dBi, a peak aperture efficiency of 21%, and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 26% for  $x$ -polarization. The corresponding results for the  $y$ -polarization are 23 dBi, 21%, and 28%, respectively.

We implement PC dynamics by modulating the relative amplitudes of the signals fed to two antenna elements. By moving the PC symmetrically with respect to the geometric center of the array, the far-field amplitude pattern remains mostly constant while the phase pattern changes, imparting modulation onto the transmitted or received signals that is a function of the angle. The resulting directional modulation (DM) effectively scrambles the information in the radiated waveform at angles outside of the information beam, where the modulation impacts are negligible. The result is a narrow region where information is recoverable, and since the radiated power does not change, the efficiency remains high. We present the design of a 2.5-GHz two-element array with asymmetric amplitude modulation and characterize the PC location as a function of the amplitude ratio between the elements. We demonstrate secure wireless communication experimentally in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment, demonstrating the reduction in throughput due solely to the PC dynamics.

The RF and optical features of liquid crystal (LC) technology are used in combination with transparent metal mesh to realize the first optically transparent reconfigurable reflectarray (RA). Since the electric field of bias and radio frequency (RF) signals is highly nonuniform, the LC permittivity is both anisotropic and inhomogeneous, and thus, the behavior of LC molecules needs to be obtained for accurate modeling prior to antenna design. A unit cell consisting of metallic mesh and LC is analyzed and the LC director distribution is obtained. The director data are transformed into permittivity tensors in the entire LC volume and the LC is discretized in electromagnetic (EM) simulation software to perform full-wave periodic boundary simulation to model the anisotropy and inhomogeneity. The discretized model is approximated by a single dielectric block with a new permittivity range for GT7 LC material. A  $10\times10$  RA is fabricated and measured in terms of optical and RF performance. The measured phase shift of the unit cell is 260° when the voltage is increased from 0 to 40 V.

Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have the capacity to intelligently control the wireless propagation environment and compensate for double-path fading attenuation. Thus, this article exploits an active RIS to mitigate RFI by forming an additional path to reflect RFI. Specifically, the model provides a new solution to sup-degree of freedom (DoF) interference suppression, which means that the amount of interferences surpasses the array DoF. We intend to simultaneously design the receive beamforming of large antenna array and reflection coefficients of active RIS to maximize the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Moreover, the system model can be correlated with a non-Euclidean graph structure due to its graph-like nature. To achieve this objective, a deep-learning (DL) approach, named the location awareness graph ordering attention (LAGOAT) network, is presented to map the locations of RFI and array into the receive beamforming and reflection coefficients. The simulations not only demonstrate that our proposed system can improve significantly the received SINR but also show that proposed LAGOAT network can achieve superior performance compared with other DL approaches, namely, graph neural network (GNN), graph attention network (GAT), and the network without GOAT.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3331511","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U1831117,51877015,U20A20157,U1931129,11403054,62261047); NSFC-Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT)(grant numbers:11611130023 (CH2015-6360)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10319297","Array signal processing;deep learning (DL);graph neural network (GNN);interference mitigation;large antenna array;reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)","Antenna arrays;Array signal processing;Interference;Satellites;Receiving antennas;Deep learning;Signal to noise ratio","","3","","52","IEEE","15 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method allows for the estimation of resonant frequencies associated with each scatterer and the determination of relative resonator positions. The approach relies on an imaging algorithm that evaluates the positions of the resonators by considering a single-frequency point corresponding to the resonant frequency of each scatterer. Consequently, the proposed method does not seek to image the shape of the metal scatterers but rather to locate their positions geometrically for different frequencies. Indeed, once the resonance frequencies have been detected, a geometric representation of the backscattered field is created by limiting the observable frequency band to the resonance frequencies. The use of individual processing with single-frequency steps enables the distinction of the side-by-side gap between resonators, even at resolutions below the conventional image resolution. Furthermore, this method has the capability to differentiate the gap spacing, which can be as small as  ${\lambda /8}$ , between resonators operating at different resonance frequencies. This technique significantly increases the coding capacity associated with the chipless tag. A proof of concept (PoC) is evaluated based on loop resonators for identification (ID) purposes. Then, anechoic and real scenario measurements (3-D displacement table and conveyor belt) are considered in different acquisition configurations.

Extended from physics-informed supervised residual learning (PhiSRL), PhiGRL emulates the computation of a fixed-point iteration method to iteratively modify a candidate solution until convergence by applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict modifications. The application of GNNs enables PhiGRL to adaptively deal with unstructured data and varying unknown numbers in 3-D EM modeling, where most off-the-shelf DL techniques are inapplicable. PhiGRL is first applied to solve the combined-field integral equations (CFIEs) of basic 3-D perfect electric conductor (PEC) targets, including spheroids, conical frustums, and hexahedrons, in both supervised and unsupervised learning manners. Its generalization abilities on different incident frequencies and target shapes are then verified separately.

However, the reception of coherent FDA systems employing small FOs and achieving high transmit gain can be further improved. To this end, this work proposes an coherent airborne FDA radar receiver that explores the orthogonality of echo signals in the Doppler domain, allowing a joint space–time processing module to be deployed to separate the aliased returns.

The distinctions between the dynamic Drude model and the traditional static Drude model are discussed theoretically. In the SETD process, Galerkin’s method is used for space discretization, and a central difference scheme is employed for temporal discretization. Dynamic Drude model comprehensively takes into account the motion state of electrons in plasma driven by EM fields under the action of GHz EM wave and external constant magnetic field. Numerical results from dynamic and static Drude models are in good agreement under the action of low-power microwaves and low-dc magnetic fields.

The spatial extent of the sources in relation to the wavelength determines, in general, the necessary spatial sample density of the observations. If the plane-wave spectrum of the sources is restricted in its extent, as in the case of directive antennas, the spatial sample density and the corresponding acquisition time can, however, be reduced considerably. In order to take advantage of this, an inverse source solver is presented and analyzed, which imposes filtering of the plane-wave spectrum of the localized source distribution during the solution process. The solver is based on propagating plane-wave representations as known from the multilevel fast multipole method (MLFMM), where, however, also Weyl translation operators (TLOPs) are utilized, which have here advantages as compared with the common FMM TLOPs. The functionality of the inverse source solver with spectral filtering is demonstrated for directive antennas utilizing planar and quasi-planar observation data. It is found that the observation sample step size can be increased up to several wavelengths, while spatial diagnostics of antenna faults is still possible. Moreover, considerable computational speedup and reduced memory requirements are observed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3322561","German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action(grant numbers:50RK2221C); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10284581","Antenna diagnostics;antenna measurements;integral equations;inverse problems;iterative solutions;near-field (NF) far-field (FF) transformation","Antenna measurements;Mathematical models;Directive antennas;Wavelength measurement;Size measurement;Probes;Velocity measurement","","8","","54","IEEE","12 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, physical constraints on this permittivity (real part superior to 1, imaginary part negative or null) allow us to solve a polynomial equation derived from the Fresnel reflection coefficients. As we consider co-pol ratios, we alleviate the requirements for calibration for the intensity and the phase of the radar returns.

This article proposes to establish a primitive scatterer dictionary (PSD) following the criteria of atomicity, completeness, extensibility, and pixel-wise independence. By sorting out the geometric structure of the smallest atomic geometric unit in common high-frequency approximation methods, the proposed scatterer dictionary consists of primitive 0-D point, 1-D line, and 2-D surface scatterers, being either straight or curved. A unified bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF) is derived to analytically model the multidimensional scattering dependences on target attributes, position parameters, and sensor observation configurations. It is further extended to model most typical double and triple scattering structures. The efficacy and applicability of PSD are demonstrated by comparing it to numerical methods in various cases including the commonly seen attributed scattering center (ASC) models.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3321386","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61991422); Doctoral Fund of National Key Lab of Microwave Imaging Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10274648","Bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF);primitive scatterer dictionary (PSD);semantic-centric electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling","Scattering;Radar imaging;Radar;Radar scattering;Dictionaries;Semantics;Numerical models","","4","","44","IEEE","9 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A cold wave is cold air that rapidly intensifies and intrudes a region with strong winds, a dry air mass, and precipitation, which affects the air–sea interactions and eventually affects the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves over the sea. However, there are few studies of over-the-horizon (OTH) propagation in evaporation duct during a cold wave. In this article, the path loss (PL) and atmospheric factors of two OTH propagation links over the Bohai Strait and Yellow Sea were observed during a cold wave in November 2021. The cold wave caused PL to decrease over 35.9 and 44.2 dB, respectively, at links over the Bohai Strait and Yellow Sea, as the evaporation duct height (EDH) simulated from the measured data increased 5.9 and 7.6 m. According to the sensitivity analysis, high wind speed (WS) was the main factor promoting seawater evaporation during the cold wave, while a decrease in air temperature (AT) had the opposite effect.

The state transition matrix (STM) is obtained from the measured S-parameters. Combining the obtained STM and the PBS theorem results in an efficient inversion algorithm. The proposed methodology avoids solving the nonlinear integro-differential equation, which is mathematically cumbersome. The validity of the method is investigated by analyzing some examples of nonuniform coupled transmission lines, which are simulated and measured experimentally. It has been shown from the established results that the proposed method leads to an accurate and robust technique for solving the 1-D inverse scattering problem on nonuniform coupled transmission lines.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3333553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10326462","Inverse problems;multiconductor transmission lines;transmission line theory","Inverse problems;Transmission line matrix methods;Voltage;Mathematical models;Scattering;Power transmission lines;Microwave filters","","1","","62","IEEE","22 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The HEM $_{31\delta }^{\mathrm {x}}$ , HEM $_{31\delta }^{\mathrm {y}}$ , TE $_{02\delta + 1}$ , and TM $_{02\delta }$  modes of the cylindrical DRA are utilized. For a solid cylindrical DRA, the TM $_{02\delta }$ -mode frequency is lower than those of the HEM $_{31\delta }^{\mathrm {x,y}}$  and TE $_{02\delta + 1}$  modes, which is an obstacle to the diversity design. In the central DR region, the E-field of the TM $_{02\delta }$  mode is strong, but those of the HEM $_{31\delta }^{\mathrm {x,y}}$  and TE $_{02\delta + 1}$  modes are relatively weak. Therefore, decreasing the relative permittivity of that region by introducing a hollow can increase the TM $_{02\delta }$ -mode frequency, with much smaller effects on the HEM $_{31\delta }^{x,y}$  and TE $_{02\delta + 1}$  modes. In this way, the frequencies of the DRA modes can be made closer to one another. A hollow cylindrical glass DRA is employed to demonstrate this idea. The broadside  ${y}$ -polarized HEM $_{31\delta }^{\mathrm {x}}$  and  ${x}$ -polarized HEM $_{31\delta }^{\mathrm {y}}$  modes are excited through two groups of notched aperture pairs. These four apertures are equally fed to excite the horizontally polarized omnidirectional TE $_{02\delta +1}$  mode. Finally, a probe is used to excite the vertically polarized omnidirectional TM $_{02\delta }$  mode.

The proposed FSS consists of two patch antennas with different slots, a ground, and a metalized via connecting two patch antennas. The antenna’s radiation nulls are generated by slots embedded in the patches, which act as a notch band and can be used to modulate the FSS frequency response with two TZs by varying the length of slots. The high-frequency selectivity performance of FSSs can be achieved without additional circuits or multilayer structures. For a potential application, we design a filtering folded reflectarray (FRA) by using the proposed FSS as its subreflectarray.

Each element is configured as an aperture-coupled patch antenna composed of a radiating patch, a slotted ground for feed of the patch, a microstrip delay line, and a p-i-n diode switch. Unlike conventional methods, the p-i-n diode switch is not placed on the microstrip line but instead is inserted strategically at the center of the coupling slot on the ground layer. In this novel configuration, the elements of the RRA do not endure the loss through the p-i-n diode switches. The loss associated with the p-i-n diode in the proposed configuration is very small since only a small part of the RF currents flows through the diode in the ON state. Two phase states with a phase difference of 180°±20° are realized from 4.9 to 5.7 GHz. The reflection loss of each element is limited to less than 0.1 dB in both the ON and OFF states. To demonstrate the feasibility and performances of the proposed approach, a  $14\times14$ -elements RRA is fabricated and measured. The measured aperture efficiency is above 18.8% in the entire band of 4.9–5.7 GHz, with a peak value of 36.5%. Furthermore, the efficiency stays almost unchanged, even when the equivalent resistor of the p-i-n diode varies from 0.9 to  $9 \Omega $ .

The VIE using uniform Cartesian grids is first built, and then the entire volumetric domain is partitioned into geometric subdomains based on the regularity and topology of the nanostructure. The block diagonal matrix is thus established, whose inverse matrix serves as a preconditioner for the original matrix equation. The resulting linear system is solved by the biconjugate gradient-stabilized (BiCGSTAB) method with different residual error tolerances in the inner and outer iteration processes and the FFT algorithm is used to accelerate the matrix–vector product (MVM) operations throughout. Furthermore, because of the independence between the inner processes of solving block matrix equations, the OpenMP framework is employed to execute the parallel operations. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method is effective and reduces both the iteration number and the computational time significantly for representative nanoelectromagnetic problems like the dielectric focusing metasurfaces and the plasmonic solar cells.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3331512","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61975177,U20A20164); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10325415","Block preconditioner;fast Fourier transform (FFT);nanostructures;OpenMP;volume integral equation (VIE)","Nanostructures;Method of moments;Impedance;Dielectrics;Integral equations;Electromagnetics;Costs","","1","","33","IEEE","21 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A probe-free retrieval approach is proposed to build the measurement matrix based on a small number of designed tests instead of probing the field distribution. Such a probe-free approach does not require experimentally probing field distribution which may bring errors to the measured field due to the perturbation of probes, and hence greatly improves the accuracy of the measurement matrix and, therefore, the sensing resolution.

However, the employed directional antenna pattern will be inherently embedded in the radio channels, leading to distorted measured spatial profiles. State-of-the-art antenna deembedding strategies typically necessitate knowledge of the complex radiation pattern of the employed directional antenna, which is challenging at high-frequency bands.

The proposed approach offers several key advantages, including the efficient calculation of the phase distribution across the metasurface and at each unit cell using an efficient and straightforward design formula, eliminating the need for time-consuming optimization algorithms. Moreover, the design phase formula is independent of the wavelength, allowing for its extension to various frequency bands. Geometric phase theory is used to design a unit cell where any reflection phase value from 0° to 360° can be achieved by rotating the resonator in each unit cell. Then the proposed symmetric cubic phase distribution can be applied to the metasurface aperture. When circularly polarized (CP), linearly polarized (LP), and elliptically polarized (EP) plane waves illuminate the metasurface, both simulated and experimental results demonstrate that the polarization-insensitive metasurface with symmetric cubic phase distribution can substantially reduce the RCS and achieve diffusive scattering patterns. The scattering is significantly suppressed and exceeds 10 dB of RCS reduction from 11 to 28 GHz resulting in a fractional bandwidth (FBW) = 87.1%.

We demonstrate the matching technique for a highly coupled asymmetric three-element dipole antenna array and show that the TARC for the worst case scenario is smaller than both conjugate and 50- $\Omega $  matchings.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3336380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341271","Maximum power transfer theorem (MPTT);multiport network;phased array;radiation efficiency;total active reflection coefficient (TARC)","Antenna arrays;Impedance;Transducers;Antennas;Reflection coefficient;Linear systems;Scattering","","3","","5","IEEE","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We point out that this equality is valid in certain cases only and is usually not represented in practice. The reasons for this statement are centered on the difference between available and input power, and the assumption of dealing with a lossless multiport antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3336373","Czech Science Foundation(grant numbers:21-19025M); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341290","Antenna array;antenna efficiency;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);radiation efficiency;total active reflection coefficient (TARC)","Transducers;Antenna arrays;Antennas;Reflector antennas;Reflection coefficient;Generators;Broadband antennas","","","","9","IEEE","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
