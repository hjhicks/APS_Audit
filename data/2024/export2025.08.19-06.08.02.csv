An H-plane GW horn antenna with transverse slot-based slow wave (SW) structures is designed as the array element. By compensating the phase error along the horn aperture, the antenna length is greatly reduced, while the gain is enhanced. To suppress the strong mutual coupling between adjacent elements due to the small spacing, an efficient DN is proposed by introducing a through slot inside the intermediate sidewall between adjacent antenna elements. With this DN, an extra wideband equal-magnitude and antiphase signal can be generated to cancel the coupling signals. Based on the contactless characteristic of the GW, the presented antenna can be extended to large-scale arrays with high reliability. An eight-element phased array antenna operating at 24–30 GHz is implemented for verification. The antenna length is reduced by 62.2% compared with the optimum horn antenna, and the mutual coupling is reduced by up to 32.7 dB with the DN. The measured array gain is higher than 19.8 dBi and the scan angle reaches ±60° with a scan loss of less than 4.5 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3347878","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0205900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61904137,62131013); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:SBK2023040355); Basic Research Plan of Natural Science of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2021GY-006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10381614","Decoupling network (DN);gap waveguide (GW);horn antenna;phased array;slow wave (SW)","Phased arrays;Horn antennas;Antenna arrays;Mutual coupling;Antenna measurements;Metamaterials;Gain","","4","","35","IEEE","4 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article complements the above work treating the influence of the losses. The problem is faced by assuming small losses in terms of surface resistance over the metalized surface of the minimum sphere circumscribing the antenna. The final closed-form formula shows that the maximum gain is obtained by a summation that resembles the well-known Harrington’s sum for maximum directivity, except that the expansion coefficients are weighted by the radiation efficiency of each spherical harmonic. The formulation is then generalized to the case of self-resonant antennas, providing a tighter bound for any losses. For small antennas, we provide a simple interpretation of the field corresponding to the maximum gain in terms of dipolar and quadrupolar source contributions, weighted by the appropriate efficiency, offering a physical insight into the phenomenon. The formulation is then extended to also account for a Q-bound, deriving a final series expression as a function of the loss resistance and the antenna electrical size. This expression seamlessly merges to the previously derived Q-bounded maximum directivity as losses tend to zero and converges to Q-unbounded maximum gain for very large values of Q.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3358977","Huawei Technologies Company Ltd., within the joint Innovation Antenna Laboratory between Huawei and the Department of Information Engineering and Mathematics of the University of Siena; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10418857","Antenna bandwidth;antenna efficiency;quality factor;super-gain;superdirectivity","Antennas;Indexes;Harmonic analysis;Bandwidth;Current;Surface resistance;Q-factor","","5","","30","CCBY","1 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has three monopole radiators spaced by  $0.14\lambda _{0}$  with high isolations of around 20 dB for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) applications. The three radiators are surrounded by a cylindrical dielectric block with a diameter of  $0.30\lambda _{0}$  only. The loaded dielectric block helps to reduce the mutual coupling by providing dielectric-air boundaries. In addition, it modifies the  $E$ -field distribution to generate three coplanar polarizations. As can be shown by the envelope correlation coefficients (ECCs) based on radiation patterns, the proposed module can provide three independent channels for MIMO applications. Compared with an ideal single-input-single-output (SISO) system, our module can reach an ergodic channel capacity of around 282%. Based on the DLA module, a compact high-gain hexagonal antenna array (HAA) with coplanar tripolarization is proposed for long-distance MIMO applications. Dielectric-filled bow-tie-shaped slots are employed between DLA modules to reduce the intermodule mutual coupling. Moreover, a hexagonal artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) structure is arranged on the backside to reduce the backside lobes. As a result, a measured realized gain of more than 12 dBi is obtained for each polarization.

By leveraging the transmission characteristics of the ESSPPs mode, a wideband filter is devised. Compared to ESPPs filters, the effective permittivity of each layer of ESSPPs determines only one cutoff frequency, allowing independent control of passband and out-of-band. Furthermore, the filter’s skirt selectivity can be enhanced without elongating the filter, which is advantageous for achieving compactness. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate the filter’s capacity for independently controllable cutoff frequencies, a consistently stable stopband, and a deep out-of-band rejection. The dispersion relationship of the ESSPPs mode is illustrated, followed by an examination of the control over cutoff frequencies. To validate our design, the filter is integrated with a Vivaldi antenna to create a filtenna. A prototype of the filtenna is produced using multilayer printed circuit boards (PCBs).

As a critical component of SMWA, the flexible conformal array (FCA) is responsible for the spatial energy radiation distribution, it can not only ensure that the energy radiated to the target area is maximized but also ensure that the energy radiated to the interference area is minimized. However, achieving the desired pattern in any direction of the airspace with the traditional static array can be challenging because the radiation in the edge direction of the array widens the mainlobe sharply. Therefore, this article proposes a scheme that combines array design and pattern synthesis based on FCA characteristics to obtain a desired radiation distribution. The framework of the algorithm is composed of array control parameter (ACP) optimization and derivative-limited pattern synthesis, while considering factors that may affect the radiation distribution during the actual operation of FCA, such as array mutual coupling and ACP errors. The objective function of ACP optimization is to maximize radiation energy in the desired direction and minimize it in the interference direction. Using the obtained optimal ACP, the adaptive covariance update optimization problem is solved under derivative constraints, and the closed expression of the array weighting vector is obtained. Theoretical and simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm framework outperforms the traditional array in terms of antenna radiation performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3366236","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171092); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2018RZ0141); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10443786","Array design;flexible conformal array (FCA);mutual coupling;pattern synthesis;smart morphing wing aircraft (SMWA)","Mutual coupling;Adaptive arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Vectors;Heuristic algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Deformation","","4","","46","IEEE","22 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mechanical antennas driven by acoustic oscillation or external mechanical movements have been proven to be promising candidates for low-frequency (LF) transmitters. Unfortunately, the mechanical relaxation in modulation caused by the motion inertia of mechanical antennas limits modulation rates. Here, we developed a high-rate active phase modulation (APM) scheme that can eliminate the mechanical relaxation and approach the theoretical maximal bit rate in a magnetoelectric (ME) antenna. The proposed ME antenna is based on a three-layered acoustic resonator with a length of only 8 cm and a total efficiency of  $3.59\times 10^{-14}$ , which is closer to Chu’s limit. The proposed APM is realized by the 180° phase reversal of the bias magnetic field provided by a modulating coil. The high bit rate of 18 kbps at the resonant frequency of 27.75 kHz is demonstrated by using APM, one order of magnitude higher than that of passive phase modulation (PPM) due to the effective suppression of mechanical relaxation in such 180° phase variation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3363466","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3201800); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62131017,62101424,62071374,62101423); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:xzy012020003); National 111 Project of China(grant numbers:B14040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10439013","Active modulation;magnetoelectric (ME) antennas;very low frequency (VLF)","Magnetic resonance;Antennas;Magnetoacoustic effects;Magnetostriction;Magnetic moments;Dipole antennas;Modulation","","10","","59","IEEE","16 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effects of higher order modes on an instrument associated with wider bandwidths have been reported, which may degrade observation precision. It is important to quantify the higher order propagation modes, though their power is too small to measure directly. Instead of the direct measurement of modes, we make an attempt to deduce them based on measurable radiation patterns. Assuming a linear system, whose radiated field is determined as a superposition of the mode coefficients in an instrument, we obtain a coefficient matrix connecting the modes and the radiated field and calculate the pseudoinverse matrix. To investigate the accuracy of the proposed method, we demonstrate two cases with numerical simulations, axially corrugated horn case and offset Cassegrain antenna case, and the effect of random errors on the precision. Both the cases showed the deduced mode coefficients with a precision of 10−6 with respect to the maximum mode amplitude and 10−3 degrees in phase, respectively. The calculation errors were observed when the random errors were smaller than 0.01% of the maximum radiated field amplitude, which was a much lower level compared with measurement precision. The demonstrated method works independently of the details of a system. The method can quantify the propagation modes inside an instrument and will be applied to most of the linear components and antennas, which leads to various applications such as diagnosis of feed alignment and higher performance feed design.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3366310","JST, the Establishment of University Fellowships Toward the Creation of Science Technology Innovation(grant numbers:JPMJFS 2138); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10443854","Antenna radiation patterns;characteristic mode analysis;electromagnetic (EM) propagation;feeds;radio astronomy","Transmission line matrix methods;Power transmission lines;Extraterrestrial measurements;Transmission line measurements;Feeds;Vectors;Mathematical models","","","","27","IEEE","22 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional on-chip patch antennas use the bottommost metal layer (M1) as the ground, securing a high degree of isolation from the active region. However, this method considerably confines the antenna profile, substantially limiting the antenna bandwidth. In this article, a dual-patch structure is proposed to overcome this challenge. Remarkably, even under an extremely low profile of  $0.013 \lambda _{0}$ , the designed antennas accomplish an impedance bandwidth exceeding 15%. In addition, the intrinsic characteristics of the dual-patch structure generate multiple radiation nulls, paving the way for the design of a filtering antenna built upon this structure. Two antennas with and without filtering were fabricated using 65 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology for empirical validation. Measurement shows that the gain-optimized antenna reaches an impedance bandwidth of 15.5% and a peak gain of 3.1 dBi. Meanwhile, the filtering antenna achieves an impedance bandwidth of 15.3% and a maximum gain of 1.6 dBi. The filtering antenna demonstrates good stopband suppression and distinctive radiation nulls.

To avoid serious consequences, DVT requires early detection, timely medication, and daily monitoring. Thus, a handheld scanner based on electromagnetic techniques is proposed to meet those requirements. The device houses a four-channel body-matched antenna array. Each channel consists of two slotted patch antennas fed through an equal power divider. To enhance isolation between antenna elements and improve directionality, each element is embedded within a substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW). Moreover, each channel is orthogonal to the others to achieve radiation diversity. The antenna array covers the ultrawideband (1.2–10 GHz) and thus achieves the required penetration and resolution to detect clots in deep veins. Each channel exhibits symmetrical and unidirectional radiation patterns that produce a stable main beam directed to the imaging domain with a front-to-back ratio (FBR) and penetration efficiency of more than 18 dB and 80%, respectively. Since most DVT cases occur in the lower limbs, near the knees, the device is tested on knee phantoms. A double-stage confocal imaging algorithm is used to generate 2-D images of the knee in axial and sagittal planes. The simulated and experimental results show that small (3.5 mm) and multiple DVT clotting can be successfully detected, indicating the clinical potential of the device.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3367421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10452265","Deep vein thrombosis (DVT);electromagnetic imaging (EMI);electromagnetic scanner;substrate integrated waveguide antenna;wideband antenna","Antenna arrays;Veins;Antennas;Resonant frequency;Electromagnetic interference;Substrates;Power dividers","","4","","61","IEEE","27 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examining these solutions as a function of frequency reveals clear modal transitions that directly affect radiation behavior. Specifically, we demonstrate that the radiation modes are well suited to identify and quantify changes in radiation behavior, because their solutions are decoupled from the energy storage properties of an antenna.

The predicted dimensions, including the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) layouts, values of the etched capacitors, and WPT distances, meet the design purposes.

Different from the traditional method that focuses on widebeam antenna element, this novel method aims to directly obtain widebeam active element pattern (AEP) by skillfully using the near-field coupling effect between elements. Meanwhile, the port self-decoupling technique is introduced in phased arrays to obtain high port isolation. As a result, without adding any beam-broadening structure and decoupling structure, the phased array, featuring extremely simple structure and excellent beam-scanning performance, can be constructed by a typical narrow-beam antenna element. As examples, two millimeter-wave (mm-wave) eight-element linear phased arrays are designed based on a microstrip patch antenna (MPA) and a dielectric resonator antenna (DRA), respectively. Although the half-power beamwidths (HPBWs) of the two antenna elements are only 96° and 94°, the beam-scanning ranges of their corresponding phased arrays reach ±63° and ±61°, respectively. For verification, a prototype of the proposed mm-wave MPA phased array is fabricated and measured. The results show that this phased array can scan from −64° to +64° with a very low gain fluctuation of 1.0 dB (varying between 13.5 and 14.5 dBi), and the peak sidelobe level (SLL) is less than −8.3 dB over the wide scanning range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3369755","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807303); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271211,61922031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10458012","Active element pattern (AEP);dielectric resonator antenna (DRA);microstrip patch antenna (MPA);millimeter-wave (mm-wave) antenna;phased array;self-decoupling;wide-angle beam-scanning","Phased arrays;Couplings;Design methodology;Microstrip antenna arrays;Gain;Dielectric resonator antennas;Dipole antennas","","5","","38","IEEE","1 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For an ideal phase shifter, the amplitude is constant and the output phase changes linearly with the control voltage. However, the practical phase shifters show a nonlinear behavior in both amplitude and phase with respect to the control voltage. The main objective of this article is to design a deep neural network (DNN), which estimates the optimum voltage values of the phase shifter using the noisy data of the receiver antenna array. The proposed approach is general and extendible to any array geometry. Usually, the quality of the trained model is affected by large variations in the voltage values for certain adjacent directions of arrival (DOAs). To overcome this issue, we introduce the robust mapping technique, which avoids sudden changes in voltage values during the training process. The amplitude and phase data of a typical reflective-type phase shifter is measured for different control voltage values, to be used in the training process. The suggested algorithm is applied to a receiver array of four antennas with reflective-type phase shifters (RTPSs). The maximum array gain for different DOAs is very close to the optimum results showing the superior performance of the proposed method. Compared to the existing methods, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the array gain decreased to 0.0283. It is shown that the proposed method is more resilient to noise and performs substantially better than other methods in low SNR scenarios.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3360637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10423587","Beamforming;deep learning;machine learning;neural network;phase shifter;phased array","Phase shifters;Phased arrays;Voltage control;Array signal processing;Antenna arrays;Voltage measurement;Arrays","","1","","24","IEEE","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, full-wave analysis is required to model RAs with failures. Unfortunately, this places a tremendous computational burden on any attempt at reoptimizing the RA to heal its performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce here an efficient method that exploits adjoint optimization (AO) to make RA healing tractable. To demonstrate the approach, a  $25\times25$  element RA is analyzed under multiple failure scenarios to determine the expected gain recovery after optimization.

The coverage and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation performance of SOLSA and other six conventional different array architectures are simulated and compared. It can be concluded from the simulation results that the performance of the DoA estimation is improved compared with a uniform L-shaped array (ULSA).

The CPC unit cell comprises two identical filtennas and two matching vias. Each filtenna consists of a magneto-electric (ME) dipole antenna and a ground plane with four L-shaped resonators. The matching vias not only match the two filtennas but also enable a 1-bit phase resolution of the CPC. First, modes of the filtennas and the matching vias are investigated independently. Afterward, the filtennas are arranged back-to-back and orthogonal, and connected using the matching vias, forming an FA-T-FA CPC. This configuration allows linearly polarized waves to be transformed into their orthogonal counterparts upon passing through the CPC. Four transmission modes of the CPC are generated, leading to a −3 dB fractional bandwidth of 17.9%, a polarization conversion ratio (PCR) of 99%, and an energy conversion ratio (ECR) of 94% in the passband. The lower and upper rejection bands of the CPC benefit from the ME dipole antennas and the L-shaped resonators, respectively. Moreover, the proposed CPC can maintain a stable response under the incidence angle of 55°. To validate its efficacy, the FA-T-FA CPC is fabricated and measured. Simulation and measurement results demonstrate a reasonable agreement, affirming the practical viability of the proposed CPC.

The proposed structure mainly incorporates two dielectric layers, two metal-patterned layers equipped with varactors and resistors, and an intermediate metal cross layer for electrical connections. This coherent absorber is evaluated based on full-wave simulations. When a single electromagnetic wave is incident vertically from one side of the structure, two adjacent peaks are produced with absorption efficiencies of about 50%. The structure is then positioned in the standing wave field created by two counter-propagating coherent waves, where the two peak amplitudes can be selectively enhanced or weakened by adjusting the phase difference between the coherent waves. Moreover, by modulating the reverse voltage across the varactors, the capacitance of the varactors is altered, thereby enabling the tunability of the absorption frequency. Two coherent absorption peaks with phase differences of  $\phi $  = 0° and  $\phi $  = 180° are deliberately designed to be significantly enhanced within distinct frequency ranges. As a result, a CPA with a wide tunable frequency range within 2.3–6.6 GHz is synthesized, where the absorption rates of 2.3–3.8 and 4.25–6.59 GHz exceed 90%.

In order to ensure inversion accuracy, the conventional solvers for the EM inverse scattering (EMIS) problems usually require EM scattered field information originating from multiple incident EM waves, resulting in tedious measurement operation and considerable measurement data for inversion computation. Thus, the conventional solvers are difficult to suit for real-time quantitative EM problems, which require relatively simple measurement operations and small measurement data dimensions. To overcome these challenges, a novel EM inversion solver is proposed based on a conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (CDCGAN). The proposed CDCGAN includes the generator with an EM scattering simulator and the corresponding discriminator, both consisting of complex-valued deep convolutional neural networks (DConvNets). The trained CDCGAN can be successfully applied to inhomogeneous and high-contrast scatterers only by employing one single incident EM wave in single-frequency and far-field measurement, which greatly simplifies measurement and reduces the computation complexity for its further inversion computation. Numerical examples have indicated the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed DL-based inversion solver, which acts as the potential candidate for solving real-time quantitative EM problems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3369683","Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:GRF 17207114,GRF 17210815,GRF 12300218,GRF 12300519,GRF 17201020,GRF 17300021,C1013-21GF,C7004-21GF,Joint NSFC-RGC N-HKU76921,GRF 12306616,GRF 12200317,GRF 12300218,GRF 12300519); Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development (AOARD)(grant numbers:FA2386-17-1-0010); NSFC(grant numbers:61271158); Hong Kong University Grants Committee (UGC)(grant numbers:AoE/P–04/08); HKU(grant numbers:104005583); Fellowship Award from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:HKU PDFS2122-7S05); Hong Kong Research Grants Council (HKRGC) Collaborative Research Fund (CRF)(grant numbers:C7004-21GF); Joint NSFC and RGC(grant numbers:N-HKU769/21); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10458047","Conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN);deep learning;electromagnetic inverse scattering (EMIS);microwave imaging","Generators;Electromagnetic interference;Image reconstruction;Costs;Training;Mathematical models;Electromagnetics","","5","","49","IEEE","4 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Anomalous refractors, electromagnetic devices capable of altering the direction of incident plane-waves, have gained significant attention in recent research. Various design approaches have been explored, necessitating a comprehensive comparison to identify the optimal approach. This study evaluates the effectiveness of three different approaches for the design of three-layer anomalous refractors and provides criteria for the selection of the optimal one. The first two approaches employ local approximations, deriving sheet admittance profiles analytically based on the uniform problem matching the local structure. These approaches are referred to as impedance-equalized Huygens’ (IEH) MTS and omega-type bianisotropic (O-BMS) MTS. The third approach, denoted as Floquet-modes optimization (FM-OPT), introduces a numerical technique based on surface field harmonics optimization. In this case, a user-specified number of evanescent Floquet modes (FMs) is employed in the optimization procedure for minimizing the real part of the admittance sheets. The aforementioned approaches are compared for the design of three-layer anomalous refractors performing three different anomalous refractions 0°-to-20°/50°/80° for two different interlayer distances. An ad hoc multilayer analysis tool based on FM expansion is developed to accurately analyze and compare the designed anomalous refractors. The numerical results indicate that, for practical applications, the FM-OPT approach outperforms both the IEH and O-BMS approaches in terms of performance and accuracy.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3371716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10464205","Anomalous refraction;metasurfaces (MTSs);periodic structures;phase gradient;surface wave","Admittance;Surface impedance;Frequency modulation;Surface waves;Magnetoelectric effects;Optimization;Impedance","","2","","47","IEEE","8 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these methods may fail to reconstruct high-quality images in practical applications due to training data limitations. In this article, we consider this problem within a meta-learning framework. In this framework, the SA-ISAR imaging network is trained by a learnable optimizer instead of a fixed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. A fully connected network is designed as an optimizer for imaging network training; this network is also called a meta-learner. The whole training procedure in the proposed framework is divided into two parts. In the first part, a suitable meta-learner is trained. In the second part, the well-trained meta-learner is applied to train the ISAR imaging network.

As a result, it is challenging and sometimes even infeasible to apply the FDTD method to applications involving very small time step increments relative to the wavelengths of interest or when time spans involving a very large number of wavelengths are of interest. This article proposes a technique for allowing FDTD models to periodically skip time steps during the simulation while remaining stable and providing a level of accuracy that is suitable for many applications.

However, this equation suffers from ill-conditioning and deleterious numerical effects in the low-frequency regime, often jeopardizing its solution. This can be fixed using quasi-Helmholtz decompositions, in which the source and testing elements are separated into their solenoidal and nonsolenoidal contributions, and then rescaled to avoid both the low-frequency conditioning breakdown and the loss of numerical accuracy. However, standard quasi-Helmholtz decompositions require handling discretized differential operators that often worsen the mesh refinement ill-conditioning and require the finding of the topological cycles of the geometry, which can be expensive when modeling complex scatterers, especially in high-order. This article solves these drawbacks by presenting the first extension of the quasi-Helmholtz projectors to high-order discretizations and their application to the stabilization of the EFIE when discretized with high-order basis functions.

This article summarizes extensive measurements and statistical analysis of outdoor radio propagation data collected in New York City between 2012 and 2021 to formulate a multiband empirical 3-D statistical channel model (SCM) for outdoor urban open squares and streets. Path loss (PL) models and SCMs are derived from over 21 000 power delay profiles (PDPs) measured in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Analysis of multipath components (MPCs) in PDPs reveals underlying statistical distributions for wireless channel parameters, including time-clusters (TCs), subpaths (SP) in TCs, delays and powers of TCs and SP, and spatial-cluster directions. Observations at 142 GHz suggest a sparse channel as SP in TCs are exponentially distributed with narrower spread spatial-clusters and higher Ricean K-factor, unlike the uniform distributions and lower K-factors at 28 and 73 GHz. The proposed SCMs at 142, 73, and 28 GHz extend the open-source NYUSIM channel simulator into sub-THz bands up to 150 GHz. The SCMs aid in designing modems, antenna arrays, beamforming, and spatial multiplexing approaches, while providing an empirical baseline for propagation simulation and prediction tools such as ray tracers.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3366581","NYU Research Catalyst Prize through the NYU WIRELESS Industrial Affiliates Program; National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:1909206,2037845,2216332); NSF(grant numbers:1555332,1302336,1320472); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10444718","Channel modeling;millimeter wave (mmWave) receivers;propagation measurements;radio propagation;urban propagation","Wireless communication;Channel models;Radio propagation;Millimeter wave communication;Correlation;Antenna measurements;Three-dimensional displays","","17","","66","CCBYNCND","23 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed QD-RT method is applied in a realistic street canyon scenario in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band, and the performance of the QD-RT method is verified by the deterministic propagation method, where the second-order statistics, including root-mean-square (rms) delay spread and angular spread, and the first-order statistic transfer function yield good agreements.

Research in the literature suggested statistically modeling the signal attenuation in foggy links. However, the proposed distribution is mathematically intractable, and further investigations were based on simulations and imposing restrictions on the distribution parameters. In this article, irradiance distributions for optical waves propagating through a random distribution of particles are derived based on the Rytov theory. The distribution parameters are explicitly related to the channel physical characteristics. Moreover, general distributions describing signal fading due to the combined effect of turbulence, pointing errors, and scattering particles are also derived. In case of a foggy link, use is made of the generalized Meijer-G function to derive closed-form expressions without undue restrictions on the distribution parameters. Closed-form expressions of the corresponding average bit error rate (ABER) for optical wireless communication (OWC) under many modulation schemes are derived. Spatial diversity is also considered through single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. The work in this article shows that, within the complete scattering theory, significant system losses exist beyond those previously reported in the literature, and this should be accounted for in the link budget design of optical wireless links.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3365870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10443329","Coherent intensity;extension cross section;incoherent intensity;Rytov theory;scattering amplitude;scintillation;turbulence-induced fading","Optical scattering;Adaptive optics;Scattering;Optical attenuators;Optical receivers;Attenuation;Fading channels","","1","","40","IEEE","21 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method uses the free-form deformation (FFD) technique to parameterize the shape optimization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a new method for efficient computation of the Jacobian matrix by analyzing the sensitivity of the scattered field with respect to the location of control points in the FFD.

First, a diagnosis system that performs direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation without phase information using the Rotman lens at 28 GHz is designed. A true real-time DoA estimation extracting the DoA data directly from the microcontroller unit (MCU) is implemented. Second, the propagation of EM waves in a miniaturized realistic environment where random reflection and scattering exist is diagnosed, instead of performing under ideal environments such as an anechoic chamber. EM wave control elements are installed using actual DoA information, instead of hypotheses, which relies on the geometry of the space where antennas or EM wave control elements are placed. Finally, the EM field modified by the devised EM wave control elements is reconfirmed using the DoA system. The method is exemplified using two distinct environments in which the aforementioned diagnosis and modification procedures are used to derive the specific EM skin configurations. Each configuration yielded an improvement of received power by 13.2 and 12.1 dB, respectively.

Here, the two dielectric media are assumed to be ordinary. Meanwhile, directly calculating the original double integral representation may be difficult and inefficient when the distance between the antenna and the observation point is very large. Because the complete uniform asymptotic expansion (AE) is known for the SI for the impedance plane, the double integral can be reduced to a single integral by simply replacing the integrand with a known AE. The single integral has a finite integral range as  $[0,\pi /2]$ . On the basis of the identical replacement, the double integral of the DGF can be reduced to a single integral; however, new complete uniform AEs of the first- and second-order spatial derivative of the SI for the impedance case should be formulated. In this study, using uniform expansions, a new complete uniform AE of the DGF is obtained, which is numerically validated for various propagation scenarios. By comparing the simulation results with those of the conventional first- or second-order uniform expansion and two numerical algorithms such as numerical steepest descent path (NSDP) and extreme steepest descent path (ESDP), the numerical complexity, accuracy, and valid region of the new expansion are addressed as well.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3342936","INHA University Research Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10367801","Complete asymptotic expansion (AE);dielectric half-space;dyadic Green’s function (DGF)","Impedance;Dielectrics;Green's function methods;Permittivity;Antennas;Silicon;Mathematical models","","2","","29","IEEE","20 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When measuring a heavy housing, scattered waves from the supporting turntable for the antenna under test (AUT) disturb the electromagnetic field. A technique for eliminating the influence of scattered waves is required to evaluate the abnormal AUT radiation performance. This article proposes a method for estimating the far field when the antenna exists above an infinite conductive plane, using partially spherical near-field measurements that include the turntable. The proposed method estimates the far field by combining the equivalent source reconstruction and the far-field estimation with the reflection coefficient method. In the proposed method, the equivalent source distribution surrounding an AUT is reconstructed from a partially spherical near field to remove the effects of the turntable. Through numerical calculations and experiments, this article shows that the proposed method can estimate the far-field pattern above an infinite conductive plane, with arbitrary electric constants from a partially spherical near field. The far-field estimation error is less than −20 dB when the upper hemispherical near field can be obtained.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3096983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490527","Far-field estimation;near-field measurements;reflection coefficient;source reconstruction","Antenna measurements;Image reconstruction;Surface reconstruction;Mobile antennas;Electric variables measurement;Surface impedance;Conductivity measurement","","2","","24","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a new channel model for RIS that considers these ignored properties, including the reflected field, scattered field, and antenna resonant mode. We verify the proposed model through practical implementation of a  $4\times4$  RIS array with patch antennas in the 3.5-GHz band, using a phase shifter as the switch component of an RIS element. The equivalent model of the phase shifter is also formulated and incorporated into the channel model. We propose a blind controlling algorithm to discuss the properties of our channel model and emphasize the importance of considering polarization and tracking mechanisms for the controlling algorithm.

Yet, a reliable rendition of the system outputs necessitates the employment of electromagnetic (EM) analysis, associated with considerable CPU costs. Global optimization under such circumstances is extremely challenging. This especially applies to nature-inspired algorithms recognized for exceptionally low computational efficacy. Whereas surrogate-assisted approach is of limited use due to difficulties related to the construction of reliable behavioral antenna models. Here, we suggest an innovative methodology for efficient global optimization (EGO) of multiband antennas, where the surrogate is repeatedly built and refined using custom-defined response features.

The antenna element consists of a square patch and a square microstrip loop, which are fed by two separate ports. Importantly, neither any active component in the millimeter-wave frequency band nor any dc biasing circuit is needed in the proposed beam-steerable antenna. The radiation patterns of the loop element in TM22 mode and the patch element in TM10 mode are synthesized with different phases. The radiation beam of the antenna can be switched by only controlling the phase difference between these two ports. Furthermore, by using the proposed beam-steerable antenna element, the element and array factors of the millimeter-wave phased array can be tuned simultaneously. Therefore, a wide scanning angle of the phased array is realized in the E-plane.

Following the theory of characteristic modes (CMs), the CM-based radiation pattern synthesis problem is transformed into a convex optimization problem to constrain modal weighting coefficients (MWCs) and achieve a near-optimal sparse excitation voltage vector. The excited radiation patterns could be predicted from the weighted CMs. The distribution of near-optimal sparse excitation voltage vector provides quantitative information for exciter locations. Furthermore, in the second convex optimization problem, the influence of port coupling among the excitation ports and the input impedance property of each exciter is further considered by the embedded pattern synthesis method.

The antenna consists of a dual-channel filtering feeding circuit, a parallelogram-shaped (PS) radiator, and a dual-band tapered polarizer. In the feeding circuit, a shared dual-mode resonator is adopted to couple with two single-mode resonators in each channel, from which diplexing channels and filtering responses can be achieved. Moreover, a tapered cylindrical waveguide with a pair of nonuniform grooves is employed as a polarizer, overcoming the challenge of simultaneous CP in two nonadjacent bands with enhanced gain and improved polarization purity. To improve the accuracy of 3-D printing fabrication, a PS radiator, which also acts as a mode converter, is utilized between the polarizer and the feeding circuit. For demonstration, a prototype has been designed and measured. With the all-metal 3-D printing technique, the multifunction antenna is fabricated monolithically with a high-integrated geometry.

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been proposed as a promising technology for mitigating the coverage limitations inherent in many microwave and millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless applications. However, wireless links facilitated by RIS are also susceptible to detrimental effects from blockages. In this communication, we present a spatial phase shift distribution (SPSD) method that alleviates adverse effects caused by blockages near RIS, exemplified for mmWave wireless scenarios. The proposed method refines the SPSD by accounting for distortions caused by blockages. This is achieved by modifying the conventional beamforming formula, which typically considers only the beam steering phase distribution between the incident wave and the desired direction. Through numerical simulations and by fabricating an RIS prototype for experimental validation, we demonstrate that the proposed method restores an average signal strength gain of approximately 3.5 dB in various scenarios, compared to traditional beamforming techniques in the presence of blockages. The proposed method can be used to optimize the transmit (TX) power of communication systems using RIS or to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3374202","Samsung Research Funding Center of Samsung Electronics(grant numbers:SRFC-TE2103); Network Business of Samsung Electronics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10471287","Beamforming;blockage;millimeter wave (mmWave);reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS);spatial phase shift distribution (SPSD)","Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces;Array signal processing;Millimeter wave communication;Scattering;Phase distortion;Finite element analysis;Prototypes","","3","","21","IEEE","12 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the automation removes manual interventions and determines the sizes of the subapertures on the fly. Second, an OpenMP-based scheme is developed to parallelize the computation. With the help of a dynamic schedule, the parallelization achieves high scalability with quasilinear speedup. Lastly, the effectiveness of the proposed automatic aperture discretization and parallel AI-SI (AADP AI-SI) is demonstrated by numerical results. The AADP AI-SI improves the accuracy and efficiency of the conventional AI-SI significantly.
