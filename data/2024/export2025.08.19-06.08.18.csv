A theoretical demonstration of this behavior is found by investigating the relationship between the attenuation constant and the aperture efficiency. Meanwhile, double-layer cross-embedded tensor unit cell is proposed, to achieve more continuous surface impedance distribution. Moreover, the attenuation constant  $\alpha $  and conversion efficiency  $\varepsilon _{\mathrm {conv}}$  are improved without enlarging the aperture size and sacrificing the gain bandwidth. In this case, the double-layer topology approaches the theoretical maximum aperture efficiency with compact size. It is worth mentioning that, the proposed method is compatible with both uniform and nonuniform modulated HAs. As a validation, two double-layer HAs designed with the respective uniform and nonuniform modulation index are analyzed, fabricated, and measured. Both are with a compact aperture dimension of  $4.15^{2}~\pi \cdot \lambda _{0}^{2}$  at 26 GHz. Compared with conventional single-layer HA, the first prototype achieves an increased realized gain of 2.3 dB and an aperture efficiency of 44.3%, while the second prototype achieves an enhanced realized gain of 2.8 dB and an aperture efficiency of 49.1%, respectively. The HAs feature compact size, high efficiency, low cost, and planar integration, rendering them good prospects for the 5th generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mm-wave) applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3394211","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62250610223); Major Key Project of Pengcheng Laboratory (PCL); Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BE2021007-2); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242023R40059); Big Data Computing Center at Southeast University for Numerical Calculation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10517906","Attenuation constant;compact size;conversion efficiency;cross-embedded;double-layer;holographic antennas (HAs)","Aperture antennas;Modulation;Impedance;Surface impedance;Antennas;Topology;Substrates","","7","","45","IEEE","2 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the first time, the complex permittivity of the PNLC has been extracted for various doping conditions of reactive mesogen used in the polymer network at the mmWave band. Anisotropic constitutive parameters at the two extreme states of the PNLC can be obtained through a waveguide (WG). A  $1 \times 2$  reflectarray simple cell in the WG enables the establishment of an equivalent circuit (EQ) for an infinite cell array, providing exact modeling for de-embedding. The PNLC has an attractive property compared with pristine nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) owing to its significantly enhanced dynamic switching characteristics. In the mmWave band, the physical cell gap of the liquid crystal (LC) inevitably increases to achieve RF performance, resulting in slow dynamic speed. However, studies on the characterization of PNLCs at the mmWave band are limited, and their evaluation methodologies are inaccurate. The fabricated cell requires no biasing circuit to achieve two extreme phase states, owing to its prealigned layer.

However, the efficiency and portability of wireless communication are greatly limited by the size of the conventional antenna and the large current required. This has stimulated the need for a new approach to low-frequency antenna design. Here, we propose a rotating permanent magnet mechanical antenna (RPMMA) based on a large volume permanent magnet. Based on the mechanical antenna (MA) radiation model, the magnetization direction and radiation efficiency of the single permanent magnets are analyzed. The heteroaxial array magnetic torque model was derived. Radiation patterns and initial phase angles of the two array geometries were analyzed; a transmitter with 16 cylindrical permanent magnets axially magnetized in a coaxial arrangement was determined. Test results show that axial magnetization increases the strength of permanent magnets by 13 dB over radial magnetization for the same volume. The transmitter can generate the time-varying magnetic field strength of 117 pT at 100 m. The experiments also tested the system to verify the feasibility of transmission in air-seawater media.

Different from the previous MNZ segmented loop antenna with the single  $0^{\text {th}}$  mode, the higher order  $1^{\text {st}}$ / $2^{\text {nd}}$ / $3^{\text {rd}}$  modes are also included for broadband purpose. By adjusting the effective permeability through the distributed capacitors in the proposed antenna, the electrical lengths of the  $0^{\text {th}}$ / $1^{\text {st}}$ / $2^{\text {nd}}$ / $3^{\text {rd}}$  modes are reasonably stretched.

In this article, we introduce an innovative approach for reconstructing the electric fields of reflector antennas using simulated data across a range of frequencies. By leveraging the power of sub-Nyquist sampling, the number of required samples can be reduced, leading to increased computational efficiency. This presents an advantage to traditional methods such as the Fourier transform that requires Nyquist sampling.

This method takes a holistic perspective, utilizing the antenna structure to build a shielding cavity and implanting the smaller-sized filter into the larger-sized antenna. To demonstrate the superiority of this method, an FiA prototype is designed by integrating a magneto-electric (ME) dipole and a compact filter. Initially, a metal shielding cavity is built with the M-dipole structure of the low-profile ME dipole. Second, a miniaturized filter is built using multilayer coupling structures. Subsequently, the filter is inserted in the feeding line inside the shielding cavity of the ME dipole. Accordingly, the ME dipole and the multilayer filter are integrated into an FiA.

In this article, a circularly polarized cubic metasurface-based array (CMSA) antenna is proposed for radio frequency identification (RFID) readers used in vehicular-to-infrastructure communication. The proposed antenna consists of five cross-dipole elements mounted on a cubic metabox (CMB). Each surface of the CMB is a layer of artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) array of  $3\times 3$  unit cells, where each unit cell generates in-phase reflection for the UHF band. The presented AMC-backed antenna element has an impedance bandwidth of  $810-920$  MHz in the UHF band and  $2.35-2.5$  GHz in the WLAN band. The peak gain of the AMC-backed antenna element in the UHF and WLAN bands is 7 and 6.33 dB, respectively. Peak gain enhancements result in a longer reading range but narrow coverage. Therefore, a 3-D arrangement is used to widen the interrogation zone of the reader, resulting in a 360° coverage. The interelement isolation is greater than 15 dB, and the envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) is less than 0.006. The proposed CMSA antenna has a hollow cubic design, allowing it to accommodate the electronic circuitry of the reader. The proposed CMSA antenna could be a suitable candidate for readers used for tagged-vehicle detection due to its high gain, wide reading zone, dual-band coverage, low cost, low interelement coupling, and ease of packaging.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3407659","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550143","Artificial magnetic conductor (AMC);circular polarization;cross-dipole;metasurface;radio frequency identification (RFID);reader","Antennas;Dipole antennas;Antenna arrays;Radiofrequency identification;Metasurfaces;UHF antennas;Substrates","","4","","25","IEEE","5 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is applied exemplary to the analytically known characteristic modes (CMs) of the spherical shell. The eigenvalue behavior of a cube in free space is derived from it numerically. In this process, formerly crossing eigenvalue traces are found to split up, forming a macroscopic crossing avoidance (MACA). This finding is used to explain indentations in eigenvalue traces observed for 3-D structures, which are of increasing interest in recent literature. The utility of this knowledge is exemplified through a demonstrator antenna design. Here, the subduction procedure is used to analytically predict the eigenvalues of a cuboid on a perfectly electrically conducting plane. The a priori knowledge about the MACA is used to avoid its negative impact on input matching and the frequency stability of the far-field patterns, by choosing the dimensions of the antenna structure so the MACA is outside the target frequency range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3407357","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action within the Luftfahrtforschungsprogramm through the Project Master360(grant numbers:20D1905C); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550148","Antenna theory;characteristic modes (CMs);group theory;multiport antennas;symmetry","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Antennas;Subduction;Antenna theory;Method of moments;Microwave antennas;Indexes","","","","42","IEEE","5 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The array consists of three columns with eight in-line slots to narrow the beamwidth in the E-plane and H-plane, thus increasing the gain in the boresight direction. The slots are excited by the longitudinal currents created by a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave, which propagates within the coaxial line placed beneath them. Each column of the array is fed by a coupling slot placed in the center, thus mitigating beam squint over the operating frequency band. The aforementioned coupling slot directly couples the fields from an additional feeding line used for routing. The proposed design consists of six unconnected metal sheets which are stacked together. The use of gap waveguide technology prevents field leakage from any potential air gap among the layers, thus making assembly easier and more tolerant. A prototype with two side-by-side antennas is manufactured using a quick, cost-effective, and suitable for mass production metal sheet process. The measurements agree very well with the simulations within the frequency band of interest from 76 to 81 GHz. The measured return loss is better than 10 dB.

However, antenna co-location introduces significant challenges, primarily in the form of substantial mutual interference among the antennas. In this article, we explore the integration of two cylindrical dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) operating at distinct frequency bands, specifically 3.5–3.9 GHz and 6.0–6.4 GHz, designed for uplink and downlink communication with satellites. These DRAs are nested concentrically, resulting in a dual-band shared-aperture DRA. However, the performance of this configuration is significantly compromised due to the interaction between the two DRAs. To mitigate these interferences, two novel approaches are developed to suppress cross-band scattering and coupling, respectively. As a consequence, radiation patterns are restored and port isolations are improved. Subsequently, a prototype of the dual-band shared-aperture DRA was designed, fabricated, and tested. The measured results validate the effectiveness of these innovative interference mitigation techniques. The developed dual-band shared-aperture DRA represents a promising solution for installation on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to facilitate satellite communication.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3411712","Australian Research Council (ARC) DECRA(grant numbers:DE200101347); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558774","6G;cross-band decoupling;cross-band descattering;dielectric resonator antenna (DRA);dual-band;metasurface;shared-aperture antenna","Metasurfaces;Dielectric resonator antennas;Scattering;Dual band;Mutual coupling;Dielectrics;Antenna radiation patterns","","3","","31","IEEE","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Within the nullspace, the required polarization characteristics can always be guaranteed and the focused polarized pattern synthesis problem can consequently return to a traditional power pattern synthesis problem. Given the convex nature of the problem, it can then be effectively solved through a single execution of the second-order cone program (SOCP), which enables us to obtain optimal low SLLs under the preplaced polarization constraints.

These two components are then appropriately rescaled to cure the solution from a loss of accuracy occurring when the time step is large. Yukawa-type integral operators of a purely imaginary wavenumber are also used as a Calderón preconditioner to eliminate the ill-conditioning of matrix systems. The stabilized time-domain electric and magnetic field integral equations are linearly combined in a Calderón-like fashion, then temporally discretized using an appropriate pair of trial functions, resulting in a marching-on-in-time (MOT) linear system. The novel formulation is immune to spurious resonances, dense discretization breakdown, large-time step breakdown, and dc instabilities stemming from non-trivial kernels.

The MBF formulation bridges the gap between the thin-wire MoM and general conducting surface MoM formulations by introducing circumferential variations and components beyond the standard rooftop basis functions. The MBFs are constructed upon a full-order, divergence-conforming, triangle-element MoM discretization. Comprehensive junction and end-cap treatment and tapered wire support are natural features of the formulation.

Unfortunately, the efficiency of FFT-based acceleration schemes can be dramatically reduced by the presence of multiscale features. Large triangles will impose a relatively coarse mesh, and large regions where FFT must be replaced by integration. Since many small triangles can fall in this region, integration costs will become prohibitive, diminishing the benefits provided by FFT. We propose an efficient and robust algorithm to overcome this barrier, based on multigrid concept. A hierarchy of grids of different resolution is used to simultaneously resolve subwavelength details and propagate fields efficiently across large distances with the FFT. Integration and precorrection costs are minimized by adapting projection stencils to the size of each triangle and enabling the use of the quasi-static Green’s function for short distances. Finally, a clever implementation based on sparse matrices exploits empty areas to reduce computational cost and memory consumption. The method is fully automated, and was tested on several structures including layouts of commercial products. Compared to existing adaptive integral method (AIM) algorithms, we demonstrate a speed-up between 7.1 and  $24.7\times $  and a reduction in memory consumption by up to 2.9 times.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3410541","Advanced Micro Devices; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; CMC Microsystems; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10555541","Boundary element method (BEM);electromagnetic analysis;fast solvers;integral equation method;multigrid;multiscale modeling","Mathematical models;Green's function methods;Fast Fourier transforms;Costs;Antennas and propagation;Integral equations;Surface impedance","","3","","42","IEEE","12 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While abundant propagation knowledge exists for bands below 6 GHz, the same is not true for millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies. In this article, we present the design, implementation, and measurement-based verification of a reconfigurable 27.5–29.5 GHz channel sounder. Based on the switched array principle, our design is capable of characterizing  $128 \times 256$  dynamic double-directional dual-polarized channels with snapshot times of around 600 ms. This is in sharp contrast to measurement times on the order of tens-of-minutes of sounders by rotating horn antennas. The antenna arrays at both link ends are calibrated in an anechoic chamber with high angular sampling intervals of 3° in azimuth and elevation domains, which enables de-embedding the system responses of the sounder from the propagation channels.

However, the nonlinearity and nonstationarity of the M(3000)F2 make its near-real-time forecasting very challenging. This study presents a new hybrid method for improving the near-real-time forecasting accuracy of M(3000)F2 based on deep learning (DL) using improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN), correlation coefficients (CCs), and bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM).

The hybrid model initially employs ICEEMDAN to decompose the M(3000)F2 into subsequences and then uses CC to reconstruct the subsequences into approximate and detailed components. The reconstructed components are forecast with solar activity and geomagnetic activity parameters, and the results are combined and output, achieving a high-precision forecasting of M(3000)F2. For the validation and test sets, the average root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.10 and 0.12, and the relative RMSE (RRMSE) is 3.38% and 4.14%. Multiple comparative experiments are conducted with some mainstream models to validate the forecast accuracy and stability of the model, which outperforms comparative models, especially in low-latitude areas.

The process can be adjusted to various parameters of materials, including those that are intrinsically specular and transparent or are simulated as such, e.g., certain walls and windows. This generates a comprehensive heatmap of the predicted received signal strength indicator (RSSI) level of the radio signal.

It accounts for material properties that affect signal propagation, which are often overlooked by conventional models. Additionally, it exploits advanced graphics domain techniques, balancing accuracy and detail. The efficacy and accuracy of this approach are evaluated for Wi-Fi technology, and this approach is validated against established methods like the empirical multiwall model and the deterministic multiresolution frequency-domain ParFlow (MR-FDPF) method.

We demonstrate a PCB-based electrically tunable resonator (PETR) for enhancing the sensing sensitivity of the Rydberg atomic sensor to VHF band fields. In this approach, the sub-wavelength PETR is made of PCB, which offers improved mechanical strength and miniaturization. During the measurements, a parallel-plate waveguide (PPWG) is utilized as the radio frequency (RF) field launcher to eliminate unintentional scattering from the surroundings. By adjusting the bias voltage applied to the tuning varactor of the PETR, we can continuously tune the resonant frequencies from 187 to 293.6 MHz, corresponding to a relative bandwidth of 44%. There is a fluctuation in the enhancement factor of the PETR, ranging from 17.6 to 60.1, which is primarily caused by misalignment between the laser beam and the resonant area. Furthermore, employing the off-resonant Rydberg atomic heterodyne technique, we investigated the sensitivity of the system. In the absence of the PETR, the sensitivity for an RF signal at 250.5 MHz was found to be  $97.44 ~\mu \text{V}$ /cm $\sqrt {\text {Hz}}$ . However, with the presence of our PETR, the sensitivity significantly improved to  $1.73 ~\mu \text{V}$ /cm $\sqrt {\text {Hz}}$ , indicating a remarkable enhancement capacity of 56.23 times or 35 dB.

Solving EMIS problems is a challenging topic due to various difficulties, such as intrinsic nonlinearity, high computation cost, high contrast, and so on. To overcome these challenges, a novel DL-inspired approach is presented in the context of conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (CDCGAN), termed CDCGAN-EMIS. The proposed CDCGAN is based on a generator with an EM forward solver and the corresponding discriminator, both constructed by deep convolutional neural networks (DConvNets). During the offline training step, the generator learns a distribution between the measured scattered field data and the corresponding contrasts (permittivities) of dielectric scatterers, while the discriminator determines whether the presented samples are real or fake. Therefore, such CDCGAN-EMIS can generate contrasts of scatterers from measured scattered field data, by learning the distribution between the known contrasts of scatterers and their corresponding field and generating solutions. Based on the proposed CDCGAN-EMIS, EMIS problems can be accurately solved even for extremely high-contrast scatterers. Numerical examples indicate the accuracy and feasibility of our method. The proposed CDCGAN-EMIS opens a novel path for the DL-inspired real-time quantitative microwave imaging method for high-contrast scatterers.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3388205","Major Research Project on Scientific Instrument Development, National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42327901); Hong Kong Research Grants Council (HKRGC) General Research Fund (GRF)(grant numbers:17201020,17300021,C7004-21GF,Joint NSFC-RGC N-HKU76921); Fellowship Award from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:HKU PDFS2122-7S05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10559788","Convolutional generative adversarial network;electromagnetic inverse scattering (EMIS);high-contrast scatterer","Electromagnetic interference;Generators;Training;Image reconstruction;Accuracy;Permittivity;Iterative methods","","8","","46","IEEE","17 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the near field reciprocity is derived between incoherent thermal radiation from the calibration target and the coherent radiation from the receiver antenna, based on the fundamental mode property at the antenna port, which is common in real-world applications. Then, the reciprocity-based calculation routine can be established in the near field, including both the antenna and calibration target in the same computation region. The reciprocity-based calculation is then verified and discussed versus direct calculation results, in the cases of homothermic and heterothermic, close/open scenarios.

One of the advantages of the SLM is its speed: in this work, the SLM computes the current flowing on a chaff particle from 2 to 29.5 GHz at least 80 times faster than a method of moments (MoMs) solution. A new spherical chaff cloud shielding model based on the SLM is then presented to rapidly compute the chaff cloud RCS as a function of its density. The results show that shielding, in addition to mutual coupling, is responsible for the nonlinear departure of the cloud’s RCS as a function of its density.

Here, we introduce a generalized framework that capitalizes on the aforementioned concept but enables independent scaling of multiple operating frequencies. The fundamental component of the developed approach is the identification of orthogonal scaling directions affecting individual center frequencies, which is a nontrivial extension of concurrent parameter adjustment. Our technique has been validated using several multiband antennas, all redesigned for operating conditions unreachable using conventional tuning methods.
