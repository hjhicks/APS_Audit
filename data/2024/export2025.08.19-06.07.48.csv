We propose a wideband dual-polarized stub-loaded proximity-coupled stacked patch antenna and vertical power divider as design solutions. Circuit analysis is performed to provide the equivalent circuit model and its design validity. We designed, simulated, and measured a  $4 \times 1$  subarray, which ultimately builds THz  $8 \times 8$  AiP for the next generation 6G communications system. The designed proximity-coupled stacked patch antenna employs open and short stubs in via transition of the antenna’s feeding for bandwidth enhancement. The designed power divider is constructed vertically to minimize the size of the  $4 \times 1$  subarray. This innovative power-splitting architecture significantly decreases the complexity of the feeding network because the divider is designed without conventional T-junctions and quarter wavelength impedance transformers (ITs); thus, the size of the dual-fed dual-polarized  $4 \times 1$  subarray, limited by two four-way power dividers can be shrunken considerably. Based on these proposed techniques, we fabricated and measured an  $8 \times 8$  antenna array package on our custom-built probe station.

First, four subarrays based on cascaded triangular cavities are arranged using a mirror operation to form the mm-wave antenna array. Then, four mm-wave subarrays are connected at the position where the electric field is at a minimum on their edges. Finally, the entire mm-wave array structure resonates in the microwave band, which can be equivalent to a shorted quarter-wavelength patch antenna in the sub-6 GHz band. Hence, the same radiator can work as both a sub-6 GHz antenna and an mm-wave antenna array with broadside patterns in both cases. Attributed to the novel co-radiator structure, the proposed design is simple and compact. An interdigital coupled line with a high-pass filtering characteristic is inserted into each mm-wave feeding line to enhance the isolation.

This article seeks to extend these derivations to elliptical loops as well as demonstrate that elliptical loops, possessing more degrees of freedom than their circular counterparts, afford additional benefits. The asymmetric geometrical parameters of elliptical loops force some modifications to the standard calculational procedure, resulting in a closed-form solution to the fundamental equations and a computationally fast method of solution. Results show a high level of accuracy compared to full-wave solvers and reveal some remarkable features of the elliptical loops. At low frequencies, the admittance plots indicate higher Q values at the resonances for elliptical loops than those of circular loops. The higher Q values correspond to increasing ellipticity. At higher frequencies, loss occurs in metals, with resonance reaching saturation in the infrared as expected with circular loops. Interestingly, it is also shown that elliptical loops can be properly engineered to radiate near-pure multipoles of a given order, further distinguishing their performance from that of circular loops.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3339965","University of Granada (UGR) Visiting Scholar Program and Salvador de Madariaga Program(grant numbers:PRX21/00745); Spanish National Projects(grant numbers:PID2019-106120RB-C33,PID2020-112545RB-C54); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355881","Antenna theory;loop antennas;thin-wire antennas","Wires;Geometry;Mathematical models;Loop antennas;Current distribution;Surface impedance;Impedance","","1","","28","IEEE","12 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The outer stubs at the corresponding positions of inner ones play the role to control the attenuation constant of the antenna. It shows that the proposed structure can realize different attenuation constants with almost the same phase constant values and slopes in the endfire frequency range by just modifying the inner strip and outer stub lengths. The mechanism of the antenna is first discussed to explore its radiation properties under different phase constants. Based on the equivalent circuit model of simplified element, the propagation characteristics are then analyzed to evaluate the effects of different circuit values on the endfire operation point. After that, the propagation constants of designed structure are further discussed under various situations by employing short-open-load (SOL) method in full-wave simulation to discover the realizable attenuation values. Finally, a horizontally polarized prototype with Taylor distribution is designed to achieve −20 dB sidelobe level to verify the effectiveness of the proposed loading strategy on flexible modification of the propagation constants, where the simulated results agree well with the measured ones and the main beams are not disturbed in the endfire frequency range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3346033","National Natural Science Foundation of China under General Program(grant numbers:61971475); Science and Technology Development Fund of Macao under FDCT Research(grant numbers:0080/2021/A2,0085/2020/AMJ); University of Macau(grant numbers:CPG2023-00020-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10376395","Coplanar strip (CPS) line;endfire antenna;leaky wave antenna (LWA);low sidelobe level;traveling wave antenna","Leaky wave antennas;Attenuation;Loading;Microstrip antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Periodic structures;Loaded antennas","","4","","35","IEEE","29 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, the first-, second-, and third-order modes (CM1–CM3) of a dual-port single-slot antenna with co-polarized pattern are theoretically studied by using a characteristic mode analysis (CMA). The results demonstrate that when one port is excited, the electric-field null of the antenna could be shifted to another unexcited port by combining these three modes, thus reducing the MC between two ports under a co- polarized pattern. Then, the short-ended bridges are loaded across the slot, resulting to move resonant frequencies of its CM1–CM3 closely to each other. After that, the microstrip lines are selected to excite the slot antenna for wide impedance matching. In addition, the linear slot is bent in order to reduce the electrical length. With these arrangements, our proposed quad-port cross-slot antenna has gained the desired co- polarized and dual-polarized radiation patterns with low MC. Finally, our designed antenna prototype is fabricated and measured. The results indicate that the isolation bandwidth ( $\vert S_{11}\vert < -10$  dB and MC  $ < -17$  dB) of our designed antenna is successfully extended to about 16.18% ranging from 4.83 to 5.68 GHz, becoming obviously widened compared to the traditional counterpart.

The problem of active element pattern deviation caused by coupling in PRAA has been solved, thereby improving the PRAA’s ability for wide-angle scanning. The pattern reconfigurable antenna (PRA) in the PRAA is composed of a driving dipole antenna with parasitic elements integrated with p-i-n diodes. The comb structures (CSs) are used as parasitic elements of the PRA to achieve self-decoupling in the PRAA. The working mechanism of the CSs is investigated by characteristic mode analysis (CMA) theory. The results indicate that CSs can reduce the coupling between adjacent parasitic elements as well as the coupling between PRAs in the PRAA. Compared to the PRAA composed of traditional parasitic rectangular structures, the proposed PRAA exhibits a maximum reduction of approximately 17.3 dB in sidelobes and a maximum increase of approximately 2.5 dB in gain during beam scanning. A proposed  $1\times4$  PRAA is fabricated and measured. The results confirm that the proposed PRAA can achieve scanning from −60° to 60°, with gain fluctuations less than 2 dB and sidelobes lower than −7.31 dB. Additionally, the proposed PRAA eliminates the degradation of cross-polarization caused by increasing scanning angles. Within the ±60° scanning range, the cross-polarization remains below −28 dB.

To ensure compact size as well as good radiation performance, the excited MPA is designed to operate in the single fundamental TM01 mode. On the other hand, due to the near-field coupling effect, the TM01 mode and the adjacent TM11 mode are simultaneously excited in the coupled MPA. The superposed field of the two coupled modes forms a null-field region at the position of feeding probe, generating an intrinsic coupling dip with low  $\vert \text{S}_{21}\vert $  above the resonance frequency of TM01 mode. To make use of this intrinsic coupling dip, the decoupling band is moved downward to overlap with the impedance passband by simply truncating two rectangular corners from the rectangular MPA. A self-decoupled convex MPA array is thus achieved without requiring any additional decoupling structure. This self-decoupling method is also applicable to the E-plane coupled MPA array, and more importantly, it is extendable to a large-scale planar MIMO array, showing great universality. For validation, a  $2\times2$  MPA array is simulated, fabricated, and measured.

Kernel function for a square loop antenna with arbitrary orientation is derived by using relative coordinates. With the help of a phase-sequence expansion, the coupled integral equations are decomposed into several independent phase sequences so that they can be solved individually with the method of moments (MoM). Computational results show that the mutually perpendicular arms of the loop have different current distributions due to their distinct wavenumbers. Also, current moments on the arms decay with the geomagnetic dip angle while the input impedance increases as the dip angle, operating frequency, or the half-length rises.

It operates at two industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, namely, with a broadside radiation at 2.45 GHz and an omnidirectional radiation pattern at 5.8 GHz. A hybrid substrate based on flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and PF4-foam materials is introduced to overcome the low radiation efficiency in both modes due to the PDMS substrate. The hybrid substrate is realized by replacing the PDMS substrate areas exhibiting high power loss density with a low-loss PF4-foam material. This reduces the dielectric loss and improves the radiation efficiency by an average value of 17% and 20% in the 2.45- and 5.8-GHz ISM bands, respectively. Such a technique extracts the desirable properties of two dielectric materials and combines them to achieve improved antenna performance. The common properties of both materials include high flexibility, resilience, water resistance, and robustness. Importantly, the hybrid substrate offers an optimal trade-off between antenna size and radiation efficiency. In comparison with a PF4-foam-only counterpart, the proposed hybrid substrate demonstrates an antenna area reduction of 19%, while the PDMS-only substrate design exhibits an antenna area reduction of 37%.

Instead of directly optimizing the curves as done in other commercial software packages, the curvature is evaluated and represented using B-spline polynomials. The control points of each spline curve are defined as optimization variables, which generate new curvature profiles at each iteration. The set of curves with the corresponding curvature is synthesized using the natural equation method and is then used to construct the reflector surface. This two-step process of first optimizing the curvature and then reconstructing a reflector surface greatly facilitates the ability to impose constraints on surface curvature arising from the choice of the manufacturing process. Furthermore, no significant degradation in the convergence behavior was observed when including curvature bounds in the cost function. This makes the approach very attractive when compared to existing methods. In addition, this method can be applied to arbitrary reflector configurations of interest and be paired with any optimization method.

This article first proposes antenna pairs consisting of frame monopoles and back cover patches for mobile terminals. Monopole and half-mode patch act as the basic radiating elements, and their operation bandwidths are enhanced by using the electric-/magnetic-coupling (E-/M-coupling).

Both antenna pairs are with wideband performance. Ground booster effect is adopted in the second pair to achieve patch size reduction. Antenna isolation and irrelevance within each pair can be guaranteed attributing to the mode orthogonality of the E-/M-coupling antennas. Two antenna pairs operating at the 5G Wi-Fi band (5.15–5.85 GHz) are designed and the measured results demonstrate the feasibility.

A large number of training data with sufficiently diverse and representative samples (antenna structure parameters, scattering properties, etc.) is mandatory for these methods to ensure good performance. However, traditional antenna modeling methods relying on manual model construction and modification are time-consuming and cannot meet the requirement of efficient training data acquisition. Also, automatic model construction methods are rarely studied. In this article, we pioneer investigation into the antenna model construction problem and first propose a deep-learning-assisted and image-based approach for achieving automatic model construction. Specifically, our method only needs an image of the antenna structure, usually available in scientific publications, as the input while the corresponding modeling codes (visual basic for application (VBA) language) are generated automatically. The proposed model mainly consists of two parts: convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The former is used for capturing features of antenna structure images and the latter is employed to generate the modeling codes. Experimental results show that the proposed method can automatically achieve the antenna parametric model construction with an overhead of approximately 50 s, which is a significant time reduction to manual modeling. The proposed parametric model construction method lays the foundation for further data acquisition, tuning, analysis, and optimization.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3346050","China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10376387","Automatic modeling method;convolutional neural network (CNN)–long short-term memory (LSTM) hybrid network;efficient data acquisition","Antennas;Data models;Codes;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Optimization;Convolutional neural networks","","10","","49","IEEE","29 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design process begins with a preliminary configuration developed from a coupling matrix synthesized in accordance with specified design requirements. Subsequently, a circuit model is established based on this configuration, and the circuit parameters linked to this structure are captured through the use of space mapping technology, emphasizing the applicability of the circuit model. Iterative tuning, involving circuit-based “optimization on the fly,” is employed in the electromagnetic model to achieve better matching performance and desired radiation characteristics. It is remarkable that the duality of the circuit model is utilized in an analytical method for predicting the radiating performance of the patch antenna. This application of the dual circuit models, which embodies significant physical properties, represents a novel approach to antenna analysis. A fourth-order antenna prototype is constructed from a synthesized coupling matrix with a new circuit topology, and a new ring-shaped resonator is applied in that realization.

Typical folded FTAs radiating to the front with two-thirds profile reduction only achieve single polarization due to the polarization-selective property of the employed grid polarizer. This polarizer reflects one polarization and transmits the orthogonal polarization of the incident wave. In this article, we report a novel dual-linearly polarized (DP) FTA by replacing the grid polarizer with a dual-polarization transmissive metasurface. A DP-FTA that radiates to the backside with half profile reduction (DP-FTA_I) is first proposed. A DP, wide beamwidth, short backfire antenna is designed as the source to eliminate the interference between the backside radiation and the measurement accessories such as the transceiver, feeding cable, and connector. The upper reflective perfect electric conductor (PEC) of the DP-FTA_I is replaced with a DP reflective metasurface for phase compensation, leading to a two-thirds profile reduction (DP-FTA_II).

This electrically small antenna (ESA) incorporates a pair of orthogonally arranged crossed electric dipoles and the C-shaped elements serving as the near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) structures and the driven elements. The driven elements are utilized to motivate a 90° phase difference, and then, with almost the same amplitudes and 90° phase difference between the crossed NFRP electric dipoles stimulated by the driven elements, a quasi-isotropic coverage can be realized.

Since the interaction between the platform and the antenna array matters in the simulation results and their meshing produces a large matrix, the analysis of conformal array is computationally expensive. In this article, an efficient method is proposed for the analysis of arbitrary conformal array on cylindrical surface. A periodic Green’s function combined with the method of moments (MoMs) enables efficient analysis with one unit cell. In addition, the Rao–Wilton–Glisson (RWG) basis function is adopted to describe the surface current of arbitrarily shaped array element. Cylindrical periodic Green’s function (CPGF) is calculated by Wynn’s  $\varepsilon $ -algorithm to improve the convergence, and a modified sampling procedure is developed for the RWG basis and weighted functions in the MoM. Key metrics of conformal array, such as the reflection coefficient, mutual coupling, and radiation pattern, are efficiently evaluated by the proposed method. The influences of conformal curvature and element interval are studied, indicating that the interval is a more important factor affecting the near-field characteristics. This method and conclusions can assist the design of various cylindrical conformal arrays.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3348877","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2141230,61971018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10387164","Conformal array;cylindrical surface;periodic Green’s function;Rao–Wilton–Glisson (RWG) basis function","Green's function methods;Method of moments;Antenna arrays;Convergence;Surface impedance;Impedance;Geometry","","3","","59","IEEE","9 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Herein, we bridge this gap and present a comprehensive semianalytical design method for dual-polarized MGs with a separable response for TE and TM waves. First, by relating a printed circuit board (PCB)-compatible array of dog-bone elements with the canonical dipole line analytical model, we establish an MA for TM-polarized MGs, featuring negligible interaction with TE waves. Subsequently, we integrate the proposed configuration with a systematic synthesis scheme to implement a TM beam splitter MG, harnessing the equivalent dipole line model to resolve analytically the optimal MA coordinates and dog-bone polarizability, without resorting to full-wave optimization. Finally, we show that a dual-polarized MG beam splitter can be conveniently synthesized correspondingly, combining the TM-polarized structure as is with previously reported TE-polarized MG designs. This work paves a clear path toward the integration of sparse, semianlaytically synthesized, efficient MGs in practical dual-polarized communication and imaging applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3340013","Israel Science Foundation(grant numbers:1540/18); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355885","Beam splitter;dipole line;dual-polarization;metagrating","Analytical models;Metasurfaces;Optimization;Surface impedance;Standards;Microwave frequencies;Microscopy","","4","","77","IEEE","12 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the contrary, true-time-delay (TTD) planar lenses, which do not resort to phase discontinuities, can achieve large bandwidths. One convenient way to design wideband TTD lenses is by means of ADLs, which are stacks of subwavelength-period patch arrays embedded in a host medium to increase its effective permittivity. Tradeoffs including bandwidth, focal ratio, lens diameter, and thickness are discussed and related to the manufacturing constraints of artificial dielectrics, such as the smallest features realizable in printed circuit board (PCB) technology, which define the maximum achievable effective permittivity.

In the model, the  $y$ -directed periodicity is assumed to be smaller than the wavelength, and the height between two parallel plates is smaller than the half-wavelength. If so, for the periodic metallic nails in the  $yo\textit {z}$  plane, the zero-order Floquer’s mode as a free wave exists in the structure, and the high-order modes as surface waves are tightly bound to the metallic nails. Thereby, the waveguide can be regarded as an  $x$ -direction transmission line alternately loaded by two types of periodic parallel impedances. Further, the dispersion equation is established to determine the passband and forbidden band through the imaginary part of the propagation constant. Especially if two kinds of parallel impedances are equal, the proposed theory can boil down to the existing dispersion model. Finally, based on the sinusoidal current distribution and the equivalent cross section assumptions, the calculus of variations is adopted to solve the analytical expression of the parallel impedance for the cylinder or rectangular nails. The simulations support the proposed theory, regardless of the periodic metallic rectangular and cylinder nails.

AEPs of all the array elements sequentially based on their corresponding subarray features. Subsequently, the co- polarization (CoP) pattern, cross-polarization (XP) pattern, and axial ratio (AR) of the CP array are computed accordingly. In this manner, the MLSM enables the fast performance prediction of arrays with arbitrary geometries and adds an extra degree of freedom (DoF), namely element position, to CP antenna array design. The trained MLSM is also employed to predict the performances of arrays with any given element numbers exploiting the ideology of heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, the MLSM is employed to predict the performance of arrays in several CP array syntheses. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MLSM is a feasible and efficient method for the fast prediction of CP arrays with arbitrary geometries and any given element numbers.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3335808","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62031010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10336744","Circularly polarized (CP) antenna array;cross-polarization (XP) level;deep neural network (DNN);machine-learning (ML);shaped pattern synthesis;transfer learning;vectorial active element pattern (Vec AEP)","Antenna arrays;Mutual coupling;Geometry;Dipole antennas;Transfer learning;Radar antennas;Polarization","","9","","44","IEEE","30 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to the traditional PUMA designs that use closely spaced probes feeding, the proposed design employs tapered probes with larger separation for feeding the array. This architecture enables the antenna to retain the desirable characteristics of unbalanced feeding, ease of manufacturing, and straightforward assembly while avoiding the introduction of additional shorting pins or “cable organizers” and complex external matching networks typically required to eliminate common-mode resonances and achieve wideband performance. Additionally, the use of tapered probes not only eliminates the requirement for any substrate material between the antenna and the ground plane but also inherently contributes to enhancing the polarization isolation. The wide-angle impedance matching layer is implemented using advanced 3-D printing technology, which minimizes the need for multiple substrate layers and adhesive processes and contributes to cost reduction. As an evaluation, an array is meticulously designed to operate across a wide bandwidth of 6.1:1 (0.52–3.19 GHz) with an active VSWR < 3 while scanning within a range of ±45° in all planes. The polarization isolation surpasses 15 dB throughout the majority of the bandwidth when undergoing ±45° scans in the E- and H-planes. An  $8\times8$  prototype array consisting of 128 ports, with 64 elements per polarization, is manufactured and assessed. The experimental findings validate the design as the measured data closely align with the simulated results.

The CPDD method is a double-loop iterative algorithm. It uses a virtual star-shaped topology graph network. The central node of the network corresponds to the global variable, i.e., the common array structure, while each of the edge nodes corresponds to a single-beam synthesis task. In the outer loop, the algorithm collects excitation vector information from the edge nodes through the center node and then integrates the information to obtain a better common array structure. In the inner loop, each beam is synthesized locally in the corresponding edge node based on the information provided by the central node. Finally, all the edge nodes achieve a consistent array structure. Some numerical simulations were performed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in different situations.

This article proposes a near-field Euler rotation-based technique to transform the far-field calculation of arbitrary conformal arrays into the pattern-multiplication form. Specifically, this technique involves rotating and transforming the electric and magnetic field vectors, along with the position vectors on the near-field sampling surface in the local coordinate system (LCS), to a unified sampling surface encompassing all elements in the global coordinate system (GCS). Based on the Schelkunoff’s equivalence principle, the equivalent electric and magnetic currents, which are referred to as equivalent sources, are determined. Consequently, the far fields of the conformal array can be regarded as equivalent to those of arrays composed of these equivalent sources, with the radiation fields of each equivalent-source array conforming to the pattern-multiplication form. Furthermore, the equivalent-source arrays are transformed into 3-D uniform arrays through a virtual expansion operation. To expedite the far-field calculation, the technique incorporates the layer-wise 2-D fast Fourier transform (2D FFT) technique. This is achieved by analyzing the relationship between the array factor of these 3-D arrays and the layer-wise 2D FFT. Finally, several numerical examples, which involve cylindrical and hemispherical–conical arrays and take the mutual coupling (MC) effects into consideration, are provided to validate the advantages of the proposed technique in terms of calculation efficiency and accuracy.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3341217","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271416); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2022NSFSC0494); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10362973","Conformal array;fast Fourier transform (FFT);near-field Euler rotation;principle of pattern multiplication","Surface treatment;Arrays;Transforms;Fast Fourier transforms;Two dimensional displays;Surface waves;Spatial databases","","9","","40","IEEE","15 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The efficiency of ULF signal generation using magneto-mechanical transmitters (MMTs) is dictated by multiphysical effects from mechanical, magnetic, and electrical domains, leading to an interesting trade space. In this work, we show that an MMT’s most power-efficient and most voltage-efficient driving frequencies always differ, forcing designers to sacrifice one efficiency for the other. To address this issue, we propose an efficiency optimization method that minimizes the total impedance of the MMT at the most power-efficient driving frequency, by means of a compensation capacitor added to the electromagnetic actuation coil system. Our experimental results show excellent agreement with our analytical model, and we demonstrate that our approach enables simultaneous maximization of voltage and power efficiencies of an MMT at the same driving frequency. We additionally describe how to apply this optimization method on multiresonator magneto-mechanical arrays and present numerical analysis that predicts much greater improvement factors in systems having larger net magnetic moments and drive coils with larger sizes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3333956","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) through the A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA) Program(grant numbers:HR0011-17-2-0057); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10328552","Magneto-mechanical systems;ultralow frequency (ULF) transmitters;wireless communication","Magnetomechanical effects;Magnetic fields;Magnetic resonance;Voltage;Rotors;Capacitors;Magnetic domains","","","","16","CCBY","23 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, an advanced forward two-sided asymmetric correction method (FTACM) has been proposed. Unlike the traditional inverse asymmetric calibration method (IACM), it needs two independent electromagnetic excitations created by the calibrator; the solution process of the FTACM is forward and independent of the calibration process. The FTACM only needs the self-parameter of the ATPS, including the  $S$ -parameter of the symmetric two-port probe and the  $S$ -parameter of two asymmetric elements. Compared with the IACM, the FTACM has the advantages of no complex mechanical movement (CMM), no symmetry requirement on a calibrator, easy to ultrawideband measurement, greater noise adaptability, and extensible to multiport probing system. A typical calibration result in Case 1 shows that the FTACM can effectively eliminate calibration ripple. The evaluation results of uncertainty prove the reliability of the FTACM, and its maximum uncertainty in Case 2 is 0.12 dB and 1.32° at 18 GHz. The influence and effectiveness of the FTACM on near-field measurement are also analyzed, which shows that the FTACM can correct for asymmetry up to 20 GHz and achieve almost the same characteristics as the original symmetric system.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3348600","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62001123); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022A1515012409); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10382966","Asymmetry correction;calibration;electromagnetic near-field probe;near-field measurement","Probes;Calibration;Voltage measurement;Electromagnetics;Reliability;Noise measurement;Frequency measurement","","5","","37","IEEE","8 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, the exact critical coupling coefficient of the HWPT structure is obtained from the ridge equation of the analytical efficiency expression. It is found to approximate 1/ $Q$  ( $Q$  is the loaded quality factor of the resonators), which shows a similar property with the conventional inductively coupled WPT (IPT) system. In order to improve the efficiency after the critical coupling distance, the magnetic coupling only or the in-phase structures are proposed and realized by rotating the transmitter and adjusting the values of the electric coupling. In addition, for the applications requiring high efficiency over a long transfer distance, a design procedure of the resonator is given with the help of the analytical relationships between the electric parameters and geometrical parameters of the coupling structures. The electromagnetic simulations (ANSYS HFSS) and experiments show good agreement with the theory. The efficiency can hold above 70% within 40–260-mm transfer distance.

While typically found in array type of structures, recent efforts have demonstrated versions of such states in cavity slabs formed by surface impedance sheets. However, such slab configurations are not suitable for free-space excitations due to large sizes of the underlying impedance surfaces (ISs). To alleviate these issues, the present work introduces an open cavity made of a single cylindrical IS for extreme field localizations. The overall structure behaves as a quasi-open cavity, enabled by overlapping resonances in the cavity and the ISs, effectively forming a quasi bound state in the continuum. A cavity formed of conductive strips of Jerusalem crosses is designed in the microwave part of the spectrum and analyzed by analytical and numerical means. The analytical solution, which assumes a homogeneous IS, predicts a quality factor ( $Q$ -factors) of  $\sim 7\times 10^{10}$ , whereas the numerical  $Q$ -factor is 3000 due to material losses and inhomogeneity of the modeled IS fully accounted for in the numerical model.

In this article, the “window-shaped” Sinc function (Sinc-FDA) is innovatively exploited into the frequency offset form to decouple the beampattern rather than using traditional window functions. Moreover, the sidelobe performance of existing window-based FDAs degrades in higher frequency offset bandwidth and wider observation area and is limited by the sidelobes near the main lobe. A weighted function is introduced to further flexibly suppress sidelobes, which forms a new weighted Sinc-FDA (W-Sinc-FDA).

This article presents a comprehensive finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) implementation of Maxwell-hydrodynamic model with the GNOR term to model the interaction between electromagnetic wave and plasmonic nanoantennas of critical size. Due to the necessity of resolving nonlocal effects with deep subnanometer grid sizes, a subgridding technique becomes crucial for achieving convergence. To this end, a novel heterogeneous CPU–GPU technique is developed to further enhance simulation efficiency. The algorithms are validated on small spherical metallic particles, revealing that the nonlocality effectively eliminates staircasing artifacts at curved interfaces, leading to a higher degree of accuracy compared with local models. In addition, numerical results demonstrate the extended capability of the FDTD method to accurately and efficiently model the blueshift and resonant mode broadening observed in both single nanoantennas and nanodimers.

The local adaptation, which is allowed by the inherently matched nature of the generalized Yee cell to the conventional Yee cell, extends the range of applicability of the scheme in Deck-Léger et al., 2023 to moving structures that involve multiple and arbitrary velocity profiles while being fully compatible with the conventional absorbing boundary conditions and standard treatments of medium dispersion. We show that a direct application of the conventional FDTD scheme predicts qualitatively correct spectral transitions but quantitatively erroneous scattering amplitudes, we infer from this observation generalized, hybrid—physical and auxiliary (nonphysical)—fields that automatically satisfy moving boundary conditions in the laboratory frame, and accordingly establish local update equations based on the related Maxwell’s equations and constitutive relationships. We subsequently provide a detailed stability analysis with a generalization of the Courant criterion for the generalized scheme.

This study presents a differentiable physical optics method with signed distance field (DPO-SDF) for 3-D reconstruction of perfect electric conductors (PECs) from scattered electric fields. The DPO-SDF comprises two key components: the model representation part, which uses a signed distance field (SDF) as the continuous geometric representation of the reconstructed model, and the electromagnetic (EM) computation part, which integrates the principles of the physical optics method (PO) to compute the EM fields. Our algorithm takes the configuration of the incident wave as input and outputs the corresponding scattered field, and then optimizes the SDF by minimizing the residual between the output and the measured scattered field. Additionally, two optimization strategies are introduced to enhance the performance of the DPO-SDF. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach is highly effective for 3-D reconstruction tasks. Furthermore, by leveraging physical knowledge, the DPO-SDF achieves high accuracy with low computational cost.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3341502","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFC2201302); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10364728","3-D reconstruction;deep learning;differentiable physical optics method (DPO);inverse scattering problems (ISPs);perfect electric conductors (PECs)","Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Physical optics;Inverse problems;Shape;Optical surface waves;Electric fields","","3","","52","IEEE","18 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents a novel method used to derive cloud attenuation in the absence of rain from Q-band excess attenuation measurements collected at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, taking advantage of ancillary data from two co-located instruments: a disdrometer and a Ka-band beacon receiver. Using this procedure, the time series of Q-band cloud attenuation has been extracted for a period of five years, and the calculated statistical results have been compared to estimations derived from different models. Cloud attenuation statistics derived from measurements with this novel procedure are in good agreement with radiosounding-based models, whereas Rec. ITU-R P.840 model overestimates them.

When dealing with either slowly convergent problems or problems with multiple right-hand side excitations, a system matrix in the format of hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank (HODLR) is chosen, from which a fast matrix inverse can readily be computed. However, directly applying traditional HODLR for PLM cases suffers from fairly low compression rate, especially when large matrix blocks at coarse levels or objects straddling different layers are encountered. Consequently, a modified HODLR (MHODLR) structure involving reconstruction and recompression is further investigated, where key parameters are carefully studied in the context of PLM.

Channel characteristics such as large-scale path loss, time dispersion, coherence bandwidth and sum-rate capacity are reported and evaluated. The results indicate that multislope path loss model is better suited for precise prediction of path loss across various propagation segments within the mining gallery.

Furthermore, combined with ray tracing, the computed scattered fields can be used to model wave propagation in realistic, multipath radio environments with RISs.

To address these challenges, we present a Born Fourier neural operator (B-FNO) to solve generalized Poisson’s equation. First, we utilize the Born approximation method to rapidly compute a rough solver. Second, we construct a Fourier neural operator (FNO) that approximates the mapping between the input Born approximation solver and the true solution, achieved by leveraging a residual learning structure. Importantly, we introduce conformal mapping tools to learning-based methods, allowing the trained B-FNO to be transferred across solving PDEs defined in different regions without requiring re-training. Extensive numerical examples based on benchmark datasets demonstrate that B-FNO learning scheme is effective in reducing the size of the training dataset and enhancing the generalizability to unseen scenarios compared to traditional methods.

However, RTI is formulated on empirical models using an assumption of light-of-sight (LOS) propagation that does not account for intricate scattering effects. There are two main objectives of this work. The first objective is to reconcile and compare the empirical RTI model with formal inverse scattering approaches to better understand why RTI is an effective RF imaging technique. The second objective is to obtain straightforward enhancements to RTI, based on inverse scattering, to enhance its performance. The resulting enhancements can provide reconstructions of the shape and also material properties of the objects that can aid image classification.

In this study, an efficient SA-ISAR imaging framework of maneuvering targets is proposed, which decomposes the multifactorial imaging problem into easy-solving subproblems. A fast phase compensation method that is a combination of modified eigenvector method and interpolation-based compensation matrix is proposed to efficiently remove the translational phase error and the nonuniform rotation-induced phase error.

A theoretical analysis that links the electric fields ( $E$ -fields) of the MIMO antenna with MIMO-SAR is proposed. The mode cancellation method (MCM) is applied to decouple the shared-aperture MIMO antenna and reduce the design complexity of MIMO-SAR reduction based on theoretical guidance. The collaborative reduction of MIMO-SAR and the mutual coupling of the MIMO antenna are achieved for the first time. To achieve MIMO-SAR reduction, the cancellation of the total current equalization (TCE) generated by the predicted total current mode was verified through a theoretical analysis. As a result, an impressive reduction of 82% in MIMO-SAR and an isolation of 20 dB of the MIMO antenna were achieved with a distance of only  $0.047~\lambda $  between the two ports in antenna pair C. An eight-antenna MIMO array was manufactured to validate the simulation, for which the measured −6 dB impedance bandwidth ranges between 3.4–3.6 GHz, and the isolation is better than 16.7 dB.

The antenna provides continuous adjustment of the orientation of linear polarization (LP) over a range of 180°, making it suitable for applications such as identifying objects with diverse orientations in sensing and detection systems. We introduce a general model of an LP antenna, in which the orientation of polarization can be controlled with an adjustable phase shift. By substituting the phase shift in the model with one that is frequency dependent, a 180° LP rotation can be attained by sweeping the source frequency across a custom-designed bandwidth. This allows the implementation of an antenna system that can continuously adjust the orientation of LP in response to frequency scanning over a wide operating bandwidth. As demonstrated in a prototype, a 180° polarization scan with a realized gain varying between 7.0 and 9.8 dBi is achieved by sweeping the frequency from 9.6 to 11.65 GHz.

Thanks to the filtering functionality of the element, two non-phase-shifting areas with sharp roll-off are produced at lower and higher passband edges, meanwhile, the phase delay performs properly in the targeted band.

The structure can estimate LC permittivity across a broadband range by utilizing multiresonant characteristics. Moreover, we propose a procedure using an averaged inhomogeneous model, thereby enabling accurate calculation of LC permittivity.

However, they suffer from reflection and scattering losses at sharp routes or defects. The breakthrough in developing topological photonic crystals (PhCs) provides promising solutions to robust signal transmission. In this work, we propose a new mechanism for protecting wave-guiding modes by decorating the boundaries of a conventional waveguide with valley-Hall PhCs. This special layout enables the robust propagation of conventional transverse electric (TE) waves against defects and bends. Moreover, the proposed waveguide is compatible with the substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW). High-efficient mode conversion from the SIW to the proposed waveguide is achievable. By leveraging the idea of topology to conventional waveguides, we provide a powerful and practical tool that can largely improve the performance of microwave and millimeter-wave integrated circuits while reserving the features of wave-guiding modes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3336978","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62301470); Hong Kong Polytechnic University Startup fund for RAPs(grant numbers:BD2P); Young Scientist Fund(grant numbers:NSFC11804087); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:NSFC12247101); Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2022CFB553); Key Research and Development Proram of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2023BAB061); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341331","Millimeter-wave (mmWave) integrated waveguides;robust wave propagation;topological waveguides;valley photonic crystals (PhCs)","Electromagnetic waveguides;Photonic band gap;Lattices;Dispersion;Topology;Substrates;Millimeter wave communication","","10","","41","IEEE","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
