The antenna element is specified according to the four distinct derivation processes. The port isolation is enhanced by using an indirect feeding mechanism through slot aperture coupling integrated with substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) feed. Based on the antenna array theory, the extended array structure ensures optimized interantenna spacings. The reflection coefficient of the antenna element satisfies below −10 dB for both operating bands. In addition, interport isolation surpasses 30 dB in Ku-band and 20 dB in Ka-band. For the demonstration of beam-steering capabilities, distinct array structures are devised and constructed for each band. Both simulations and measurements for the Ku-band feature a beam-steering angle exceeding ±40° for both polarizations, with a peak gain of 10.3 dBi based on a  $1\times3$  array antenna structure. In the case of the Ka-band, measurements and simulations consistently demonstrate a beam-steering angle of no less than ±43° across both polarizations.

Numerous flat-topped antennas have been proposed, but the existing ones usually have complex feeding networks, bulky sizes, or high profiles. To solve these problems, a compact singly-fed flat-topped dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) is proposed in this article. Based on the principle of pattern superposition, the lower order DRA mode (TE $^{\text {y}}_{311}$  mode) and the fundamental slot mode are excited simultaneously to obtain flat-top patterns in both the E- and H-planes. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first time that lower order DRA modes can be utilized to achieve flat-top radiation patterns. Two higher permittivity dielectric slabs are attached to the DRA to move these two modes together, and a metallic wall is added to reduce SLLs. For verification, a prototype operating at 5.8 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured radiation patterns are flat-topped in both the E- and H-planes with flat-top beamwidths of 50° and SLLs lower than −17 dB. The flat-top patterns can be maintained from 5.74 to 5.86 GHz with an average gain of 8.2 dBi.

A family of curved ray paths are traced starting from a set of points defined on the lens input interface, which is illuminated by a feed antenna, up to a corresponding set of points on the output interface, i.e., the lens radiating aperture. The ray tracing is numerically performed in combination with the field transportation along the ray by exploiting an additional wavefront-curvature transport equation, thus providing a single independent vector ordinary differential equation (ODE) for each ray. This scheme allows a complete parallelization of the algorithm by assigning any ray to a different thread. Crossing the lens input–output interfaces at the two end points of the curved ray is accomplished by augmenting the refraction Snell’s law and the Fresnel transmission coefficients with a novel compact closed-form dyadic formula for the transmitted wavefront curvature. The ODE output provides the field aperture distribution on the output lens interface, permitting the far-field calculation as a radiation integral. To this end, an ad hoc quadrature rule is exploited, which requires an aperture sampling rate corresponding to the slowly varying part of the integrand, while the rapid phase variation is accounted for analytically, thus resulting in an extremely efficient and frequency-independent scheme. The effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm are shown by resorting to a couple of well-known analytical benchmarks and to two more general examples with real-life antennas: a spaceborne weather radar lens antenna and a feed antenna with a zero-focal lens.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3360727","Huawei Technologies Company Ltd. through the joint Innovation Antenna Laboratory between Huawei; Department of Information Engineering and Mathematics, University of Siena; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10423591","Dielectric lenses;geometrical optics (GO);inhomogeneous lenses;inhomogeneous media;lens antennas;ray tracing","Lenses;Ray tracing;Nonhomogeneous media;Mathematical models;Trajectory;Refractive index;Apertures","","6","","37","CCBY","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, conventional OAM beams suffer from the limitations of beam divergence and stringent alignment requirements in practical wireless communications. To cope with the challenge, we propose a broadband Huygens’ transmissive metasurface for the manipulation of non-diffractive OAM beams operating at 0.1 THz, which has the advantages of low profile, simplicity, and ease of fabrication. By virtue of its flexible phase control capability, the metasurface using a combination of hyperbolic phase, OAM phase, and axicon phase is proposed to multiplex two high-order Bessel beams. Both simulation and measurement results indicate that it generates non-diffractive OAM beams with high purity over a broad bandwidth of 20 GHz. Based on the metasurface, a 112-Gbit/s photonic THz wireless communication link using two non-diffractive OAM beams, with each channel carrying a 14-Gbaud 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal, is experimentally demonstrated for the first time. The communication performance of high-order Bessel beams is compared with the conventional OAM beams, and it is found that these high-order Bessel beams are more preferable to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) owing to the more stable field distribution. This work provides an effective way to alleviate the diffractive divergence of the OAM waves and extend the achievable link distance in wireless THz OAM communication systems, opening new opportunities for high data rate wireless communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3362374","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1805700); Natural National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171409,62101483); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LQ21F010015,LY23F010006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10433167","Bessel beam;metasurface;non-diffractive beam;orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing;terahertz (THz) photonics;THz wireless communication","Metasurfaces;Multiplexing;Wireless communication;Lenses;Apertures;Broadband communication;Broadband antennas","","11","","50","IEEE","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Owing to the 1-bit amplitude modulation, the period length of the LWA is dynamically switched and multiple space harmonic modes are selectively radiated. The tilted angle of the main lobe is determined by the frequency (frequency scanning), and the beam shape is controlled by the amplitude distribution. In this way, based on the digital leaky wave elements, the functionality of space (pattern) and frequency diversity is realized by coding 0/1 digital sequences. More importantly, the polarization modulation is obtained by exploring the switchable polarizer. Then, a space, frequency, and polarization diversity digital LWA is realized. For validation, an amplitude and frequency modulation metasurface-based LWA is fabricated. By selecting different digital signals, various radiation beams are modulated.

The antenna is specifically developed to achieve deep penetration and enhance detection accuracy. The design process involves placing two bowtie radiating elements orthogonally to generate vertical and horizontal polarization. Half-wavelength curved slots etched at the radiating elements create additional resonant frequencies and expand the operating bandwidth. A square cavity is used to back the antenna, ensuring unidirectional wave propagation and impedance matching for low-order modes. Via-fencing of the radiator is employed to confine surface currents, resulting in improved isolation (better than 20 dB) and electromagnetic wave penetration (more than 20% improvement at different frequencies). The antenna covers the frequency range of 0.17–1.74 GHz (164% fractional bandwidth). Despite its compact size ( $0.05\times 0.05\times 0.03\,\,\lambda ^{3}$ , where  $\lambda $  represents the wavelength at the lowest operating frequency), the antenna demonstrates enhanced wave penetration into the human torso by 172% and 62% compared to recent gradient index lens antennas and tapered gradient-index lens antennas, respectively. Notably, this improvement is achieved with much lower complexity and reduction in weight. The imaging capability of the antenna is assessed using a realistic average-male torso phantom and an optimized-based confocal imaging algorithm. The results reveal a significant enhancement of at least 35% in the signal-to-mean-clutter ratio (SMCR) when a dual-polarized antenna is employed.

The radiating section of the antenna is immersed inside a medium with a relative permittivity of  $\epsilon _{r}= 40$  and a conductivity of 0.55 S/m to improve the matching between the antenna and the brain tissues.

The proposed self-quadruplexing antenna operates at 168 MHz [industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band], 433 MHz (ISM band), 915 MHz (ISM band), and 1400 MHz [wireless medical telemetry service (WMTS) band] when Ports 1, 2, 3, and 4 are activated, respectively. The proposed antenna is simulated inside a rectangular device in the head of a human phantom. The suggested antenna comprises four individually excited semicircular meandered resonators with a common ground plane. The compactness of the design is achieved using a high dielectric substrate and using semicircular meandered resonators. The meandered resonators enlarge the current path, resulting in significant miniaturization. As a result, the proposed antenna consumes a small volume of  $12\,\, \times 14.5 \times 0.13 = 22.62$  mm3. The coupling among all ports is also minimized using an ultrathin substrate. Consequently, the mutual coupling between any two ports is less than −21.8 dB. It provides a peak gain of −36.24, −34.78, −31.39, and −30.10 dBi at 168, 433, 915, and 1400 MHz, respectively.

This radiator element can directly realize four switchable radiation phase states without extra phase-shifting circuits. By introducing the higher order mode characteristics, these array elements are fed by a single-port cavity rather than the conventional multiport feeding networks. Thus, this design is very different from traditional phased arrays and bit arrays. More importantly, the 1-bit amplitude switching function is cleverly introduced by controlling the field distribution of this radiator, which can further manipulate the beam shape. To validate the proposed working principles, a phase and amplitude digitally reconfigurable substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) antenna is fabricated and measured.

To obtain superior antenna performance, three effective measures have been taken. First, the shorted patches that function as ME dipoles are connected through a crossed strip and fed by a pair of orthogonal H-shaped coupling slots, generating four resonant modes in the passband and hence effectively widening the impedance bandwidth. Second, a grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW)-based crossover is utilized, ensuring consistent performance of two orthogonal polarizations while providing high isolation and symmetric radiation pattern. Third, four parasitic L-shaped patches and an X-shaped reflector are introduced, stabilizing the gain across the operating band. As a result, a broad −10-dB impedance bandwidth of 50.6% ( $23.3-39.1$  GHz), a high isolation level of over 32 dB, and a flat gain of  $7.35-9.45$  dBi (H-polarization)/ $7.45-9.65$  dBi (V-polarization) are simultaneously achieved. Furthermore, using this antenna element, a  $2\times2$  dual-polarized array is developed. In order to compensate the gain loss caused by large ground plane, metallic cavity and defected ground surface (DGS) are adopted. The measured results show that this array has a high isolation of over 29 dB and a peak gain up to 15.9 dBi in a wide bandwidth of 53.3% ( $22-38$  GHz).

In this way, the millimeter-wave phased array has switchable radiation pattern and a beam-scanning angle of ±55° and ±65° in the broadside and endfire directions, respectively. Compared with the previous works, the proposed array has a wider operating bandwidth of 24–28 GHz with competitively large scanning angle and high gain.

However, there are still issues regarding its out-of-band reflection at the port, which may cause internal interference or affect system stability. To solve these problems, an absorptive FA (AFA) with both frequency selectivity and wideband matching is presented in this article. The antenna is designed by coupling an absorptive resonator to a common resonant antenna. On the basis of a microstrip-fed slot antenna, the proposed prototype is obtained by employing the short-circuited quarter-wavelength line as the microwave resonator and the quarter-wavelength sectional line as the admittance inverter. The performances are exhaustively analyzed with the equivalent circuit. Finally, a practical design with the microstrip line (MSL) structure is implemented for experimental verification. The circuit calculation, electromagnetic simulation, and measurement lead to consistent results, showing a flat gain within 1.88–2.13 GHz and a wide matching band over 1.22–2.92 GHz. The results reveal that the proposed antenna has attained a superior matching bandwidth compared to other absorptive antennas.

The active voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) for the infinite array is lower than 3.2 at broadside. It remains lower than 2.9, 3.3, and 4.3 when scanning to 60° in E-plane, D-plane, and H-plane, respectively.

Then, the shorted posts are added to mitigate the non-radiating common mode, which also introduces the radiating loop mode into the proposed antenna. However, the central resonant frequency of the loop mode is far from the operating frequency bands. To address this issue, the cavity-backed overlapping pad is designed to change the loop path. By adjusting the position of the shorted posts, the central resonant frequency of this loop mode is moved to around 2 GHz. Moreover, to lower the active VSWR when scanning and then improve the radiation efficiency, the wide-scanning impedance matching FSS and the double-layer RFSS with the modified structures are employed.

The TCMPA is a configuration consisting of a top-loaded short vertical monopole within a printed circuit board (PCB) stack between two ground planes. When appropriately designed, it exhibits a wideband characteristic by exploiting the operation principle of the tightly coupled dipole array (TCDA), which is well-suited for thin aperture-sized fifth-generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) antennas. In addition, the MS-based radiating structure was investigated through a dispersion diagram, which is imperative for impedance matching to the thin TCMPA in a PCB stack. A wideband operation of the TCMPA with the MS was demonstrated. A significant advantage of this is that the wideband operation of a very thin endfire antenna can be achieved using only a PCB: it was shown that the thickness of the proposed array is  $0.06\lambda $  low at the lowest operating frequency. The impedance matching bandwidth of  $1\times4$  array is 22.5–42.1 GHz (60.7%) for uniform excitation and 24.3–42.1 GHz (53.6%) for a scan angle of 45°.

In response, this article introduces a tiling method for sub-arrayed SCPAAs, guided by a maximum 3-D space entropy model (M3D-SEM). By introducing the concept of 3-D space entropy for SCPAAs, the tiling problem can be transformed into a subarray partition for the full array, avoiding the issue of changeable radiation aperture of SCPAAs at different scanning angles. Then, the tiling topology formed by two-element tiles for sub-arrayed SCPAAs is binary coded and optimized by convex integer optimization programming based on M3D-SEM. The desired polarized array pattern synthesis is further finished by the convex optimization based on the optimized tiling layout for a sub-arrayed SCPAA. Two numerical examples with real simulated element patterns are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested method. The results indicate that within the hemispherical beam coverage, the optimized sub-arrayed SCPAA with half of its transmit/receive (T/R) channels reduced, exhibits directivities only 1.1–1.9 dB lower compared with the original SCPAA.

The passive and lossless metasurface absorbs the incident wave at port 1, converts it nearly perfectly into a surface wave, which transports the energy along an arbitrarily shaped/curved metasurface to port 2, and then reradiates the captured power as a radiated field with control over its amplitude and phase. Since the incident field is seen to disappear at the input port and reappear at a spatially dislocated port as a new formed beam, the space wave can be said to have been seamlessly transported from one point in space to another. The metasurface consists of a single, conformal, spatially variant, impedance sheet supported by a conformal grounded dielectric substrate of the same shape. It is modeled using integral equations. The integral equations are solved using the method of moments (MoM). The impedances of the sheet are optimized using the adjoint variable method to achieve the near perfect wave transportation operation from a passive and lossless metasurface.

However, it is usually solved by the FDTD method via the auxiliary difference equation technique where the quantum pressure correction term is converted into current density or polarization intensity. This method is severely limited, especially when the quantum pressure correction term includes electron–electron exchange energy, correlation energy, and others beyond Thomas–Fermi (TF) energy.

An important aspect of their study is the electromagnetic analysis of wave interactions at the border of the artificial medium (external space) and at the border of two media with different parameters. In this article, we consider 2-D MFR on the base of a metal ribbon grating with an electrically small period placed inside a parallel plate waveguide (PPW). Approximate boundary conditions of anisotropic conductivity are used for the grating modeling. First, the junction of two semi-infinite media is studied. One is a medium with forced refraction, and the second is 2-D medium in the form of a semi-infinite PPW. The boundary problem is analytically solved using the Wiener–Hopf technique, and the solution is presented in the form of a generalized scattering matrix (GSM). Second, the junction of two MFR is analyzed with the GSM method. Finally, we analyze the obtained solutions and derive simple relations for the reflection coefficients of dominant modes in both junctions.

This manuscript aims at establishing an analytically tractable and hence fast way to estimate user body effects on radiations of cellphone antennas at mmW frequencies. Mathematical operators are first defined to represent the user body effects on cellphone antenna radiation where shadowing and backscattering are modeled through knife-edge diffraction (KED) and geometrical optics (GO). Next, the proposed operators are tested for a cellphone antenna array that is held in landscape and portrait modes. Agreement of radiation pattern cuts and spherical coverage statistics is observed between full-wave simulations with complex human body models and our proposed mathematical operators. Finally, compared with full-wave simulations, the proposed model has a clear computational advantage in predicting user body effects on cellphone radiations without the need for a complex human body model, while maintaining a decent level of accuracy.

Building on previous work based on the characterization of the RIS through a surface impedance (or “spatial modulation”) function and a few parameters, in the present article we propose a fully ray-based approach for the computation of the re-radiated field that can be easily embedded in efficient, forward ray tracing (also known as “ray launching”) models.

There are two main challenges: first, robust techniques to extract resonance features, and second, a synthesis of discriminant signals to achieve automatic quantitative object discrimination. In literature, various time-domain-based techniques are explored, where the discriminant signals are synthesized to make the late-time energy zero, once the target response is convolved with the true pulse from the waveform library. This approach is required to have an accurate estimation of a late-time index, along with its main focus on annihilating resonance information. However, to achieve accurate object recognition, there is a need to have a nonzero or maximum response other than true discriminant pulses. Thus, to fulfill the two critical tasks, natural resonance annihilation and getting a nonzero response for nonresonant components, we proposed the synthesis of frequency-domain-modified notch-filter discriminant waveforms known as N-pulses. Moreover, we proposed the statistical quantitative discrimination measure of the kernel peak-density discrimination number (KDN). This article investigates N-pulses by considering the effect of polarization variations along with parametric analysis.

In this article, we establish a framework to evaluate and optimize the wireless friendliness of a sandwich building material. First, we derive and analyze the equivalent reflection coefficient of a sandwich building material. Then, based on a multipath channel model incorporating the line-of-sight (LOS) path and the reflections from the sandwich building material, we propose a metric for evaluating the wireless friendliness of a sandwich building material, i.e., the spatially averaged capacity over a room. Finally, we propose an iterative algorithm to maximize the spatially averaged capacity by jointly optimizing the relative permittivity and thickness of each layer of the sandwich building material, while ensuring its mechanical and thermal insulation requirements. Numerical results show that the spatially averaged capacity can be increased by 25%–42% via the joint optimization of the relative permittivities and thickness of all layers of a sandwich building material.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3356052","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2023RC18); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:766231,752644); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFA0711303,2021YFB3300900); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:92267202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10414382","Building wireless performance (BWP);channel model;electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation;multipath;permittivity;reflection;sandwich building material;wireless friendliness","Building materials;Wireless communication;Permittivity;Reflection;Permittivity measurement;Frequency measurement;Buildings","","1","","40","IEEE","25 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, quickly finding illuminated areas and tracing high-order rays are two main bottlenecks. A blend-tree structure consisting of the ray aggregation transfer layer (RATL) and the multiple octree layer (MOL) is proposed for the above problems. RATL assigns a conversion interface (CI) and target-seeking interface (TSI) to each target. MOL stores each octree, which is built at the initial moment and connected to CI. In shadow elimination, targets are rotated and translated for virtual display by CIs, and the scanline algorithm is used for acceleration. In high-order raytracing, the ray which enters and exits the target is transformed quickly by quaternions in CIs. The TSI determines the next target for the exiting ray. Therefore, the raytracing area is extremely limited within each bounding box and time-invariant. Furthermore, the ray marching algorithm is improved to accelerate ray tracing in octrees.

This statistical model is derived based on a full-wave S-matrix approach and using the fact that the fluctuating component of the field is a Gaussian process. The model is useful in the performance evaluation of coherent communication systems and imaging radars, such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and synthetic aperture (SAR) systems. The mean field component is represented by a field propagating in a medium with an effective refractive index characterized by the S-matrix approach. It is shown that the statistical behavior of the magnitude and phase of the fluctuating field at any point on the wavefront with respect to a reference point on the wavefront can be described by only one parameter. The statistics of the magnitude of the fluctuation field at the reference point can also be described by one more parameter. In this article, the effective refractive index of the medium for estimating the mean field and the two required parameters for describing the fluctuating field at a given point and its covariance with that of an adjacent point are given for different rain rates in the range 2–50 mm/h and at 77 GHz.

In this article, we consider multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) using inductive coupling. While an analysis of SWIPT requires a model that correctly captures transmit power, harvested power, and information capacity, the majority of previous studies have overlooked the relationship between the mathematical signal representations and the real-world physical quantities. To overcome this challenge, we propose a framework in which signals and channels are represented by traveling waves and scattering parameters. The optimal covariance matrices of the transmit traveling waves are derived for three different working scenarios. We propose a simple estimation procedure to determine unknown scattering parameters and noise distribution.

These programmable unit cells subsequently comprise a larger PMSF that provides control of the reflected magnitude and phase for a given incident wave for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations.

In the design process, first, a novel type of folded split ring resonator (FSRR) is specially engineered to serve as the basic elements that could provide two neighboring orthogonal modes within a miniaturized size. Second, to ensure each mode of the FSRRs radiates its correspondent far-field component, e.g.,  $E_{\theta }$  or  $E_{\varphi }$  with the same amplitude, which is critical to CP radiation, the coupling coefficients of two coupled FSRRs are extracted to quantitatively determine the required edge-to-edge spacing of two neighboring FSRRs. Third, to achieve tilted-beam radiation at a predefined angle, the index-modulation principle is applied to calculate the specific dimensions of each index-modulated FSRR.

However, the issue it faces is the grating lobe, which limits its application. As a typical and reliable method, the global optimization algorithm obtains the large-spacing aperiodic scanning arrays (LSASAs) with global iterative search. Nevertheless, as the array scale expands and the aperiodicity complicates further, the time cost is unacceptable, and even the algorithm cannot converge. A time-saving solution is to give a reasonable initial arrangement to reduce the time cost of subsequent optimization. Even it can be used directly due to its excellent performance. Therefore, a quasi-analytical method for generating the initial arrangement of LSASA is proposed by adapting the idea of the perturbation theory. Then, the initial arrangements of different scales and spacings obtained within a brief timeframe are used to verify the effectiveness. Moreover, a  $4\times8$  array with a relative impedance bandwidth of 21% and an average spacing of one wavelength is fabricated. The results show that the array realizes the beam steering of ±30° and ±60° with the sidelobe level (SLL) less than −9.0 and −8.3 dB in the E- and H-planes.

The electric field region of the  $TE_{11}$  mode is much smaller than the physical region of DDP.

Then, ten metal vias are loaded inside the DDP to further change the resonant frequencies of  $TE_{11}$  and  $TE_{12}$  modes. The ten metal vias also adjust the H-plane radiation pattern of  $TE_{12}$  mode and improve the impedance matching of the proposed filtering DDPA.

The proposed antenna mainly includes four parts: radiation patches, driven stubs, a square substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity, and a fork-shaped PRGW feeding structure. By introducing four U-shaped defected ground structures (DGSs), a radiation null can be obtained at the upper stopband. Meanwhile, two rectangular strips are added to the radiation patches, which not only widens the impedance bandwidth but also enhances the lower stopband suppression level.

By adjusting the slot parameters and the weighting coefficients, a cosecant-distributed radiation pattern is obtained. Due to the high radiation efficiency property of the basic cosine-shaped slots, the final radiation aperture length of the proposed antenna is only  $4\lambda _{{0}}$ , and the radiation efficiency is 67.5%. The open-stopband of the LWA at broadside radiation is naturally suppressed by the composite slot structure. Thus, the angle range of beamforming can cover broadside.

Based on this topology, a reconfigurable transmit-RA (RTRA) antenna is physically implemented, capable of switching between a 1-bit reconfigurable RA mode and a fixed beam TA mode. The key to achieving this functionality is the proposed three-state reconfigurable circuit, which utilizes two shunt p-i-n diodes to generate two reflection states with a 180° phase difference and one transmission state. The twin line is selected to build the reconfigurable circuit due to the discovery that the characteristic impedance of the transmission line is critical to the on/off performance of the shunt p-i-n diodes. As a natural consequence, half-wavelength-dipole antennas, which can be simply fed by the twin line, are used as the receiving and radiating elements. After loading the dipole antennas to the reconfigurable circuit, the length of the in-between transmission line is adjusted to stabilize the original frequency-dependent phase difference between the two reflection states at around 180° with a small variation over a wide band. A  $16\times16$ -element array was constructed and measured, demonstrating over 36% bandwidth in the broadside RA and TA modes with maximum aperture efficiencies of 27% and 29% respectively. In terms of the beam steering characteristic in the RA mode, the antenna can cover ±45° in both the E- and H-planes. It is also noteworthy that the entire RTRA surface, including the dc biasing network, is fabricated using single-layer PCBs, thus making the proposed design easy and cost-effective to fabricate.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3361153","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071308,U23A20288); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:20231121155257002,KQTD20221101093555005,ZDSYS20220527171402005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10424424","Reconfigurable antenna;reflect-array (RA);transmit-array (TA);wideband antenna","PIN photodiodes;Pins;Impedance;Topology;Reflection;Transmitting antennas;Power transmission lines","","6","","28","IEEE","7 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In comparison to the typical multilayer configurations, the proposed element can be constructed by using only two metal layers without metallic vias. It is found that the two orthogonally placed strips of each element can construct a cavity-like structure, where TPOMs are formed. Two L-shaped slots are etched on the two strips to improve the mode coupling coefficient and each pair of orthogonal modes can achieve mutual conversion, which allows to perform the rotation of polarization in two bands. The high-frequency modes and the low-frequency modes can be adjusted to resonate at the same frequency of 77 GHz, forming a 90° phase difference. By placing the position of the L-shaped structure symmetrically, the path of the mode coupling is then reversely rotated, thus forming a 180° phase difference. Using these three approaches, the 2-bit elements are realized with good performance of wideband and low loss. To realize the beam scanning in a certain range, the phase coding of the array is optimized by the main beam control method (MBCM). Finally, a circular array with 1224 elements is fabricated.

First, considering the significant differences in matrix rank and element magnitudes between the submatrix corresponding to the system excitation and the submatrix constructed by the Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) + Poggio–Miller–Chang–Harrington–Wu (PMCHW) formulation, we divide the whole matrix into two parts accordingly. Then, contrary to the traditional methods of compressing the original matrix directly, we compress the off-diagonal blocks after lower/upper (LU) decomposition. As a result, the accuracy problem of the traditional methods is solved. Finally, a parallel strategy based on block-cyclic distribution is designed to achieve the distributed parallelization of the proposed solver on high performance computing (HPC) clusters. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed solver, which achieves more than 70% parallel efficiency when the CPU cores are increased from 72 to 720, and an excellent memory complexity of  ${O}$ ( ${N}^{4/3}$ log ${N}$ ).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3356050","Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2021GXLH-02,2023ZDLGY-09,2022ZDLGY02-01); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:QTZX23018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10414388","Adaptive cross approximation (ACA);complex structures;fast direct solver;integral equations;parallel algorithm;radiation problems","Matrix decomposition;Method of moments;Transmission line matrix methods;Dielectrics;Convergence;Integral equations;Iterative methods","","3","","20","IEEE","25 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed scheme is advantageous compared to complex-signal-based methods since it is a phaseless solution. Moreover, a generalized solution jointly exploiting the frequency (i.e., using wideband scalar frequency response measurement) and spatial (i.e., using several spatial samples) domain is proposed to further improve the pattern reconstruction accuracy, where the state-of-the-art spatial-domain and the proposed frequency-domain solutions can be seen as special cases.

In this study, we investigate how engineering the metasurface properties can modify the total scattering pattern, enabling the modification and optimization of reflections from significantly larger illuminated areas than the metasurface panel. To accomplish this, a general design approach is developed to create periodical metasurfaces with controlled reflection phase and amplitude for all propagating Floquet harmonics. By combining metasurface reflections with those from the surrounding walls, the total scattering can be manipulated. The study demonstrates how appropriately designed metasurfaces can modify reflections from surrounding walls, enhancing the functionalities of metasurfaces.
