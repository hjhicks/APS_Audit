These design dilemmas can be well addressed by using the leaky-wave-enabled horn (i.e., the leaky horn), which mainly exploits the intrinsic plane-wavefront characteristics of leaky-waveguides’ wedge-shaped regions. While noticing that previously reported leaky horns are subject to a narrowband nature and somewhat limited contour designability, a leaky horn class exhibiting wideband and customizable contour characteristics, which are based on a leaky grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW), are developed in this communication. After establishing the theoretical relationship between the aperture length, flaring angle, and leakage constant of a general leaky horn and revealing several relevant design considerations, design technicalities and procedures for simultaneously realizing customizable contour and wideband radiation are systematically described for the GCPW leaky horn. For demonstration, a GCPW leaky horn example using the slow wave technique is constructed, simulated, and measured. It is verified that the proposed GCPW leaky horn has several merits like customizable contour, wide bandwidth, suppressed phase error, compact size, etc., which enable it to be a potential candidate for millimeter-wave applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3383220","Startup Research Fund of Southeast University(grant numbers:RF1028623258); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62301152,62122019,62188102); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20230819); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242022k60008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10492653","Flaring angle;grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW);horn antenna;leaky horn;leaky-wave structure;leaky-waveguide;optimum horn;phase error;slow wave structure","Apertures;Wideband;Horn antennas;Antennas and propagation;Planar waveguides;Millimeter wave communication;Millimeter wave technology","","2","","29","IEEE","4 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The structure is compact, only requiring two substrate layers while providing five radiation frequency nulls. The first layer is composed of a filtering cavity which uses the perturbed second- and third-order modes to support the two passbands. The cavity is designed to satisfy the coupling requirements of a filtering doublet, implementing three controllable inter-band transmission zeros (TZs) along with a fourth TZ above the second passband. The second layer uses a nonuniform MTS which acts as an equivalent radiating load. The novel nonuniform MTS is designed to adequately match both passbands providing a high and flat realized gain (RG), improve the higher frequency radiation patterns, retain the intrinsic filtering function, and introduce an additional inter-band radiation frequency null. A prototype is fabricated and measured demonstrating two 10-dB fractional bandwidths (FBWs) of 7.9% and 11.0%, each centered around 19 and 27 GHz, respectively.

To facilitate the fast CTL design, we propose to analytically map the CTLs’ odd-mode (OM) and even-mode (EM) characteristic impedances onto the Smith charts of the antenna’s OM and EM input impedances. By leveraging this approach, the required CTL’s OM and EM parameters for antenna decoupling can be directly determined without relying on intricate optimization or try-and-error process.

This method eliminates the reliance on the long delay line and realizes stable phase differences over a wide bandwidth. Furthermore, a miniaturized radiating element is presented. By adeptly utilizing the equivalent electric and magnetic walls, this element is tuned to resonate in the unique half TM01 and quarter TE201 modes.

Meanwhile, the cross-band mutual coupling between LB and HB antennas deteriorates the port-to-port isolation. In this article, an LB antenna is proposed to simultaneously suppress cross-band scattering and coupling at HB, which is called a dual-modal filtenna. The LB filtenna comprises slot-etched dipole and capacitive surfaces. It is studied through equivalent circuits operating in two modals, namely spatial modal and self-excited one. In the spatial modal, the LB radiator is illuminated by an HB-radiated wave and realizes a bandpass filtering response to pass the HB electromagnetic (EM) wave. Moreover, in the self-excited modal, the radiator is excited by the fed network and generates a radiation null at HB to improve the out-of-band rejection. On the LB radiator, slots forming parallel resonances are etched to suppress scattering and coupling. However, the suppression frequencies of scattering and coupling cannot simultaneously operate at HB. Then, capacitive surfaces are designed to manipulate the two suppression frequencies to HB. For validation, a dismountable dual-band array is designed. The array consists of the proposed LB (1.7–2.3 GHz) element, a  $2\times 2$  HB (2.5–2.7 GHz) array. A frequency-selective surface (FSS) is placed between them to make the array dismountable. The simulated and measured results show that the HB radiation pattern is rarely affected.

Subsequently, this dataset is used to train an inverse model, which contrasts with the original mathematical model in terms of input and output relations. This inverse approach enables the direct acquisition of high-quality antenna design solutions tailored to specific requirements, thereby bypassing the need for simulations. Consequently, this method transforms the intricate “NP” problem in antenna optimization into a more tractable “P” problem. These high-quality design solutions are then incorporated as foundational knowledge into the improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm for further refinement. This integration allows IDE to bypass initial exploratory searches, effectively reducing the journey toward the optimal solution.

In this article, the time-modulated array is combined with the relatively recent coding metasurface theory to introduce time-coding metasurface antenna (TCMA). This innovative antenna design facilitates flexible spatial modulation of electromagnetic (EM) waves without using complicated feeding network and traditional phase shifter. Hence, it enables the generation of multiple concurrent but independent-directive high-gain beams to cover a predefined angular range, unlike the conventional array antenna which has its single-directive beam that covers only one user at cellular communication.

A combination of simulations and measurements is used to achieve an as accurate as possible estimation of each uncertainty. Manufacturing uncertainties in the probe as well as the placement of electromagnetic (EM) absorbers on the probe flange show a significant influence on the transformed planar NF radiation patterns. When using an open-ended rectangular waveguide (OEWG) as a probe, manufacturing errors can reduce the trueness of the probe pattern and the resulting far-field (FF) pattern of the AUT to below 90% for  $\theta \gt 17^{\circ } $  (90 GHz) or  $\theta \gt 22^{\circ } $  (140 GHz).

Antennas of different frequency bands need to be placed together to achieve multiple communication goals. However, when a large-sized antenna operating at a low-band (LB) is used alongside a small-sized antenna operating at a high-band (HB), the radiation from the former can block the latter, thereby impacting the overall functioning of the antenna system. In this work, we propose a novel method for designing electromagnetic (EM) transparent antennas based on Drude metasurfaces. A dipole antenna made of Drude metasurfaces can maintain the radiation pattern of nearby HB antenna without compromising on radiation performance compared to the conventional metal-based one. An interconnected metasurface is designed to ensure low surface conductivity at HB yet high surface conductivity at LB, thus providing low radar cross section (RCS) compatible with the HB antennas. A prototype of the EM transparent dipole antenna is experimentally demonstrated and microwave measurements verify its capabilities in strong radiation and suppressing scattering at the LB and HB, respectively.

It is the first attempt to propose a phase difference compensation method for circularly polarized (CP) bandwidth improvement. Based on this, a new integrated structure combining frequency-selective surface (FSS) and dielectric grating structures, named FSS inserted dielectric polarizer (FIDP), is proposed. By combining the monotonically increasing phase difference of the dielectric grating structures, with the monotonically decreasing phase difference of the FSS, the proposed polarizer achieves a 90° phase difference between two orthogonal  $E$ -field components within a wide frequency range. At the same time, the magnitudes of the components are not reduced when the two  $E$ -field components pass through the polarizer. Hence, CP conversion over a wide frequency range is achieved. For validation, three feeding horns operating in adjacent bands are designed as the feeds for the polarizer. The experimental results show that the proposed polarizer yields an operating bandwidth of 88%, ranging from 6.8 to 17.5 GHz. The thickness of the polarizer is  $1.34~\lambda _{0}$ .

To obtain dual polarization under a compact size and single-layer configuration, instead of utilizing two stacked perpendicular radiators, a dual-mode annular ring resonator (ARR) which is capable of maintaining good isolation performance under multiport operation, as is commonly utilized in a hybrid ring coupler, is adopted as the basic element of the parasitic array. Different from antenna arrays whose respective element is directly fed by a specially designed feed network, dual-polarized parasitic arrays face the difficulty of achieving high XPD due to the complex intercoupling among dual polarizations and adjacent parasitic elements. To cope with this issue, an approach for polarization purity improvement of parasitic array is proposed based on thoughtfully investigating the coupling topology of the parasitic array. Moreover, mutual coupling effect is beneficial to dramatically expand the impedance bandwidth of parasitic array compared with the single element, but at the same time, deteriorated isolation performance among two ports needs to be addressed. To this end, a novel feeding scheme is proposed to further enhance the isolation performance of the developed parasitic array. Ultimately, the developed dual-polarized parasitic array exhibits a broad bandwidth of 11.6%, high isolation level of 49.7 dB, and good XPD up to 30.1 dB at a predefined tilt angle of 45°. Besides, the antenna also has a single-layer configuration, simple structure, compact size, and high efficiency.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3386356","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371080,62031006); National Science Foundation of Chongqing (CQ)(grant numbers:CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX0597); Venture and Innovation Support Program for Chongqing Overseas Returnees(grant numbers:cx2022063); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10500306","Annular ring resonator (ARR);dual polarization;high isolation;parasitic arrays;polarization purity;tilted beam","Antenna arrays;Couplings;Feeds;Topology;Resonant frequency;Periodic structures;Optical ring resonators","","2","","31","IEEE","15 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An equivalent circuit model (ECM) engineering multiple stopbands and passbands with combinations of parallel and serial resonators is proposed for dual-band design. By loading diodes in the resonator accordingly, the operating band can be switched from a low insertion loss (IL) state to a high shielding effectiveness (SE) state power-dependently. Additionally, the independence of two bands is greatly improved by using two separate layers to mount the diodes, attributing to the enhanced difference of induced voltage between diodes in different layers resulting from shielding effect of top layer. Various functions in two-frequency coincidence scenarios are analyzed, demonstrating the advantage of independent modulation. Based on the ECM, a two-layer ESS is designed. Two wide bands with IL < 1 dB under low-power incidence and SE > 20 dB under HPM are achieved, due to second-order resonance produced by double-layer configuration.

One is the mesh generation, and the other is the intensive or time-consuming solution of matrix equations which could be unbearable. Machine-learning (ML) methods provide a new perspective to tackle the problems by skipping the two steps. Point clouds can well describe the geometrical information of a radar target. Directly using the point cloud rather than the created mesh with the point data should be workable, so we will take the point cloud as the input of the neural network (NN). As for the output, we will let the NN extract a kind of inherent feature parameters (IFPs) that are distinctive to each target and independent of incident and scattering directions. The characteristic mode theory (CMT) is employed to acquire the IFPs for the generation of datasets. The scattered far-field can be readily computed using the IFPs when the incident and scattering directions are specified. We call the NN constructed to realize the function Electromagnetic PointNet (EMPN). Numerical examples show that the EMPN can achieve remarkable reductions in CPU time and even memory requirements.

Although the PEBFs were applied successfully in analyzing smooth and convex objects, they cannot accurately model the induced surface currents when geometrical singularities or strong mutual couplings are present. In such cases, the mesh elements must be small enough to describe the complicated amplitude variations accurately. One way to tackle this issue is to use a locally refined mesh. In this article, a set of rules is proposed, based on the geometrical and physical features of the problem, to identify elements that need to be locally refined. The mesh refinement is performed automatically based on the proposed rules, eliminating the need for human intervention.

However, discrepancies between predicted and measured propagation remain, which could be due in part to turbulent fluctuations of the refractive index, spatially heterogenous evaporative ducting environments, and mischaracterization of the rough ocean bottom boundary. To better understand the relative importance of these contributors, this study explores the sensitivity of X-band propagation to parameters describing sea-state conditions and refractive environments, including turbulent fluctuations and spatially heterogeneous conditions. This study employs the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (eFAST) to compute sensitivity indices that evaluate the leading-order effects and effects due to nonlinear interactions between these refractive and sea state parameters on a parabolic wave equation (PWE) EM wave propagation simulation. The parameters are delineated and evaluated in three atmospheric stability regime experiments: stable, neutral, and unstable, and consider both trapping and nontrapping propagation conditions. Parameter sensitivity indices are ranked for each experiment to examine the relative effects of the parameters on X-band propagation prediction. The results show that in neutral and stable regimes, mean evaporation duct characteristics have the greatest impact on propagation beyond the geometric horizon (BGH), while in unstable conditions, turbulence also plays a significant role. Additionally, in the lowest 10 m of the atmosphere, forward scattering from the rough sea surface has the greatest effect on propagation predictions regardless of atmospheric stability.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3396644","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-19-1-2350); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10528264","Electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation;evaporation ducts;forward scattering;global sensitivity analysis;heterogenous evaporation ducts;marine atmospheric surface layer (MASL);propagation in complex media;refractive turbulence;rough ocean surface;X-band","Atmospheric modeling;Sensitivity;Refractive index;Evaporation;Ducts;Sea surface;Computational modeling","","2","","47","CCBYNCND","9 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If the distance between the cylinders is large, their wavefields do not overlap and they can be considered independently. On the other hand, if the distance between the cylinders is small, the mode interaction becomes noticeable. This leads to a shift in the natural frequencies of the system compared with the frequencies of the noninteracting cylinders. This shift can be successfully determined using perturbation theory. Since the natural frequencies for a single cylinder are doubly degenerate due to axial symmetry, each natural frequency splits into two. Explicit expressions for the shift in natural frequency caused by the presence of the second cylinder are given, containing integrals of known functions. The dependence of the natural frequency shift on the geometrical and physical parameters of the second waveguide is calculated using the proposed approach. According to the theoretical estimates confirmed by numerical calculations, the frequency splitting is much smaller than its shift. The law of decrease in frequency change with the change in distance between cylinders is analyzed and analytical expressions for the distance corresponding to the maximum splitting of frequencies are derived. The results can be readily applied for modeling and optimization of various devices based on electromagnetic principles, such as antennas, waveguides, microdisk laser systems, transmission lines, and others.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3395847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10522622","Dielectric cylinder;dielectric waveguides;Maxwell equations;microdisk;normal modes;perturbation theory;whispering gallery modes","Perturbation methods;Dielectrics;Mathematical models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Electromagnetic waveguides;Antennas and propagation;Vectors","","","","18","IEEE","7 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The IDE is obtained using an incident/scattered-field decomposition such that the VL is considered to be the scatterer. The new formulation is applied in five distinct regions: the illuminating-source region on the left side of the lens, two regions within the lens separated by a power-transfer plane, and two regions to the right of the lens, also separated by a power-transfer plane.

So far, although there are a number of works about the creation of deep-learning algorithms to drive intelligent metasurfaces, they are mostly about fixed objects and thus constrained by specific applications. In this work, we propose a synthetic neural network to break the limit that conventional inverse design algorithms only work for certain metasurface configurations. The dynamic assembly of reconfigurable metasurfaces in physical space is directly mapped to the network recombination in algorithm space. This is particularly useful because it can greatly save training data and avoid repeated training of the network. We apply it in the inverse design of metasurfaces with a relative error of less than 13% and experimentally demonstrate reconfigurable microwave metasurfaces with flexible deployment.

The aperture is composed of two types of narrowband subwavelength unit cells, namely the wire-loop Huygens’ unit cell and the stacked I-shaped cross unit cell. The two types of unit cells collaborate to achieve complete 360° phase coverage and uphold a high transmittance (> −1.3 dB). Both unit cells possess the capability to manipulate dual polarization electromagnetic (EM) waves, exhibit strong angular stability, and have a period of  $0.165\lambda _{0}$  (where  $\lambda _{0}$  is the free space wavelength at 9 GHz). Furthermore, the subwavelength period of the unit cells enhances the sampling frequency of the aperture, thereby effectively mitigating aperture distortion caused by unit cell failure resulting from frequency variations. Hence, despite the narrowband nature of the unit cells, the aperture enables broadband performance. The proposed aperture design method offers a more efficient solution for broadband small F/D compared to the conventional TA design method, with reduced design complexity, thinner aperture thickness, and simplified unit cell structure. Finally, the proposed methodology is utilized to design the aperture of a TA prototype with an F/D of 0.32, which is equipped with a broadband magneto-electric (ME) dipole feed.

The convolution layers serve as an extractor to learn the features of the covariance matrix of the array factor (CMAF) in the nulling regions, while the FC layers serve as a regressor to predict the array excitation and the radiation pattern. However, the significant differences among the CMAF elements for different wide nulling regions make the convolutional neural network (CNN) difficult to quickly learn the samples. To overcome this shortcoming, SPL is adopted to make the CNN select samples from “easy” to “hard” in the training process by comparing the loss function and the hyper-parameter. Moreover, the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is utilized to tune the architecture hyper-parameter values of the SPL-CNN. After the SPL-CNN is well-trained, the proposed algorithm can calculate the array excitation without iteration.

The double-ridge waveguides (DRWGs) not only perform the wideband feeds with a miniaturized size, which is helpful to obtain a wider steering range without grating lobe, but also function as a high-pass filter (HPF), which enables the whole design more compact. Combining the high-pass response of DRWG and the low-pass response of the shorted stubs, the bandpass response is realized. The lower and upper cut-off frequency is independently defined, allowing for controllable bandwidth. An efficient estimated power-ratio formula to design unequal power divider (PD) is proposed to effectively guide the design of the nonuniform feed networks. Furthermore, the method of spline function as the profile curve fitting is introduced to replace the traditional Chebyshev transformer in the design of continuous transverse stub (CTS) antenna with smooth wall spline profile, reducing the requirement for machining precision. The whole antenna structure integrated the parallel plate waveguide (PPW), DRWG with coaxial feeding together, thus several special transitions are designed for field transformation and impedance matching.

The framework consists of the deep convolutional asymmetric encoder–decoder structure (DCAEDS) followed by the deep residual convolutional neural network (DRCNN). In the first step, DCAEDS utilizes EM scattered field data from a single-frequency one-time measurement to coarsely retrieve the initial contrasts (permittivities) of target scatterers. In the second step, DRCNN employs a mixed input scheme, comprising the initially reconstructed permittivities from the first step and the original EM scattered field data, to significantly improve the retrieved contrasts (permittivities) and refine the reconstruction of targets. Consequently, the proposed EM inversion solver achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency, even for high-contrast targets. The proposed solver is flexible as it is required only for a single-frequency one-time measurement on the EM scattered field. Moreover, the proposed two-step DL-based solver overcomes the limitations of conventional methods, such as high computational costs and ill-posedness. Numerical benchmarks based on various dielectric objects demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed EM inversion solver, highlighting its potential as a candidate for real-time quantitative EM inversion for high-contrast targets.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3372772","Hong Kong Research Grant Council General Research Fund (GRF)(grant numbers:12300218,12300519,17201020,17300021,C1013-21GF,C7004-21GF); Joint Natural Science Foundation of China—Research Grants Council (NSFC-RGC)(grant numbers:N-HKU76921); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:HKU PDFS2122-7S05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10464185","Convolutional neural network;electromagnetic (EM) inverse scattering;high contrast;residual learning;two-step process","Mathematical models;Electromagnetic interference;Biomedical measurement;Computational modeling;Training;Iterative methods;Frequency measurement","","4","","40","IEEE","12 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A quadrature hybrid coupler (QHC) is cascaded with two identical, mutually isolated, and orthogonally linearly polarized (LP) third-order filtering antennas to produce a CP response. Out-of-band reflections from the CP filtering antenna are dissipated through a matched load connected to the QHC’s isolated port. Each of the two LP filtering antennas has two stub resonators and a patch resonator, coupled together. The square-shaped patch resonator is dual-fed and acts as a common radiating resonator for the two LP filtering antennas by utilizing its two orthogonal modes,  $TM_{100}$  and  $TM_{010}$ . The patch is backed with a defected air cavity to increase its gain and decrease its quality factor while keeping the feeds mutually isolated. The filtering antenna operates at 6.84 GHz with a 9.06-dBic peak gain, a wide 3-dB gain bandwidth of 15.79%, and an axial ratio (AR) below 3 dB in the gain passband. Moreover, a wideband reflectionless performance is obtained with  $|S_{11}| \leq $  −10-dB bandwidth of 34% that extends on both sides of the gain passband. Suppression over 29 dB is achieved beyond 35% of band-edge frequencies of the gain passband. In addition, the monotonically decreasing all-pole response provides low dispersion losses. The low-profile (0.064  $\lambda _{0}$ ) structure can operate as a left-handed or a right-handed CP filtering antenna, interchangeably.

Simulation and experimental results show that the broadband low-RCS antenna array achieves a realized gain of 14.9 dBi at 5.3 GHz and obtains a monostatic RCSR greater than 10 dB for x and y polarization under normal incidence in the range of 3.15–8.75 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3396658","Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX23_0379); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10528247","Broadband;high gain;in-band RCSR;integrated structure of antenna array;radar cross section (RCS)","Antenna arrays;Broadband antennas;Broadband communication;Radar antennas;Antennas;Absorption;Loaded antennas","","9","","31","IEEE","9 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The overall structure is composed of a 0.125-mm-thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film with fine metal line (FML), quartz glass with a thickness of 0.5 mm, a 0.6-mm air layer, indium tin oxide (ITO) ground, and an RHCP feed horn. The overall size of the reflection plane is  $170\times 170\times 1.225$  mm. The shaped pattern of a double arrow, two diamond, and a chain with three incomplete diamonds form the circuit of unit cell. The RA cell is miniaturized ( $2.4\times 2.4$  mm) by bending the corresponding current path with a linewidth of  $40~\mu $ m. To compensate for the loss induced by the FML, we increased the resolution of the reflection plane, and the measured results showed that the peak gain and aperture efficiency (AE) reached 32.5 dBic and 54.9%, respectively. The 3-dB gain bandwidth (BW) reached 23.2% (28.5–36 GHz), and the axial ratio (AR) is less than 1.5 dB across the frequency band. These advantages, such as optical transparency, high directionality, and good circular polarization characteristics, make it a potential candidate for satellite communication applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3400024","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62125105,62301199,62371255); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LGG21F010007,LQ23F010017); Research Program(grant numbers:2022-JCJQ-JJ-0602); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10534173","Fine metal line (FML) structure;circularly polarized (CP);reflectarray (RA);transparent antenna","Optical reflection;Optical polarization;Reflection;Optical design;Antennas and propagation;Metals;Gain","","3","","20","IEEE","17 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Closed-form expressions for depolarization dyadics have been developed for truncated spheres and truncated spheroids, and the formalism has been extended to truncated ellipsoids; the evaluation of depolarization dyadics for this latter case requires numerical integration. The Hölder continuity condition has been exploited to fix the origin of the coordinate system for the evaluation of depolarization dyadics. These results will enable theoretical studies involving scattering from small particles and homogenization of particulate composite materials to accommodate particles with a much wider range of shapes than was the case hitherto.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3399027","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K.(grant numbers:EP/V046322/1); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:DMS-1619901); Charles Godfrey Binder Endowment at Penn State; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10531149","Depolarization dyadic;Hölder continuity;singularity;truncated sphere;truncated spheroid","Antennas and propagation;Shape;Ellipsoids;Current density;Closed-form solutions;Scattering;Green's function methods","","4","","21","IEEE","15 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the hybrid ACA-PO method, the ACA technique, which is based on the specific properties of the Green function, can be employed to compress the self-impedance matrix of the MoM region, as well as the interaction matrices between the MoM and PO regions. By introducing the ACA into MoM-PO, the initial dense matrices are compressed which resulting in a substantial reduction in memory consumption. In addition, the hybrid ACA-PO method utilizes the decomposed low-rank matrix to solve the current, which can efficiently perform matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) related to MoM and PO regions. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed hybrid method in comparison to the conventional MoM-PO and ACA methods.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3400036","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271366,62394293,62394290); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10534212","Adaptive cross-approximation (ACA);carrier antenna array analysis;hybrid method;large-scale platform;method of moments-physical optics (MoM-PO)","Method of moments;Vectors;Surface impedance;Matrix decomposition;Memory management;Impedance;Computational complexity","","2","","16","IEEE","17 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
