Metal stubs are added to the electric dipole patches at the terminal positions. It is found that the coupled current of the adjacent antenna primarily localizes near the metal stubs, exhibiting its strongest amplitude at the stub terminals. Through appropriate adjustment of the metal stub lengths, the coupled current can establish a node with zero amplitude at the antenna’s center. As a result, energy cannot ingress into the receiving port via the coupling slot, resulting in enhanced isolation. To validate this method, a prototype of a  $1\times 2$  MIMO ME dipole antenna array is simulated, fabricated, and tested. The measured results demonstrate a wide operating bandwidth of 28.1%, spanning from 25.1 to 33.3 GHz.

For material selection, radiation seeks high electrical conductivity and is indifferent to thermal conductivity, whereas dissipation is the opposite. Thus, antenna and thermal engineers must compete for territory to achieve good performance in their respective fields. This article firstly proposes the concept of heat-dissipating mobile antenna, highlighting the advantages of achieving extremely small antenna clearances and integrated heat-dissipating function. Different from conventional mobile antennas made up of metal/dielectrics, novel graphene with high electrical conductivity ( $1.1\times 10^{6}$  S/m) is adopted for antenna design, while its high thermal conductivity also indicates good dissipation capability. Thus, antennas and heat dissipation achieve material/space sharing, significantly expanding the spaces for both. By resorting to the radiative metasurface made of this novel graphene, experimental results show that the frame monopoles at 2.5/3.5 GHz with clearances of 0.2 mm achieve the impedance bandwidths and average efficiencies of 280/540 MHz and −3.6/−2.6 dB, respectively, while the maximum temperatures are reduced by 3.5/2.5° C and 3.1/5.0° C for the heat sources of system-on-chip and camera, respectively, compared to the conventional heat-dissipating design.

The proposed antenna works at 915 and 2450 MHz with the respective fractional bandwidths (FBWs) of 23.6% and 12.14%. The two-port MIMO system consists of two triangular-shaped radiators arranged face-to-face, forming a square configuration. The edge-to-edge distance between the radiators is 0.3 mm, indicating that the radiating elements are placed extremely close to each other. Three semicircular slots, three edge slots in the patch, a conducting via in each patch, and a high permittivity substrate are utilized to reduce the antenna’s volume ( $9.8\times 9.8\times 0.3=28.81$  mm3). To minimize electromagnetic (EM) coupling between both patches, a diagonal slot measuring  $12.5\times 0.3$  mm2 is etched in the ground plane, and a 6.5-nH inductor is added between the radiating patches. As a result, the mutual coupling values of −35.85 and −31.6 dB are observed at 915 and 2450 MHz, respectively. The effectiveness of the MIMO system is validated through the analysis of specific absorption rate (SAR) and link budget performance, both showing satisfactory results.

When extremely compact dimensions are considered, the high-order spherical harmonics required to construct a directive radiation pattern become mainly dissipative, causing radiation efficiency drops. To account for the impact of the losses, the proposed synthesis procedure integrates a specific formulation of the modal dissipation factor  $({\delta }_{n})$  associated with the excited spherical harmonics. The excitation coefficients, results of the optimization, demonstrate improved efficiency for endfire arrays of two, three, and four elements if compared to a superdirective solution. These results are scalable to a higher number of elements as well as other element distributions and types of radiators. In addition to the numerical validation through full-wave electromagnetic simulations, a prototype based on a four-element array is designed and experimentally characterized to validate the proposed analysis.

Here, we develop transmitarrays to efficiently generate flat-top and isoflux beams from the first principle of field superposition with negligible optimizations by performing phase symmetry operations. The theoretical analysis not only facilitates the shaping of flat-top and isoflux beams but also exhibits controllable beamwidths. Two prototypes using four-layer double-ring unit cells are fabricated and measured from 27 to 29 GHz. Experimental validation confirms the efficacy of the phase symmetry operations in generating flat-top beams with adjustable beamwidths.

To mitigate such a drawback, a greedy method, which we call the warping-driven maximum noise propagation error (MNPE) algorithm, is introduced. Antenna under test (AUT) diagnostics is cast as the reconstruction of an equivalent surface current. Starting from a densely populated initial grid, the algorithm selects the sampling points one by one till the noise factor (NF), a figure that controls the propagation of noise from data to the source reconstruction and does not meet a slowly varying region. Hence, the procedure is arrested since no relevant further NF reduction would be obtained. It is shown that MNPE allows for a significant data reduction compared to other literature methods, especially when the starting grid is chosen according to the recently introduced warping sampling theory. Moreover, the initial grid selected according to the warping sampling, in turn, allows to dramatically reduce the computational cost of the selection procedure. A distinctive feature of the MNPE is that a priori information about the AUT can be easily included by projecting the unknown current onto properly selected base functions. As an example of that, we exploit the a priori information concerning the size of the source and the measurement aperture that leads to the radiation pattern being reliable within a bounded part of the visible spectrum (i.e., the so-called valid angle region). Extensive numerical analysis and a few experimental results pertaining to planar scanning confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in dramatically reducing the amount of data without incurring performance degradation while estimating the source spatial spectrum.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3441826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10638457","Antenna testing;antennas;field sampling strategy;greedy method;near-field measurements","Antenna measurements;Standards;Particle measurements;Noise;Atmospheric measurements;Antenna radiation patterns;Testing","","1","","45","IEEE","16 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In demanding applications such as radio astronomy, the thermal noise emitted by the multilayered substrate below the antenna array may become significant and needs to be properly characterized. Both the intensity of the noise at each port and the correlation of the noise at pairs of ports need to be quantified. In this article, we provide a spectral formulation to calculate the noise correlation matrix of antenna arrays. The method is based on the propagative and evanescent plane wave spectrum emitted by each pair of active antenna ports into the lossy layered medium and thus can be implemented as a postprocessing step combined with any full-wave numerical solver. This formulation allows us to account for layered media with different physical temperatures at each layer. Numerical examples are provided using square kilometer array (SKA) stations lying on a finite ground plane, itself lying on a layered semi-infinite soil. The behaviors of noise power and noise correlation coefficients are studied for different positions of the antennas on the ground plane. This is done considering multilayered soil with different moisture levels. A very good agreement with the commercial software FEKO is observed regarding the evaluation of the noise correlation coefficients. Moreover, the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of computation time is shown by comparison with FEKO.

The antenna is designed by combining the electromagnetic fields of a half-mode cavity and a radiating slot operating in their fundamental modes. Frequency tuning is achieved using a single varactor mounted on a superstrate to form a capacitive tuning network above the slot aperture. The superstrate design provides a simple yet effective means to reconfigure the frequency using fewer tuning elements, lower losses, and improved biasing feasibility than other semiconductor-based tunable slot antennas. Two in-house manufactured prototypes of the antenna, implemented using substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technology, demonstrated tuning ranges of 7.8–11.1 GHz (35%) and 9.6–11.1 GHz (14.5%). Finally, the proposed superstrate-loaded antenna element is co-designed with a contactless-tuned evanescent-mode (EVA-mode) cavity resonator within a filtenna unit. Due to the integrated filtering capability, the out-of-band radiation suppression is better than 20 dB across the tuning range.

By articulately controlling the bias conditions of the p-i-n diodes, the novel MRFSS structure can exhibit multiple functions under different working states, whereas the frequency tunability is attained in each state by adjusting the reverse bias voltage of the varactor diode. Under the OFF (top side)-OFF (bottom side) state of the p-i-n diodes, the MRFSS exhibits a bandpass transmission response tuning from 1.68 to 2.56 GHz having an insertion loss of around 1.8–2.9 dB.

The RMS’s design is characterized by its polarization insensitivity and wide-angle reception capabilities, along with efficient conversion efficiency sustained during flight. Owing to its flexibility, lightweight, and high efficiency, the RMS is a promising candidate for UAV-supported wireless power transfer.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3439650","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371321); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2024NSFSC1410); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3900300); Ministry of Education Science and Technology Chunhui Plan Project(grant numbers:HZKY20220559); King’s College London Starting Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10634122","Airborne vibration;flexible rectifying metasurface;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);wireless power transfer","Metasurfaces;Absorption;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Rectifiers;Radio frequency;Microwave oscillators;Impedance","","2","","44","IEEE","12 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This HB array includes dual-band antennas (HB1: 3.4–3.6 GHz and HB2: 4.7–4.9 GHz) along with HB2 antennas, all arranged in an interleaved configuration with each other. The blockage effect caused by the LB antenna results in significant distortion in the radiation patterns of the MB and HB antennas, presenting an unavoidable challenge within the shared-aperture array. To maintain normal radiation patterns, the radiating patches of the LB antenna are converted into electromagnetically transparent structures. This is accomplished by incorporating corresponding multi-FSS structures designed to operate within the frequency bands of the MB and HB antennas. Therefore, the radiated waves from MB and HB antennas can propagate with reduced blockage effect.

The considered MTSs consist of dense metallic claddings printed over a dielectric slab, which are modeled through homogenized penetrable impedance boundary conditions (PIBCs). The desired conversion is obtained through a proper locally periodic modulation of the PIBC, whose profile is designed through an effective systematic procedure based on analytical formulas. These latter are derived from the Floquet-wave (FW) expansion of fields and currents over the sinusoidally modulated impedance surface that locally matches the actual structure. This approach provides an accurate control of both the amplitude and phase of the aperture field, which allows for high conversion efficiencies and a general radiation pattern. Another advantage of the proposed analytically driven procedure is that it leads to impedance profiles with smooth spatial variations, which can be easily implemented through subwavelength patches of variable size. The effectiveness of the procedure is demonstrated by designing MTSs that couple SWs and space waves (SPWs) in different scenarios. Moreover, MTSs are designed, which first convert the impinging signal into an SW and then convert it back to an SPW with prescribed characteristics. This latter example can find application in future smart radio environments (SREs), making it a valid alternative to reflecting intelligent surfaces (RISs).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3454826","Doctoral Grant (Programma Operativo Nazionale Ricerca e Innovazione 2014–2020) from the Italian Government’s Ministero dell’Universitá e della Ricerca; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10678852","Antennas;Floquet waves (FWs);leaky waves (LWs);metasurface (MTS);smart radio environment (SRE);surface waves (SWs)","Modulation;Impedance;Metasurfaces;Surface impedance;Surface waves;Periodic structures;Slabs","","4","","42","CCBY","11 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The root of this problem is the drift in electrode potential caused by imbalances in the electrodes’ electrical processes, which are unavoidable in potential-difference measurements based on the conduction current. Here, we propose the variable dielectric polarization (VDP) measurement method, which uses the variation of a dielectric between the electrodes to measure the external electric field. This method modulates the electric field signal to higher frequencies, allowing separation of the signal from the output by demodulation. This not only separates the signal from low-frequency noise, but it also increases the measurement sensitivity by frequency boosting. The results of our experiments show that the VDP system we constructed has a measurement sensitivity of 2.63 V/(V/m) and a measurement resolution of  $22.4~\mu $ V/m. Under long-term measurements, the measured drift of the VDP system (106 ( $\mu $ V/m)/day) was found to be only 1/320 of the self-potential (SP) method (34 (mV/m)/day). The proposed VDP method, thus, provides a new approach to the construction of future IoUT devices and the prediction of marine disasters.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3439821","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3205700); Deep Blue Program of Shanghai Jiao Tong University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10636014","In situ;marine electric field;sensing;stability","Electrodes;Electric variables measurement;Sea measurements;Geologic measurements;Dielectric measurement;Electric potential;Electrical resistance measurement","","1","","37","IEEE","13 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The field-impulses not only provide satisfactory resolution to various shortcomings of fields/potentials, but also facilitate simple and versatile numerical computations. They overcome the inadequacy of fields and the issues of gauge-dependent potentials in classical and quantum EM. The significance and advantages of field-impulses are discussed and compared against those of fields and potentials, in physical, mathematical, and computational aspects. The single electric field-impulse is sufficient to aptly describe all EM, including electrostatics, magnetostatics, and electrodynamics. For the excitation of field-impulses, we resort to a universal current-impulse source in lieu of traditional charges and currents. Such current-impulse can encapsulate simultaneously all static charges, direct current and time-varying dynamic sources. Moreover, it is inherently complying with charge conservation and current continuity condition. There is no need to explicitly impose such condition as required for traditional charges and currents. The FDTD update equations for field-impulses with current-impulse source are much simpler with significantly fewer terms and arithmetic operations compared to those for potentials.

The IE assigns to each elemental source auxiliary sources that significantly attenuate its radiation into the scatterer. Choosing the auxiliary sources to effectively form impenetrable convex reflective “shields” in front of each source forces most interactions to be via creeping waves. This reduces the effective dimensionality of weak and strong admissibility interactions between source and observer regions that are smaller or comparable in size to the shield and enhances the low-rank (LR) compressibility of the corresponding moment matrix blocks. For strong admissibility interactions between larger subdomains, the singular values (SVs) are greatly attenuated but decay similar to their conventional IE counterparts. The enhancement of their LR compressibility is achieved by “dynamically” adjusting the truncation threshold to account for the attenuation, compared to the conventional IE counterparts, without increasing the solver error. A fast method is also proposed for avoiding the costly repeated computation of the modified IE kernel. It uses coarse and tailored sampling and interpolation of phase- and amplitude-compensated representations of the entire kernel or its components, in accordance with their ray-asymptotic behavior, in a region dependent manner. The results validate the proposed IE formulation and demonstrate the associated LR compressibility and fast direct solver performance enhancement.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3420119","Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(grant numbers:677/18); Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(grant numbers:442/22); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10584456","Algebraic compression;direct solvers;fast solvers;integral equations (IEs);moment methods","Costs;Observers;Method of moments;Kernel;Integral equations;Testing;Iterative methods","","2","","55","IEEE","3 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This difficulty arises because junction points must align with surface mesh vertices, imposing additional constraints on mesh generation. To address this limitation and enhance the flexibility of mesh generation for complex structures, in this work, we extend the discontinuous Galerkin integral equation (DGIE) method to surface-wire structures, so that the mesh for wire and surface can be discretized independently. The nonoverlapping subdomain partitioning scheme and the simple basis function definitions for surface-wire junctions are provided. Similar to the surface DGIE method, the numerical discretization procedure is derived to guarantee the current continuity and zero charge accumulation on the DG contour lines, to ensure the correctness of electromagnetic analysis.

The rotation symmetrical geometry of the designed FSS demonstrates unique stopband features for TM and TE polarization modes. The ultra-miniaturized unit cell is completed by fractal technology. It leads to high stopband stability with wide angular incident angle (AIA) up to 60° and 80° at TM and TE polarization modes, respectively. Moreover, the low periodicity of the FSS significantly reduces the peak transmission zero (TZ) frequency shifting at high AIA, which is only 0.21%. The peak TZ is tunable by adding an additional substrate layer with the FSS. Good agreement is accomplished between the simulation, equivalent circuit, and measurement results.

The factors contributing to the non-uniformity of EDH are analyzed using the Spearman rank correlation method, and the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) error on the non-uniformity of EDH is also examined. The findings are as follows: 1) the Xisha Islands (XS) show the most non-uniformity in EDH, while the distributions of EDH in the Hainan Island (HN) and Nansha Islands (NS) are fairly uniform; 2) the primary factor related to the non-uniformity of EDH in the HN region is relative humidity (RH)—when ASTD  $\geq 0$ —and wind speed (WS)—when ASTD <0. However, the main factor related to the non-uniformity of EDH in the XS and NS regions is atmospheric temperature when ASTD  $\geq 0$ , and WS when ASTD <0; and 3) the SST errors mainly affect the percentage distribution of EDH difference when its absolute value is less than 2 m.

How to effectively place a set of transmitters in an environment is a long-standing problem that has been widely studied over the years. This process has mainly relied on expensive measurement campaigns, low-fidelity empirical models, or high-fidelity but time-consuming simulations. Recent advances in scientific machine learning (ML) create new possibilities for overcoming this dichotomy between speed and accuracy. In this article, we train a deep neural network (U-Net) to predict the received signal strength (RSS) levels generated by multiple transmitters within a variety of different geometries. Then, we leverage the computational efficiency of the trained model to determine the position of transmitters in new geometries, both generated and real. This approach dramatically accelerates the process of selecting the position of access points (APs), meeting multiple optimization objectives in an efficient manner.

Due to the wavelength exceeding 1 m, most 100-MHz mobile antennas are long-external whips, which not only affect portability but also degrade mechanical strength. This work proposes the first foldable 100-MHz mobile antennas. Mobile terminals are mostly in the standby mode, so eliminating external antennas in the standby mode is beneficial for portability and strength. A segment of nitinol memory alloy is adhered to a flexible copper-clad laminate, constituting the foldable antenna branch. In the standby mode, the antenna is completely hidden on the side surface of the terminal under external force. In the operational mode, the release of the force allows the antenna to spring out quickly and exhibit high performance. The mechanical property of the nitinol alloy is analyzed. The proposed antenna operates at two frequencies, with the printed copper strip for 280 MHz and nitinol for 433.92 MHz. Classical donut-shaped patterns with the measured maximum gains of 1.1/1.8 dBi and out-of-roundnesses of 1.9/1.3 dB are obtained. The reflection coefficient is stable after folding 50–500 times, demonstrating robust mechanical performance and practical value.

One of the dipoles operates on the fundamental mode (odd-mode), and the other works on the high-order mode (even-mode).

By ingeniously introducing small strips, the dipoles can be series-fed in the center with in-phase/out-of-phase shifting, thereby reducing the number of feeding ports. The positive and negative excitations of the strip-loaded dipole are controlled by two PIN diodes. Consequently, the relative phase of the even-odd-mode and the beams could be reconfigured.

The miniaturization is achieved by loading spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) structures on nonradiation edges of the stacked patches. Meanwhile, the wideband operation is realized by controlling the difference in propagation constants of the stacked patches. Due to the large propagation constant of the SSPP structures, the size of the antenna is reduced to  $0.18\times 0.18~\lambda _{0}^{2}$ , which achieves 72% footprint reduction as compared with the conventional patch antennas on the same substrates. Moreover, both the simulation and measurement show that the proposed miniaturized antenna exhibits a wide bandwidth of more than 16%. To explore its applications in compact multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems, a miniaturized wideband decoupling scheme is further proposed by introducing a coupling null at the lower resonant frequency using an SSPP-loaded defected ground structure (DGS). Experimental results show that high isolation larger than 20 dB is achieved over the wide bandwidth with a center-to-center spacing of  $0.28~\lambda _{0}$ .","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3416680","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807304); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62188102,61831016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10571811","Coupling suppression;miniaturized antennas;multi-input-multi-output (MIMO);spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP);stacked patch antennas","Patch antennas;Wideband;Resonant frequency;Microstrip;Broadband antennas;Antennas;Antenna measurements","","7","","25","IEEE","25 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both communication transmitters using uniform and gradient metasurfaces are able to achieve high-efficiency polarization conversion and thus can cooperate with the receiver end to mitigate the interference generated by environmental carrier sources. To achieve the directional information transmission, we design a corner reflector metasurface and a gradient metasurface, which, respectively, enhances the gain in the backward and fixed scattering directions.

Metasurfaces (MTS) allow the tailoring of pencil and shaped beams with a low-profile radiator, but scanning with MTSs remains difficult, e.g., reconfiguring each subwavelength patch of the MTS defeats the initial purpose of simplicity. This communication proposes a novel design approach to beam scanning with surface-wave (SW)-based MTS antennas. Both the feeding and the MTS are made periodic at a scale of a few wavelengths. To avoid grating lobes, the unit cell of the periodic MTS is designed, such that the embedded element pattern (EEP) has a nearly rectangular shape with proper width. The sparsity of the feeding system enables a drastic reduction of the density of electronics at the expense of a smaller field of view. The resulting antenna, demonstrated here in 2-D (uniform antenna versus one space coordinate), has low profile (including the feeder) and enables continuous beam scanning with high gain. With a spacing of two wavelengths between feeds, the scan range is +/−10°. The MTS is first designed at the surface impedance level, and the resulting structure has then been validated through full-wave simulation of a MTS implemented with subwavelength patches. Numerical analysis versus frequency indicates a pattern bandwidth of the order of 5%.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3439776","Research Fellow Aspirant (ASP) grant through Belgium Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS); European FITNESS Pathfinder Project(grant numbers:101098996); Computational Resources that have been provided by the Supercomputing Facilities, Université catholique de Louvain (CISM/UCL); Consortium des Équipements de Calcul Intensif en Fédération Wallonie Brussels (CÉCI); Fond de la Recherche Scientifique de Belgique (F.R.S.-FNRS) and by theWalloon Region(grant numbers:2.5020.11); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10636049","Beam scanning;embedded element pattern (EEP);metasurface (MTS);periodic method of moments (MoM);sparse array","Phased arrays;Antenna arrays;Slabs;Impedance;Antennas;Metasurfaces;Dielectrics","","4","","41","CCBY","13 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Preconditioning strategies leveraging these projectors are capable of curing the low-frequency breakdown that severely compromises the accuracy and conditioning of the EFIE.

Initially, CBFM divides the target into multiple subdomains, with each subdomain is enclosed with its respective local Cartesian grid. Then, the macro basis functions within each subdomain are transformed into the local Cartesian grid. The AIM is utilized to accelerate the construction of CBFs, and the matrix vector multiplication process in the reduced matrix is carried out by the fast Fourier transform (FFT). In addition, the equivalent dipole moment (EDM) is introduced to speed up the calculation of the interaction between subdomains. Numerical results show that the proposed method successfully addresses the problem that conventional AIM is only suitable for computing targets with dense distributions of unknowns.
