First, the antenna radiating arms are widened to enhance the antenna design freedom. By analyzing the wide-arm dipole, mode1 and mode2 are obtained. Second, slots are cut horizontally on both sides of the antenna to optimize the current path of mode1 and to obtain mode3. Meanwhile, the introduced “semi-rectangular” shaped current further reduces the physical dimensions of the antenna effectively and optimizes the impedance matching in full-wave modes. Afterward, with the help of three longitudinal slots, the third-order mode (mode4) and the fourth-order mode (mode5) of mode1 are shifted into the operating band. Finally, by adjusting the length of the slots to control the distribution of the five modes, the bandwidth of the proposed antenna is greatly improved. A four-notch resonant loop is loaded on the top of the antenna to enhance gain. Two single-polarized antennas are placed orthogonally to obtain the designed dual-polarized antenna. Based on the above principle, a wideband antenna is designed and fabricated. The proposed antenna exhibits a reflection coefficient of less than −15 dB in the operating band (1.3–3.0 GHz) with smaller physical dimensions of  $0.36\lambda _{\max } \times 0.26\lambda _{\max } \times 0.36\lambda _{\max }$ . Additionally, the peak gain of the antenna achieves 5.6 dBi and the efficiency of the antenna is maintained above 80%. Compared with a traditional dipole, the bandwidth of the proposed antenna has been greatly improved, exhibiting a broad application prospect in the detection domain.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3445531","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2241206,62471354); ZTE Industry-Academia-Research Cooperation; 111 Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10645753","Dual-polarization;miniaturization;mode analysis and recombination;wideband","Dipole antennas;Broadband antennas;Slot antennas;Wideband;Substrates;Antennas;Antenna feeds","","2","","37","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design is based on the integral-equation formulation with a current-only approach, in which the surface impedance profile is derived only after the optimal current is found; this allows to avoid the solution of the forward problem at all steps of the algorithm, with a drastic reduction of computational resources; it does not require any assumption on the impedance profile. We also show how a 3-D feed can be accounted for in a hybrid scheme partially employing commercial 3-D simulation software. Application examples address center-fed circular metasurface antennas, in which the feed is not connected to the metasurface, and rectangular “strip-like” leaky wave antennas (LWAs) where the metasurface is electrically connected to the feeding surface.

However, due to the extremely difficult excitation of the Rydberg atoms that resonate with the SW frequency, the sensitivity of the Rydberg atoms SW measurement is low. Here, we report that a method to improve the SW sensitivity by using an SW resonator, which is extremely small in electrical size ( $0.0043\lambda \times 0.0035\lambda \times 0.007\lambda $ ), can achieve continuous resonant frequency coverage from 9.365 to 10.223 MHz and can increase the sensitivity of electric field measurement by a factor of 8633.

The proposed method enables the calibration of an antenna under test (AUT) with a compact measurement distance and a probe scanning aperture as small as 1/10 of the AUT aperture. The calibration measurement can be implemented by moving a probe antenna in a sparse grid along a line segment parallel to the AUT and collecting the AUT array element response. In the proposed method, an ideal virtual linear array is employed to model the AUT, where the virtual AUT possesses the same configuration as the AUT and consists of array elements with consistent radiation characteristics. The virtual AUT is determined by minimizing the difference between the response of the virtual and actual AUT, where the virtual AUT response can be constructed based on plane wave expansion. The least square (LS) method is applied to minimize the difference, while an optimization algorithm is employed to solve the radiation characteristics and the initial excitations of the virtual AUT. In the validation measurement, a nonuniform linear array (NULA) is calibrated in the near field using the proposed method with a probe scanning aperture of only 1/10 of the AUT aperture and a measurement distance of 4.33 wavelengths at 2.6 GHz.

Such functionality is achieved by designing a novel quadruple-ridged waveguide element with the capability of providing the simultaneous geometric phase and propagation phase control of the transmitted waves by rotating the ridges and tuning the waveguide height, allowing for the irrelevant synthetic phase profiles of the transmitted waves for LHCP and RHCP incidences.

A dual-circularly polarized (dual-CP) horn with two ports for respective LHCP and RHCP wave generation is used as the feed. Both simulated and measured near- and far-field results validate the effectiveness of the proposed dual-mode OAM lens antenna.

These two antennas realize ultrawide bandwidth and can share a radiation aperture. Meanwhile, the ME dipole acts as a parasitic structure, which greatly improves the impedance matching of the TSA in the working band.

In this article, it is proposed to use a combination of active direct matching for the antenna and a mode-based beamforming signal processing approach at the receiver to achieve a broadband gain of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that approaches the theoretical directivity of the array. The theory of such “supergain” reception is presented for a small number of infinitesimal dipole antennas, and numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate an SNR improvement that is consistent with the theoretical prediction.

Theoretical analysis indicates that this feed architecture offers particularly high isolation. Generally, for two-port antennas (with one port supporting Wi-Fi 6 applications and another supporting Wi-Fi 6E applications), suppressing mutual coupling effects using traditional filters is challenging owing to the extremely narrow guard band of 0.09 GHz. The CDHF decoupling method offers a filter-free solution to this problem.

The dominant TM0 mode and the higher order TE1 mode are utilized to achieve dual-polarized radiation. Drawing on the theory of constant refractive index lenses, we initially fill the parallel-plate waveguide with a material of uniform refractive index to ensure beam focusing for vertical polarization (TM0 mode). Subsequently, by adjusting the waveguide spacing—a modification that does not affect the effective refractive index for vertical polarization—we align the effective refractive index for horizontal polarization closely with that of vertical polarization, thereby maintaining relative stability and achieving beam focusing for the horizontal polarization. This approach obviates the need for gradient refractive index materials, thus substantially reducing design complexity and manufacturing costs. To validate our proposed concept, we designed, fabricated, and tested a transmission-type circular PPLA and a reflection-type semicircular PPLA. The test results demonstrate that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed lens antenna can cover the entire Ka-band and potentially extend to even higher frequency bands. Moreover, the peak gain of the antenna increases with frequency within the Ka-band. The proposed antenna offers wideband, dual-polarization, and high-gain radiation characteristics.

In this study, a combination of the multifunctional decoupling parasitic structure (MDPS) and the crown-type decoupling parasitic structure (CDPS) was introduced to the dual-polarized crossed-dipole antenna array to improve isolation between two adjacent elements. MDPS is critical for miniaturizing of the antenna unit, broadening its beamwidth, and decoupling between adjacent cross-polarized elements. The CDPS decouples adjacent co-polarized elements.

The solution employs a full-metal unit cell, which was conceived as the transmission equivalent of the blazed grating opaque metallic structures operating in retrodirective reflection. The unit cell is based on a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) topology, while basic filter analysis for a bandpass response has also been employed. This TEM topology brings significant reduction of the 3-D cell’s periodicity allowing operation in the subwavelength regime, so that grating lobes are avoided. This, in turn, brings enhanced angular stability in terms of amplitude and phase transmission for both TE and TM incidence. The principal application of the proposed dichroic mirror relates to the Deep Space antenna. Owing to the blazed grating concept, the unit cell was optimized for an incident elevation angle of  $\theta = 30^{\circ }$ . The blazed architecture, the filtering synthesis, design details toward a 3-D-printing compatible solution, and equivalent circuit analysis of the unit cell are described in detail. Numerical results show that the proposed solution exhibits a very robust RF performance. The characterized reflection coefficient remains below −10 dB, the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) above 16.5 dB, the low-band (i.e.,  $0.4f_{0}$ ) rejection below −26 dB, and the transmission losses below 0.5 dB for both TE and TM incidence over a wide frequency bandwidth ( $\approx 25$ %) and angular range ( $0^{\circ } \le \theta \le 40^{\circ }$ ). The simulation results of a linearly polarized horn that illuminates the proposed dichroic mirror have been verified by measurements, which included two prototypes fabricated in selective laser melting (SLM) using aluminum alloy. In light of the favorable performance, the proposed solution constitutes an appealing candidate for dichroic mirrors of Deep Space missions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3434455","Key Technology Domain (KTD) Research and Innovation Program Between Thales Alenia Space and Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA) de Rennes; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10620378","3-Dperiodic structures;3-D printing;additive manufacturing;blazed unit cell;deep space antenna;dichroic mirror;equivalent circuit;frequency selective surface (FSS);parallel plate waveguide (PPW);selective laser melting (SLM);spatial filter","Mirrors;Gratings;Deep-space communications;Bandwidth;Microwave filters;Topology;Reflection","","1","","54","IEEE","1 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This capability is obtained using a reflecting Luneburg lens (RLL) beamformer made of two stacked circular parallel plate waveguides (PPWs). The bottom PPW hosts a graded index medium that collimates the rays coupled by a corner reflector to the top PPW, where the CTS array is located. This design capitalizes on the RLL’s rotational symmetry, using a circular array of feeds to generate multiple planar wavefronts that illuminate the CTS array across a 360° range. Consequently, a new series-fed CTS array has been introduced to ensure high aperture efficiency when excited from diametrically opposed ends. The appropriate selection of the feeds, combined with the rotation of the CTS plane, enables the generation of simultaneous independent beams with continuous scanning. This architecture enhances the capabilities of conventional variable inclination CTS arrays. A prototype has been fabricated and tested, demonstrating excellent performance between 17.3 and 21.2 GHz, with an aperture efficiency of 43.5%–58% and a radiation efficiency of 90%. The antenna achieves scanning up to 55° in azimuth and from 5° to 65° in elevation through port switching, and full-azimuthal coverage with the added mechanical rotation.

This is because user demands of higher data rate require an increase in carrier frequencies, which in turn reduce the diffraction effects (and hence coverage) in complex multipath environments. Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have been proposed as a way of restoring coverage by adaptively reflecting incoming electromagnetic waves in desired directions. This is accomplished by judiciously adding extra phases at different points on the surface. In practice, these extra phases are only available in discrete quantities due to hardware constraints. Computing these extra phases is computationally challenging when they can only be picked from a discrete distribution, and existing approaches for solving this problem were either heuristic or based on evolutionary algorithms. We solve this problem by proposing fast algorithms with provably optimal solutions. Our algorithms have linear complexity, and are presented with rigorous proofs for their optimality. We show that the proposed algorithms exhibit better performance. We analyze situations when unwanted grating-lobes arise in the radiation pattern, and discuss mitigation strategies, such as the use of triangular lattices and prephasing techniques, to eliminate them. We also demonstrate how our algorithms can leverage these techniques to deliver optimum beamforming solutions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3463805","Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India through the “6G: Sub-THz Wireless Communication with Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS)”(grant numbers:R-23011/3/2022-CC&BT-MeitY); Qualcomm 6G University Research India Program through “Intelligent Approaches to Designing and Building Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for 6G applications”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10694729","Beamforming;grating-lobe mitigation;intelligent reflecting surface (IRS);optimization;passive beamforming;phase shift;surface reflectance;wireless networks","Array signal processing;Optimization;Gratings;Complexity theory;Prevention and mitigation;Quantization (signal);Phased arrays","","2","","35","IEEE","25 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with the uniform impedance resonator (UIR) loop, the SIR loop can perform a lower fundamental resonant frequency while raising its first-order resonant frequency by adjusting characteristic impedances of its different sections, thus facilitating a wider absorption bandwidth. The voltage-controlled PIN diode is then properly loaded for the lossy characteristics of the SIR, thereby simultaneously enabling ultrawideband and tunable absorption intensity. Detailed analysis of a quarter-wavelength lossy SIR is conducted to reveal the resonant mode characteristics. Moreover, the equivalent circuit model (ECM) of the lossy-SIR-based absorber is developed to explain the operating principle and facilitate our discussion on the parametric effects. Finally, the proposed absorber is fabricated by the flexible printed circuit process and measured to verify the design methodology. The measured effective absorption bandwidth is 4.3–17.8 GHz (122.1%) for transverse electric (TE) polarization, and 5.2–17.6 GHz (108.7%) for transverse magnetic (TM) polarization.

To realize rapid design of RISs, we propose a zero-pole-based multiport model to calculate the reflection coefficients and scattering patterns of RISs in this work. Specifically, the developed model establishes an accurate mapping relation between the element reflection coefficient and the loads on multiple internal ports by using the multiport S-parameter matrix. Additionally, the vector fitting method is employed to reduce the time cost of data acquisition for multiport S-parameters, in which a hybrid sampling scheme is employed to accelerate computation speed while keeping high accuracy. Using this model, we further develop an efficient far-field pattern prediction and synthesis algorithm for large-scale RIS design based on the antenna radiation superposition principle.

First, we prove the feasibility of Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction theory on a subwavelength scale. Based on this theory, the fully connected diffraction layer is constructed to build a high-resolution diffractive neural network (HR-DNN). Due to the capability of the diffraction layer in precisely manipulating subwavelength electromagnetic (EM) waves, high-resolution holographic imaging of complex patterns can be realized. In addition, a postprocessing method is particularly designed to separate clean target images from noisy holograms without reference assistance. The metrics, such as imaging efficiency (IE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM), are defined to estimate the imaging quality of the proposed HR-DNN-based holographic imaging system. Three types of complex patterns (airplane, phrase “WORLD PEACE 0921,” Olympic rings) are performed in the full-wave simulation, as well as the imaging results are highly recognizable with low-noise and uniform-intensity features. Compared with the weighted Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, the proposed HR-DNN gains significant improvements in IE (241.6%), PSNR (45.6%), and SSIM (44.0%). Finally, a metasurface with  $30\lambda \times 30\lambda $  based on 3-D printing technology is fabricated to image the Olympic rings.

In addition, the algorithm effectively integrates the focusing approach into the Newton method. With this contribution, the multiple scattering effect due to the whole investigation domain is suppressed, and thus, nonlinear and ill-posed nature of the problem is mitigated. Also, the algorithm eliminates the need for an accurate initial guess since it constructs the required initial guesses through the iterative process. Several numerical tests demonstrating the effectiveness of the focusing concept and the algorithm are conducted. It is shown that the proposed method provides successful reconstructions in which the conventional multi-incidence Newton solution fails.

A DCA far-field sampling strategy suitable for planar arrays is employed. Optimal log-linear DCA memory scaling is demonstrated. The performance of static MBF formulations is investigated, namely, the characteristic basis function method (CBFM) and windowed MBF (WMBF) schemes, which establish MBFs once as a preprocessing step. Static MBF approximation errors are difficult to control. Dynamic MBFs are iteratively refined to obtain a solution within user-specified error tolerance. Residual-driven (RD) CBFM, RD WMBFs, RD Krylov subspace MBFs, and block-Jacobi MBFs (both original and RD) are considered. Effective solution accuracy control is demonstrated. Runtime of all schemes is studied. Given optimal DCA acceleration, the results give a realistic view of relative efficiencies. Static MBFs are much less efficient than dynamic ones. Among dynamic schemes, RD static MBFs are less efficient. Krylov MBFs can perform better than the original block-Jacobi scheme, but the latter requires no parameter choice.

Since there are finite types of units, the various couplings among them, including the self and mutual ones, can be fully captured by analyzing characteristic subarrays. The technique first performs such analyses with low memory and CPU costs and stores the results in a database. The stored data are then used in assembling the system matrix of the overall metamaterial. Thanks to this, it is applicable to large-scale arrays without recourse to overall modeling and meshing. Furthermore, the technique significantly reduces the computational burden since only the inverse matrices of finite types of units are calculated during the iteration process of DDM. The effectiveness and accuracy of the technique are validated by realistic numerical examples.

A polarimetric MIMO radar consists of a large number of transmitting and receiving channels. The crosstalk and imbalance among the channels severely distort the measured PSM. In this article, a fully polarimetric calibration technique for a near-field MIMO imaging radar is proposed using a single passive calibrator named quarter concave cylinder linked dihedral (QCCLD) reflector which was presented in our previous work. The bistatic PSM of the QCCLD is derived based on physical optics (PO) approximation. For a QCCLD rotating around the line of sight (LOS) between the centers of the MIMO array and the calibrator, higher order scattering components are excited under bistatic transceiver antennas. Besides, a polarimetric calibration procedure for near-field MIMO imaging radar is developed. Utilizing Fourier analysis, three main scattering components (MSCs) of the QCCLD are extracted, while the undesirable scattering components which degrade the calibration accuracy are suppressed. Outdoor experiments are conducted using a polarimetric near-field MIMO imaging radar over 12–18 GHz frequency band. It is shown that after fully polarimetric calibration using the QCCLD, an improvement of more than 12 dB in polarization isolation is obtained, validating the proposed technique. Further analysis using polarimetric decomposition of the calibrated PSM images for both the Sandia laboratories implementation of cylinders (SLICY) benchmark target and a Volvo sport utility vehicle (SUV) demonstrate the usefulness in identifying scattering mechanisms.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3420436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10586861","Electromagnetic (EM) scattering;multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar;polarimetric calibration;polarimetric passive radar calibrator (PPRC);polarimetric scattering matrix (PSM);radar imagery","Calibration;Radar imaging;MIMO communication;Radar;Radar polarimetry;Radar cross-sections;MIMO radar","","2","","37","CCBYNCND","4 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Herein, via introducing propagation phase with constructive interference into geometric phase, full-space helicity-dependent decoupling relationship between amplitude and phase engineering based on single-pixeled meta-particle is derived, and the implementing mechanism of nonsinterleaved completely helicity-modulated cascaded metasurface (NCHCM) in full space is further elucidated.

Besides the models that rely on tabular data, Deep Learning (DL)-based image-driven models have also emerged. However, significant uncertainty is associated with path loss (PL) forecasting and deterministic ML predictions should be combined with a model for predictive uncertainty. As a result, we take a probabilistic approach by estimating prediction intervals using a deep probabilistic framework. The probabilistic framework attempts to address the issue of conditional bias, which frequently characterizes deterministic ML predictions obtained through error minimization. This is accomplished by quantifying uncertainty, making probabilistic predictions, and incorporating robust optimization techniques into the modeling process. The work at hand fuses images and tabular data into a deep probabilistic ensemble (DPE). More precisely, natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) is being used in order to obtain probabilistic predictions from each input modality separately. These unimodal predictions are then ensembled for each estimation point, according to the inverse of their variance. The proposed model’s results show a significant performance boost against the single-mode predictions in terms of prediction error and uncertainty.

However, the existing ALMs used to work with some predefined conditions, e.g., either incident polarization or operation bandwidth are limited, which prevents their implementation in wide practical applications. In this article, we present the design and measurement of a slab-type ALM, which is polarization-free and works in a couple of radar bands. This ALM is made by utilizing a full polarization compensation in 3-D, i.e., a multilayered structure with triangular constituents. The designed ALM possesses constitutive parameters identical to air in both X and Ku bands, adopting double Lorentz resonances. In the full-wave simulations, the ALM shows air-like scatteringless at around 8 and 13.5 GHz. In the experimental measurements, the ALM is nearly scatteringless in the same bands, with incident angles varying from 0° to 60° for both the vertical and horizontal polarizations. In-depth analysis shows that zero phase delay is introduced to the propagating waves, with the ALM being present. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to simultaneously break the polarization and bandwidth limitations of ALMs. The designed ALM would be a good candidate for facilitating superior antenna radomes, EM windows, as well as through-wall detections and communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3464859","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62122068,62071420,62471435,62271439); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (ZJNSF)(grant numbers:LR21F010002,LZ24F010002); Project Supported by Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10696924","Air-like transparency;dual-band;Lorentz dispersion;polarization compensation;polarization-free","Permittivity;Resonators;Dual band;Dielectrics;Slabs;Three-dimensional displays;Resonant frequency;Reflection;Metamaterials;Electromagnetics","","1","","37","IEEE","26 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rectangular iris on a metal wall inside a waveguide can be seen as a shunt LC resonant circuit, which can produce a resonance, called the resonant-iris mode. By cascading multiple layers of metallic walls with resonant iris, a bandpass filtering response can be achieved. A filtering antenna can be realized when the resonant iris on the top layer of the metallic wall is reused as the radiating slot. The coupling strength is easily controlled by modifying the distance between the adjacent resonant irises. Larger coupling strength can be obtained by reducing the distance between the two resonant irises, thus obtaining a wider bandwidth as well as a lower profile. For verification, second-order and fourth-order filtering antennas using the resonant-iris mode are designed, analyzed, and simulated. A prototype of the fourth-order filtering antenna is fabricated, and the experimental results show that it can achieve 70% bandwidth with good filtering performance and stable radiation pattern.

Additionally, to maintain consistent subarray geometry across various scanning beams, collective excitation difference vectors (CEDVs) and their energy bounds are introduced for each pair of adjacent subarray-level excitations. Consequently, the common subarray geometry required for generating multiple patterns can be determined by minimizing the number of CEDVs under multiple constraints. Three illustrative examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3439654","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U2341208); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0207500); Municipal Government of Quzhou(grant numbers:2023D010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10634128","Alternating total variation norm optimization (ATVNO);maximum subarray count;subarrayed arrays","Vectors;Geometry;Optimization;Phased arrays;Radio frequency;Radar antennas;Dictionaries","","","","24","IEEE","12 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this communication, a multidimensional feature metric-based (MFM) cluster-tracking algorithm is proposed. First, the multidimensional features (including centroid, shape, and density features) are extracted to describe the characteristics of clusters, in which the feature similarity is calculated to find the optimal matching relationship between different clusters in successive snapshots. Second, the feature similarity threshold is defined to distinguish the birth and death behaviors of dynamic clusters. In addition, a novel clustering validation index is proposed to evaluate the accuracy of clustering tracking results in time-varying channels. Finally, the measured and simulated channels at 28 GHz are used to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm can accurately capture the nonstationary time-varying properties in millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels, which is of great significance for the fifth-generation (5G) and the sixth-generation (6G) channel modeling.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3451955","National Natural Science of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62271201,62401205); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2023JC003); National Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environment(grant numbers:202101004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10666996","Cluster;multidimensional feature;time-varying channel;validation index","Clustering algorithms;Trajectory;Heuristic algorithms;Indexes;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Time-varying channels","","1","","21","IEEE","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This structure enables effective suppression of both types of scattering. Simulation results show that the proposed absorber achieves a monostatic radar cross section (RCS) reduction of more than −10 dB at normal incidence within the frequency range of 2–10 GHz. In addition, the first traveling wave lobe is reduced by more than 10 dB for TM polarization at grazing incidence.
