All previous works utilized feed lines to generate filtering radiation, yet they have struggled with low efficiencies, not exceeding 90%. This article introduces a novel method to achieve high efficiency in an ME-dipole filtenna by modifying the magnetic dipole without modifying the feed line and the electric dipole, which has not been utilized for this purpose. The modified magnetic dipole is loaded with numerous free-form parasitic patches to manipulate the equivalent magnetic currents and suppress stopband radiation. However, the complexity of tuning the structural parameters of these patches necessitates an automated approach. To address this, we propose an automatic co-simulation-optimization platform (ACSOP) incorporating the gray wolf optimizer (GWO). This platform automates the development of filtering antennas (filtennas), eliminating the need for prior knowledge of filtering principles. Our proposed ME-dipole filtenna achieves a high efficiency of 93%.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3453417","Donation for Research Projects_RMGS(grant numbers:9229014); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62401101); Municipal Government of Quzhou(grant numbers:2023D010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10675319","Filtering antenna (filtenna);free form;gray wolf optimizer (GWO);magnetic current;magnetoelectric dipole (ME-dipole)","Filtering;Magnetic separation;Dipole antennas;Antenna feeds;Magnetoelectric effects;Broadband antennas;Magnetic resonance","","1","","37","IEEE","10 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, imperfect filtering structures are prone to generate radiation leakages toward nonboresight directions at the stopband, resulting in degraded filtering characteristics in the peak realized gain response. This article introduces two new CP filtering antennas operating at 60 GHz: one involves a single antenna element and the other involves a folded reflectarray antenna (FRA), both presenting an outstanding peak realized gain filtering response. A unique folded double-layer substrate-integrated-waveguide (SIW) feeding structure incorporated with a self-energy-bounding CP radiator is proposed for the antenna element. No filtering structure is needed in the radiator. The feeding structure, independent of the resonator cavity, inherently minimizes radiation leakages and can produce three radiation nulls, guaranteeing the desired filtering characteristic. The proposed CP filtering antenna element is then integrated with a folded metasurface to create a new CP filtering FRA. Both antennas feature high selectivity, ample stopband rejection, stable CP radiation in upper millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies, and easy integration, making them suitable for 60-GHz communications and sensing systems applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3470233","Donation for Research Projects through the Research Matching Grant Scheme(grant numbers:9229014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10705955","60-GHz band;circular polarized (CP);filtering antenna;folded reflectarray;substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW)","Filtering;Antennas;Substrates;Antenna feeds;Reflector antennas;Couplings;Resonators;Slot antennas;Insertion loss;Radar antennas","","3","","40","IEEE","4 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work addresses this issue by presenting a novel self-decoupled patch array with each antenna consisting of two differentially fed patches. Two characteristic modes can be stimulated, with modal currents superimposing in one antenna but canceling each other out in the other. Meanwhile, their modal patterns remain directed at the broadside and are not distorted, thus ensuring that each antenna in the array has a consistent radiation pattern without the need for extra EM structures. In addition, an H-shaped structure is included to enable a band-stop filter to prevent capacitive coupling across patches, hence improving self-decoupling performance. Importantly, the presented self-decoupling approach is scalable for MIMO arrays, including two, four, or even more antennas, without any modifications to antenna design or sacrificing its radiation and decoupling characteristics. Finally, a four-element, self-decoupled MIMO patch array was designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured results exhibit that the coupling between adjacent and non-adjacent antennas is less than −35 and −38 dB over their operation band of 5.8–5.97 GHz, respectively. Each antenna features a consistent and undistorted radiation pattern with a peak gain of more than 7 dBi at the broadside.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3410535","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101604); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022A1515011314); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20220530145211026,GJHZ20220913142601002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10555450","Characteristic mode analysis (CMA);consistent radiation pattern;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) patch array;self-decoupling","Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays;Couplings;MIMO communication;Mutual coupling;Antennas;Antenna measurements","","2","","41","IEEE","12 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna is composed of dielectric units with varying lengths, engineered to facilitate the conversion of linearly polarized electromagnetic waves into circularly polarized waves. A rigorous theoretical analysis of these dielectric units reveals their ability to achieve a 90° phase difference between the two orthogonal electrical components within a substantial bandwidth. Subsequent empirical measurements corroborate these findings, affirming the antenna’s capacity to deliver a prominently wide axial ratio (AR) bandwidth. To achieve circular polarization (CP) and enhancement on gain, the design culminates in the construction of a convex lens, formed using these dielectric units. The proposed antenna demonstrates a remarkable impedance bandwidth spanning from 21.7 to 67 GHz, where the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) remains consistently below 2. In addition, the AR bandwidth is over 115.9% from 18 to 67 GHz, ensuring AR below 3 dB. The measured peak gain of the antenna registers at 20.6 dBic. This study extensively explores the intricate relationship between the relative dielectric constant and the dielectric unit.

Such functionality of independent real-time control for dual-CP beam is enabled by combining the merits of the Berry phase technique (BPT), dynamic phase technique (DPT), and reconfigurable technique. Based on the theory that an arbitrary linear polarized (LP) wave can be decomposed into a left-handed CP (LHCP) wave and a right-handed CP (RHCP) wave, the proposed array adopts the LP element to generate two independent switchable CP beams. A digital phase shifting network, comprising a switchable multiport phase shifter and two adjustable microstrip line phase shifters, is developed to provide the independent phase control for two orthogonal CP waves. To validate the concept, a  $1\times 8$  PAA operating at 4.3 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured. The experimental results agree well with the simulated ones for the six different beam states, thus verifying that the wavefront of the two orthogonal CP waves can be manipulated independently. The joint bandwidth of the 3-dB axial ratio (AR) and the 3-dB gain for all operating states can achieve 18.6%, covering from 3.9 to 4.7 GHz. The proposed dual-CP dual-beam PAA with independent and dynamic controllability could be applied in satellite communications, point-to-multipoint communications, and so on.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3468731","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201190,62071408,62401191); Anhui Province Science and Technology Innovation Project(grant numbers:202423i08050029); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JZ2023HGTB0272); State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves(grant numbers:K202401); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR, China(grant numbers:CityU 11215522); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10704588","Berry phase;circularly polarized (CP);dual beam;dynamic phase;pattern reconfigurable;phased array","Phased arrays;Phase shifters;Switches;P-i-n diodes;Regulation;Controllability;Bandwidth;Switching circuits;Berry phase;Phase control","","3","","40","IEEE","3 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Planar Near-Field Antenna Measurements With a Uniform Step Larger Than Half-Wavelength","R. Moretta; G. Petraglia; F. Pascariello; M. Feo; M. A. Maisto","Department of Engineering, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Aversa, Italy; RF Technology Department, MBDA Italy, Bacoli, Italy; RF Technology Department, MBDA Italy, Bacoli, Italy; RF Technology Department, MBDA Italy, Bacoli, Italy; Department of Engineering, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Aversa, Italy",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"19 Dec 2024","2024","72","12","9012","9023","In this article, a new sampling scheme of the near field radiated by a planar source is proposed and assessed. More in detail, this article shows a uniform sampling criterion that allows representing the near field over a plane with a number of measurements lower than the classical half-wavelength sampling. First, a discretization strategy of the near field based on the warping method is recalled from the literature. In the region of the observation domain located in front of the source, the warping sampling scheme employs a nonredundant number of measurements since it predicts the exact positions where the near-field samples must be collected. On the contrary, in the region of the measurement plane beyond the source, it does not return the exact positions of the field samples. For such a reason, a spatially varying oversampling can be used to avoid loss of information in the discretization process and maintain the number of field samples as low as possible. Despite that the warping method represents the state of the art in terms of the number of measurements, it requires acquiring the near field samples over a nonuniform grid. To overcome this drawback, in this article, the spatially varying oversampling is chosen in such a way that the resulting sampling becomes uniform. Such choice still ensures a growth of the sampling rate only at the edges of the observation domain permitting the retrieval of the near field by its samples with fewer measurements than the half-wavelength sampling. Finally, numerical simulations based on synthetic and experimental data corroborate the effectiveness of the approach in recovering both the near field and the far field.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3466471","European Union and in part by Italian Ministry of University and Research through PRIN2022-PNRR Project NIMAERIA(grant numbers:P2022PS843); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10700676","Antenna measurements;near-field sampling;singular values decomposition;warping","Antenna measurements;Antenna radiation patterns;Size measurement;Shape measurement;Position measurement;Geometry;Frequency measurement;Standards;Sensors;Particle measurements","","1","","44","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As opposed to the traditional gain extrapolation technique, where higher order scattering is purposely ignored, so as to isolate only the direct antenna-to-antenna coupling, we show that by incorporating third-order scattering, the enhanced gain extrapolation technique can be obtained. The theoretical foundation using third-order scattering is developed, and experimental results are presented comparing the enhanced technique and traditional technique for two sets of internationally recognized NIST reference standard gain horn antennas at the X band and the Ku band. We show that with the enhanced technique, gain values for these antennas are readily obtained to within stated uncertainties of ±0.07 dB using as few as ten data points per antenna pair, as opposed to ≈4000–8000 data points per antenna pair that is needed with the traditional technique.

Furthermore, the model is exploited to analyze the radiation performance of multiferroic antennas according to acoustic resonator topologies (FBAR and SMR) and excitation modes (thickness-extensional (TE) and thickness-shear (TS) modes). The analysis reveals that SMR-based antennas radiate less than FBAR-based ones due to substrate energy loss. In addition, antennas excited by TE modes can generate significantly more power than those excited by TS modes. Finally, we investigate the frequency-dependent mechanical and electrical limitations of radiation at GHz frequencies by comparing the efficiency-bandwidth products of different multiferroic antennas with Chu’s limit in the Akhiezer regime.

An equivalent analytical equation for the radiation performance of a general circularly polarized (CP) antenna loaded with the conformal TPS is presented. Compared with planar TPS, conformal TPS leads to more complicated impacts on the antenna’s radiation performance, mainly manifested by main lobe splitting, gain reduction, and axial ratio (AR) deterioration. The extent of this effect is related to the curvature radius of the conformal TPS. A method to design a nonuniform impedance ground (IG) replacing the PEC ground to repair the degradation of the radiation performance by the conformal TPS is proposed. A broadband Archimedean spiral antenna loaded with a conformal TPS and a nonuniform IG is fabricated and measured to verify the proposed theoretical method. According to the simulation and measurement results, the antenna has an AR of less than 3 dB from 3 to 12 GHz and an AR beamwidth of 60° on average by loading the nonuniform IG. The main lobe splitting at 4 GHz is repaired, and the gain is improved by ~2.5 dB.

The averaged DMD further decomposes the received signal into eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. The frequency information is derived from the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors represent the steering vectors of sources. Subsequently, mutual coupling is informed into the calibration of the steering vector for each source. Specifically, the calibration of corresponding eigenvectors leverages the inverse of the mutual coupling matrix, i.e., Toeplitz matrix, acquired through Schur decomposition. Then, the calibrated steering vectors facilitate the estimation of angles. The decomposition results of our proposed method reveal a significant one-to-one correspondence between eigenvectors and eigenvalues, enabling automatic pairing of estimated frequencies and angles.

Open apertures are utilized as magnetic boundaries to truncate this photonic crystal (PC) into a finite size of two-column unit cells for antenna design. This truncated PC serves as a zero-phase shift line with impedance matching to its feed line. Waves traveling along this zero-phase shift line are fast waves, capable of radiating broadside beams to function as a leaky wave antenna with two symmetrical beams. As an example, a leaky wave antenna with a length of  $5.1\lambda _{0}$  ( $\lambda _{0}$  is the wavelength in free space at 12 GHz) is designed to verify the proposed truncated PC.

The BLRFC has been used to manipulate transmissive electromagnetic (EM) waves by loading control circuits between the grounds of two antenna arrays. Based on the proposed A/PMMS, the amplitude and phase of EM waves can be manipulated independently. The phase manipulation is realized by tuning the length of the transmission line. Also, the amplitude manipulation is realized by tuning the characteristic impedance of the transmission line to change the match between the circuit and the antennas. Furthermore, a wideband metalens antenna with sidelobe suppression is designed, fabricated, and measured based on the proposed scheme. The sidelobe suppression is achieved by tuning the amplitude distribution of the metalens aperture to realize the Taylor distribution. Measurements show that the proposed metalens antenna achieves the 3-dB gain-bandwidth of 35.8% (8–11.5 GHz). At 9 GHz, the first and the second sidelobe levels (SLLs) in the E- and H-planes are suppressed lower than -30 dB, and the realized gain is 23.6 dBi. The measured performance verifies the flexibility and the superiority of the novel scheme. In addition, the proposed scheme can be easily extended to the dual-polarized design. By using dual-polarized antennas, and loading circuits on the channel of each polarization, a dual-polarized A/PMMS is designed.

This article is the first to utilize machine learning (ML) to predict EMF exposure levels for the clothed human body at 20–100 GHz, including temperature rises and absorbed power density (APD) at the exposed skin surface. To predict the EMF exposure, a reconfigurable architecture neural network with weight analysis (RAWA-NN) framework is proposed. This framework is based on the deep neural network (DNN) integrating the proposed weights-analyzer module and optimization module. The proposed novel framework streamlines the training process and reduces training time, while simultaneously adaptively optimizes the hyperparameters (hidden layers and hidden sizes) without the necessity for manual intervention during training and optimization. The model was trained using 70% of forearm data, with the remaining data for testing. Data from other body parts, such as the abdomen and quadriceps, was used to validate the model generalization. Compared to conventional dosimetry analysis, relative difference (RD) across various parameters remains below 2.6% across various parameters, for the same body part of the forearm, and below 9.5% for other body parts.

Compared with the previous work of the DGTD-GSTC method from the authors, this article takes the normal component of SP into account for the first time. These normal components play an important role in the accurate simulation of metasurfaces under oblique incidence at the expense of extra numerical simulation difficulty. To equip the normal SP in the DGTD method, we rigorously derive the new numerical flux with normal SP and propose the corresponding time integration scheme based on the explicit Runge-Kutta method. Numerical examples including the ideal model, the periodic array, and the curved metasurface are given. The results are compared with analytical results or commercial simulation software. The comparisons show that the proposed method can accurately obtain the macroscopic response of the metasurfaces.

A general metasurface, in general, requires a boundary condition of infinite-order spatial derivatives to accurately model the surface, making them unsuitable for conventional full-wave modeling techniques where higher-order derivatives are computed numerically. Here, we propose a mixed spatial-spectral-domain representation of the boundary conditions that avoid the explicit computation of higher-order derivatives while still being in a form suitable for integration into standard numerical methods.

Multidesign parameter and multiobjective EM problems are common in engineering practice. As the problem design dimensionality increases, the training time of the surrogate model in the optimization process becomes nonnegligible. The performance of optimization algorithms degrades for high design dimensions and multiple objectives, and many full-wave simulation calculations are required before convergence. In this work, an incremental variable-fidelity machine-learning-assisted hybrid optimization (IVF-MLAHO) algorithm is proposed to solve a multiobjective EM problem with medium-scale (i.e., 20–50) design variables. First, reliable variable-fidelity models are used for initial sampling to reduce the computational cost of sampling. Then, in the training process, incremental learning or retraining is adaptively selected to update the surrogate models, which reduces the training burden. Furthermore, a hybrid global multiobjective and local single-objective optimization algorithm is adopted to markedly improve the convergence performance. Finally, the superiority of the IVF-MLAHO algorithm is verified on a substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) broadband millimeter-wave slot antenna array, in which the training time is greatly reduced.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3481663","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271133,62371120); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10729733","Antenna design;incremental learning;machine learning;multiobjective optimization;variable-fidelity optimization","Computational modeling;Optimization;Training;Predictive models;Data models;Antennas and propagation;Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Antenna arrays;Millimeter wave technology","","","","25","IEEE","22 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electrostatic and magnetostatic solutions are used to approximate the solutions in the slow-time-varying limit. Field tests are performed and analyzed to assess the accuracy of the LWNFS model using measurements of very-low-frequency (VLF) transmitter signals scattered by electrically small metallic boxes with different shapes. Because the amplitudes of the VLF transmitter signals can vary over time, a validation technique using normalized field values is employed: measurements are interpreted using the normalized Stokes parameters of the VLF transmitter signals. Excellent agreement between experimental observations and the predictions of the LWNFS model is demonstrated for a variety of cases.

To accomplish this, a circuit modeling technique called the impedance expansion method (IEM) is extended to consider lossy dielectrics with a loss tangent greater than unity. Unlike the conventional IEM, the extended method first expands the coefficient matrices derived by the method of moments (MoM) into the Laurent series with respect to propagation constants and then further expands them with respect to the complex angular frequency. Based on this feature, the extended method is called the impedance double expansion method (IDEM). By applying the IDEM to the undersea dipole and loop antennas with pure water covers, their circuit models are obtained. Comparison with the full-wave MoM and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations shows that these circuit models reasonably approximate not only the reflection and transmission coefficients between the antennas with matching circuits (MCs) but also the radiation loss.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3485793","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (JSPS KAKENHI)(grant numbers:19K04321,23K03812); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10739956","Dielectric losses;equivalent circuits;method of moments (MoM);wireless power transmission","Dielectric losses;Integrated circuit modeling;Impedance;Antennas;Dipole antennas;Propagation losses;Loop antennas;Eddy currents;Antenna radiation patterns;Method of moments","","1","","37","CCBYNCND","30 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, the first-order Born approximation (BA) is limited to cases where the contrast between the scatterer and the background medium is exceptionally low. While higher-order terms in the Born series can be used for higher contrasts, convergence issues may arise due to highly oscillatory factors in Green’s function. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a physics-based DL method inspired by the Born series, which effectively predicts the distribution of the complex electromagnetic field. The proposed series assures convergence when scattering occurs from high-contrast objects, due to the use of a learning-based forward operator. Exploiting the physics-based nature of our model, we adopt a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, requiring significantly fewer training data. Our results demonstrate very good generalization capabilities of the proposed approach, showcasing its ability to handle unseen background fields and profiles.

However, available multifunctional vortex wave generators are often constrained by dispersion effects, limiting their operation to only a few frequency points or within narrowband. In this article, a method for generating dual-mode OAM vortex waves under broadband conditions is proposed. Initially, by employing the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase concept, 360° coverage of the reflective phase can be achieved on a single dielectric substrate. Subsequently, to address the reduced purity of OAM modes caused by metasurface dispersion under broadband conditions, a distance inversion method is proposed. A prototype is designed, manufactured, and measured to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Both simulated and measured results confirm that the metasurface can generate OAM beams with  $l \,\, = \,\, -1$  and  $l \,\, = \,\, +2$  within a bandwidth from 8 to 14 GHz (54.55% relative bandwidth). Across this frequency range, the measured OAM purities for  $l \,\, = \,\, -1$  and  $l \,\, = \,\, +2$  exceed 86% and 82%, respectively. The proposed metasurface exhibits potential application in high-capacity multiplexed wireless communication systems. Furthermore, the distance inversion method can mitigate the effects of metasurface dispersion and shows promise for broadband metasurface design, as well as wavefront manipulation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3470229","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:CCNU22JC018); Key Research and Development Project of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2023BAB061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10705941","Metasurface;orbital angular momentum (OAM);Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase;vortex beam","Metasurfaces;Dispersion;Reflection;Broadband communication;Broadband antennas;Bandwidth;Reflection coefficient;Wideband;Antennas and propagation;Wireless communication","","","","50","IEEE","4 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the magnetized plasma, VEMW is reflected at the cut-off height of each mode, and standing waves occur when the propagation is stable. The vortex state is distorted mainly near the center point, which is particularly serious in the extraordinary wave propagation region. In addition, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) density in magnetized plasma is no longer conserved as in vacuum, and there is a value of OAM density near the center point, which may be related to the collective motion of electrons. Due to the nonlinear interaction between VEMW and plasma, the plasma also presents a vortex state.

First, the impact mechanism of the human body on MRC port impedance is analyzed in this article under the inductive near-field based on the dielectric dispersion of human tissues. This mechanism helps identify the quasistatic magnetic field within MRC, from which the resonance conditions of MRC are derived. A reconfigurable impedance matching method within a broad bandwidth is proposed using these conditions, and experiments on port impedance and transmission characteristics are conducted using an optimized variable parameter coil as the implementation medium. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can precisely tune within a range of 10 MHz under inductive near-field, confirming the reliability of the resonance conditions and matching methodology. After matching, the MRC exhibits only 12.5 dB at 13.56 MHz path loss over a 90 cm transmission distance, surpassing other methods by more than 52.8%.

Conventional feeding networks for OAM antennas rely on varying transmission line lengths realizing phase shift, which struggles to maintain high mode purity over a wide bandwidth. Therefore, an innovative feeding network scheme is proposed, utilizing a wideband 90° cascaded hybrid coupler and reversible feeding direction of the microstrip-to-slot transition, achieving wideband 90° and 180° phase shifts, respectively, then ensuring wideband high mode purity. Then, ±1 and ±2 mode OAM antennas are designed, where the proposed feeding network excites a lens-loaded uniform circular array (UCA). To ensure high E-field rotational symmetry and thus high OAM mode purity, the aperture of the ±1 mode UCA is shaped by loading an overmoded circular waveguide with notches. Measurement shows that the proposed OAM antennas support two simultaneous modes, with mode purity exceeding 90% and divergence angles of about ±4°/±6° from 25 to 28 GHz (11.3%).

The measured outcome demonstrates that the suggested omnidirectional polarization-diversity DRA exhibits strong performance, which can achieve a 25 dB minimum isolation and a 4.2 dBi maximum gain within a 12% overlapping bandwidth. Significantly, it necessitates a DR height of only  $0.08\lambda _{\text {o}}$ , a new record for the omnidirectional polarization-diversity DRAs. The proposed DRA can be applied to the WLAN-5.8 GHz (5.725–5.85 GHz), ISM-5.8 GHz (5.725–5.875 GHz), V2X-band (5.905–5.925 GHz), and Wi-Fi 6E (5.925–6.125 GHz).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3491355","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701292); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Foundation(grant numbers:2022A1515010248); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750251","Bandwidth-enhanced;dielectric resonator antenna (DRA);low-profile;omnidirectional;polarization-diversity","Bandwidth;Resonant frequency;Reflection coefficient;Probes;Impedance;Dielectric resonator antennas;Dipole antennas;Dielectric constant;Resonance;Aperture antennas","","1","","28","IEEE","11 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The employed spectral domain formulation is based on the steepest descent path (SDP) method of integration and utilizes a nonuniform phase center choice to improve the estimation of the first-order saddle point. In turn, the radiative near field is asymptotically evaluated by accounting for the interactions between the leaky wave (LW) poles and the saddle point. Good agreement is obtained with full-wave simulations both for LW feeds excited by electric (dipole) and magnetic (slot) current sources. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, the radiative near field is combined with Physical Optics (PO) to examine a small elliptical lens integrated with a double-slot LW feed. A physical interpretation is provided for the increased efficiency of small integrated elliptical lenses, based on the wave nature of the radiative near field in resonant LWAs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3481650","Onassis Foundation through Scholarship(grant numbers:FZR040-1/2021-2022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10729718","High-frequency techniques;leaky wave antennas (LWAs);lens antennas;phase center;radiative near field","Lenses;Surface waves;Solids;Optical surface waves;Leaky wave antennas;Feeds;Estimation;Dispersion;Dielectrics;Voltage","","","","28","IEEE","22 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design utilizes a full-metal long slot as its radiation structure to simultaneously achieve wideband and low-loss performance. To ensure low gain fluctuation across a wideband, wide-angle scanning range, an innovative structure incorporating two pins and grooves is implemented outside the ridges. This design facilitates a promising gain enhancement mechanism for wide-angle scanning, which is explored through the analysis of the field distribution of the element with periodic boundaries. The ridge gap waveguide (RGW) technology is employed to feed the elements, offering a wide single-mode bandwidth, reduced loss, and compact physical width. To validate the design, a  $1\times 16$  array prototype with two distinct feeding networks was constructed to achieve radiation both at the broadside and 60°. The measured VSWR for both radiation states remains under two across almost the entire band, confirming the array’s wideband, wide-angle scanning capabilities. The measured and simulated radiation results show a good agreement from 20 to 30 GHz, showcasing a peak gain of 19.2 dBi and maintaining a gain fluctuation under 2.5 dB within a ±60° scanning range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3480273","Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2024GH-ZDXM-43,2024GH-ZDXM-11); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401339); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10726716","Low gain fluctuation;ridge gap waveguide (RGW);slot elements;wide-angle scanning;wideband phased array","Gain;Wideband;Metals;Fluctuations;Phased arrays;Pins;Antennas and propagation;Apertures;Loss measurement;Beam steering","","","","33","IEEE","21 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the integration of electric field enhancement structure (EFES) and RASs has been proven to improve the sensitivity and the minimal detectable electric field of RAS, there are concerns regarding their omnidirectional and polarization performance. However, most existing RASs or RASs loaded with EFES operate with linear polarization, which reduces the sensitivity to circularly polarized (CP) microwave reception. It is a challenging method to change the property of the lasers to modify the RAS’s CP property, while it is simpler to use EFES to change RASs’ polarization indirectly. Meanwhile, current EFES research mainly focuses on the response of electric field enhancement at a fixed incident angle, limiting extension to 3-D CP patterns and lacking clear physical insights to guide. To address this, we propose an RAS with CP EFES to achieve CP reception capability. The EFES converts spatial CP electric field into local linearly polarized (LP) electric field, adjusting the RAS characteristics accordingly. We use characteristics mode (CM) methods, dividing the problem into modal current, governing the modal patterns, and external CP excitation sources, determining the coefficients of each modal pattern. This method reduces the complexity of the pattern analysis and improves the efficiency of optimization design. To validate the proposed method’s efficiency, we fabricate a prototype to measure reception pattern and further study the CP performance using an atomic heterodyne approach. The results indicate that the RAS with EFES achieves the right-hand CP (RHCP) omnidirectional reception capability, and the sensitivity is improved by 19.2 dB at 2.195 GHz. The cross-polarized level can be further improved to 24.5 dB using an atomic heterodyne approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3452960","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901495); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901495); Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2022JJ40556); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10670032","Characteristic mode (CM);circularly polarized (CP);polarization converter;Rydberg atom","Electric fields;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave measurement;Masers;Microwave antennas;Atomic measurements;Microwave amplifiers","","1","","25","IEEE","9 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is well known that the conventional Butler matrix is bulky as the beamformer occupies most area of the multibeam array. In this work, the miniaturization of the Butler matrix is realized by loading slow wave (SW) structures in the form of loaded patches and non-inclusive via-holes into substrate integrated waveguide (SIW). In this manner, the effective permittivity and permeability of the SIW are increased. Consequently, both the guided wavelength and the cut-off frequency of the SIW are largely reduced. This SW-SIW technology enables the designs of miniaturized couplers, crossovers, and phase shifters with substantially reduced longitudinal and lateral dimensions. With these miniaturized components, a Butler matrix with excellent performance is developed, which is 75.5% smaller compared with the conventional SIW-based Butler matrix. The miniaturized  $4\times 4$  Butler matrix is then employed to design a compact four-beam slot antenna array. The measured results agree reasonably well with the simulations, demonstrating the feasibility of the miniaturized SW-SIW Butler matrix in designing a compact multibeam antenna array.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3463203","National Natural Science Foundation of China for Outstanding Young Scholars(grant numbers:62022064); Proof of Concept Foundation of Xidian University Hangzhou Institute of Technology(grant numbers:GNYZ2023XJ0204); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, SAR, China(grant numbers:62022064,GNYZ2023XJ0204); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10693320","Butler matrix;miniaturization;multibeam antenna array;slow wave (SW);substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)","Couplers;Butler matrices;Substrates;Couplings;Phase shifters;Propagation constant;Scattering parameters","","1","","22","IEEE","24 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
