To address these issues, we propose a novel strategy featuring the integration of temporal interference (TI) into a wireless power transfer (WPT) model, thereby creating a TI magnetically coupled resonant (MCR) differential frequency WPT approach. We further designed an implantable flexible passive VNS electrode using a serpentine interconnection structure. In this strategy, the flexible electrode serves a dual role as both a differential frequency WPT receiver coil and a VNS electrode. The control of the WPT system parameters allows for a corresponding low-frequency envelope alternating current to be coupled within the flexible electrode. This enables electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve at varying frequencies and intensities. We validate our proposed model using numerical calculations and experiments. Flexible electrodes were tested in three environments with different impedance parameters: air, tissue-simulating liquid, and fresh pork. When the electrode inside fresh pork was put in the middle of two transmitting coils and 10-cm away from the transmitting coil, the minimum induced current in the electrode made it to 3.35 mA. The results affirm the effectiveness of the TI MCR differential frequency WPT model paired with passive flexible electrodes for VNS. This new strategy could potentially advance the development of vagus nerve modulation technology.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3434370","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52107236,52320105008); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFC2402203); Colleges and Universities in Hebei Province Science and Technology Research Project(grant numbers:QN2021043); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10620396","Implant devices;passive flexible electrodes;temporal interference (TI);vagus nerve stimulation (VNS);wireless power transfer (WPT)","Electrodes;Coils;Magnetic fields;Interference;Magnetic resonance;Electric fields;Wireless power transfer","","2","","35","IEEE","1 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Three simultaneous excitation modes with the same amplitude and different phase relationships are utilized to analyze the decoupling problem. In the perspective of simultaneous excitations, the decoupling of the three antenans can be transformed into active impedance matching. Theoretical demonstration reveals that achieving decoupling for axial symmetrical three antennas necessitates matching the active impedances under the three excitations. The active impedance matching can be solved intuitively in a clear step-by-step process by exploiting the impedance characteristics of the coupled three-line and the unique field distribution under different excitation modes. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the decoupling of axial symmetric three inverted-F antennas (IFAs) is presented as an example. The achieved isolation exceeds 17 dB in the desired band with a peak isolation of 31 dB.

The investigation reveals that when the excited microstrip-fed slot antenna is operating at an anti-TE20 mode, the coupled microstrip-fed slot antenna undergoes a mode conversion to a TE20 mode due to the boundary conditions of the slot. As a result, the pair of slot antennas achieves high self-decoupling.

Here, we use direct antenna amplitude modulation (DAAM) to enhance the modulation rate of the proposed magnetoelectric (ME) antenna. First, we construct a nonlinear converse ME (CME) equivalent circuit model to optimize the dc magnetic field and operating frequency. The relaxation of Young’s modulus of the magnetic layer is gradually eliminated with the increase of modulation rate until Young’s modulus and radiation intensity of the ME antenna are no longer changed. Ideally, the modulation rate of DAAM is half of the carrier rate, but the actual value is lower than the ideal value due to the overshoot and ringing from the modulation coil. Under the carrier frequency of 27.6 kHz and the modulation frequency of 6 kHz, the bit rate of DAAM reaches up to 12 kbps, which is six times higher than that of the conventional electrical modulation.

However, the available spaces are segmented into fragmented pieces by the electronic components inside the terminal. This article addresses the problem of how to utilize these fragmented spaces efficiently. A novel miniaturized wideband antenna strategy called distributed mobile antennas is proposed and the distributed two-element antennas are introduced. By assigning a 90° phase difference, the reflections looking toward these two antennas are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase, leading to reflection cancellation. Therefore, wideband matching can be achieved and the bandwidth can be further improved by introducing the degree of freedom of the element size consistency. When the proposed strategy is applied to a normal patch, the measured results show that the impedance bandwidths are improved by  $3.6\times $  and  $4.6\times $  for the identical and dissimilar patch cases, respectively. When applied to a miniaturized patch, the bandwidths are improved by  $6.0\times $  and  $6.9\times $ . Moreover, due to the dispersion of hotspots by distributed two-element antennas, the specific absorption rate (SAR) achieves great average reductions of 1.4–2.4 dB.

Unlike traditional models, this surrogate model does not accept design variables of the antenna as input but uses 2-D images depicting the antenna instead. Different pixel values in the images represent various antenna materials, and regions formed by identical pixel values denote the antenna’s geometric dimensions. Leveraging the powerful image processing capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this surrogate model can learn the relationship between the geometric parameters and material properties of the antenna and its performance. In addition, to further enhance the evaluation accuracy of the surrogate model, modifications are made to the traditional CNN, allowing the surrogate model to be decomposed into multiple parts for use.

Comprehensive analyses and comparisons are conducted regarding the resonant frequency shifts of dipole and loop FSSs under oblique incidence. The total equivalent impedance of the FSS is treated as the aggregate of equivalent impedances corresponding to numerous Floquet modes. A hierarchical relationship is established among the incident angle  $\boldsymbol {\theta }$ , wave vector (kx, ky), equivalent impedance  $Z_{eq}$ , and reflection coefficient  $S_{11}$ . The variation of the incident angle  $\boldsymbol {\theta }$  is observed to exert a discernible influence on the tangential wave vector, denoted as  $k_{0}\textit {sin}\theta $ . This influence subsequently instigates a modification in the equivalent impedance, ultimately resulting in a shift in the resonant frequency of the FSS.

To demonstrate an application, the SDOT is used to derive the radiative transport equation (RTE) in random media with large-scale fluctuations (LSFs). In particular, the parameter regime is established for RTE in random media with LSF. This was enabled by imposing two conditions. One is based on estimating the error involved in approximating the mass operator by its leading term. The second is based on the quasi-homogeneity requirement of the coherence function. By expanding the Wigner distribution as a perturbation series, it is found that the convergence of this series requires that the scale size of fluctuation is much smaller than the spatial range where radiative transport manifests.

It is shown that these meta-shells can be characterized by a singular potential. For Huygens’ MSs with magneto-electric coupling, the wave scattering is described by a four-parameter family of point interactions, derived previously within 1-D quantum mechanics. The singularity of the potential is utilized here to convert the boundary value problem into a volume integral equation. The resulting far-field pattern is expressed in the form of an impact parameter model, that is, as a true Fourier transform of the profile function. Then, a linear noniterative inversion algorithm, based on the ideas of microlocal analysis, is used to recover the support of the scattering potential, and therefore, the shape of the meta-shell. Scalar 2-D simulations of a TM-polarized wave, normally incident on (a cluster of) cylindrical meta-shells, confirm the validity of the method. Under some conditions, direct analysis of the signatures, appearing in the reconstructed tomograms, allows one to identify the type of the interaction (electric/magnetic response, or magneto-electric coupling). In fact, the meta-shell model turns out to be much more general than could be initially imagined, since it describes also all physically meaningful impenetrable objects, including perfectly conducting (Dirichlet/Neumann) and impedance-type scatterers.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3421928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10594742","Boundary conditions;metasurfaces (MSs);microwave imaging;shape recovery;wave scattering","Magnetic resonance imaging;Metasurfaces;Magnetoelectric effects;Boundary conditions;Surface waves;Shape;Mathematical models","","1","","28","IEEE","10 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, the evolution of the ED over range has been reported to cause further adverse effects on these technologies in some circumstances. However, in terms of the predictability of these effects, more research is still needed. This research explores ED variations over range and characterizes them based-on two numerical datasets from different latitudes, different hemispheres, and during different seasons as well as correlating their range distributions to distributions of other atmospheric variables. It is found, for both datasets, that most often a linear function accurately represents the variations of ED characteristics over ~60 km in range, but higher order functional distributions of ED characteristics with range do occur albeit less frequently. Furthermore, the range distributions of mean wind speed and mean specific humidity within the evaporation layer are strongly correlated to the range distributions of duct height; while range distributions of duct shape are mainly related to the specific humidity gradient in the evaporation layer. The midlatitude dataset exhibits more complex range distributions during frontal events, while the equatorial dataset shows the most complex range distributions near sunrise.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3424346","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-19-1-2350); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10599216","Dimensionality reduction;evaporation duct (ED);ED height;inhomogeneity;meteorological properties;radio wave propagation","Ducts;Evaporation;Sea measurements;Refractive index;Atmospheric modeling;Humidity;Ocean temperature","","","","42","CCBY","15 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

According to the status of diodes loaded in F-AMC, the reflection characteristics could be switched between electric and magnetic conductors. When field intensity is low, the diodes are off-state, and the reflection phase is about 180°, performing as an electric conductor; once the diodes are triggered into on-state by the high-intensity field, the reflection phase would switch to nearly 0° and perform as a magnetic conductor. Through nonperiodically arranging and optimizing the number of F-AMC unit cells on the reflector surface, the phase distribution of the wavefront would remain uniform in a low-intensity environment and be messed under HIRF. The messed phase of the wavefront could defocus the radiation beam and reduce the gain to prevent the high-intensity fields from being received. After simulation and measurement, the proposed reflector antenna was demonstrated to decrease its gain by more than 20 dB under HIRF.

First, the advantages of the conventional grid array antenna (GAA) in terms of miniaturization and closer multiresonances are demonstrated through comparison with a conventional microstrip patch antenna (MPA). Then, based on the analysis of these resonances in GAA, two evolution processes are implemented to improve the performance. On the one hand, the grid units are adjusted, i.e., the GAA turns into a nonuniform GAA (NUGAA). On the other hand, a coplanar L-probe and two pairs of short slots are integrated into the NUGAA. The former evolution makes the three resonance modes in GAA aligned, and thus the bandwidth is extended; meanwhile, this step introduces the radiation null (RN) at the lower operational band edge. The latter evolution generates the RN at the upper operational band-edge, which, together with the lower RN, leads to a skirt selectivity and preferable out-of-band rejection level; meanwhile, this step modifies the resonant mode in the higher band, and ensures a broadside radiation pattern with a consistent polarization. Finally, the optimized NUGAA with a compact size of  $0.45\times 0.28\times 0.055\lambda _{0}^{3}$  is fabricated and measured, demonstrating excellent agreement with the simulation results. The proposed design achieves a bandwidth of 3.08–3.71 GHz (18.8%) with more than 21.5 dB out-of-band suppression level.

The odd-mode slow wave unit composed of two “half-cross-shaped” units, creates longitudinal current distribution and omnidirectional radiation components, enabling full space scanning possible. The cut-off frequency and slope of odd-mode unit is independently controlled by manipulating the longest electric current path length and electric field strength between the spacing. In this LWA, by unifying the cut-off frequency and changing the slope of dispersion curve, the spacing length modulation is introduced herein instead of classical groove depth modulation, which fully utilizes unit slow wave property while realizing radiation, thus achieving high scanning rate.

The unit cells (UCs) of the proposed LWA are connected by microstrip PD lines, which allows for the excitation of different nth higher-order space harmonics, resulting in an n-beam radiation pattern. Notably, by appropriate design of the microstrip PD lines, a pair of phase constants with equal amplitude but reverse lateral directions can be created, which ensures that the radiation beam remains fixed in the lateral direction. Furthermore, the inclusion of microstrip PD lines provides phase compensation (PCs) for each UC. Computer simulations demonstrate that the microstrip PD lines significantly improve the realized gain of the LWA while reducing the operating bandwidth. Consequently, the scanning rates, i.e., scanning range divided by operating bandwidth, experience a remarkable increase.

Empirical formulas or coarse-meshed full-wave simulation (FS) are two widely adopted sources of LF data. However, the accuracy of the empirical formulas is too low to use in some cases and the coarse-meshed FS is still sensitive to computational costs. To mitigate these issues, a new multifidelity neural network (MFNN) and a new source of LF data are proposed to estimate the EM responses. First, the nonlinear coefficient between the low- and high-fidelity (HF) data is modeled by the neural network layers instead of the Gaussian process or polynomials for higher accuracy. Second, the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization property of the neural network is exploited, and the outputs of neural networks on OOD samples are regarded as low-fidelity (LF) data, which further get rid of the necessity to generate LF data by the FS with coarse-discretized mesh. The results from two metasurface cases demonstrate the enhanced accuracy of the proposed method when a specific amount of HF data is available, and about 30% reduction of required simulation to obtain a specific accuracy requirement.

To demonstrate various functionalities of the metasurfaces, the p-i-n-based metasurface reflector is used to demonstrate magnitude control, sidelobe level control, and binary amplitude grating to generate three symmetrical beams. The varactor-based metasurface reflector is used to demonstrate single beam-steering and binary phase grating to generate two symmetrical beams.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3428729","Minist?re de la D?fense Nationale; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10606186","Beamforming;binary grating;metasurface reflector;p-i-n diode;resonance;side-lobe level (SLL) reduction;varactor diode","Metasurfaces;Varactors;PIN photodiodes;Computer architecture;Resonators;Microprocessors;Resonance","","7","","15","IEEE","22 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
