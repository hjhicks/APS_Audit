The need for connectivity has been further spanned by new ways of handling and organizing information, within the framework of the Internet of Things and the evolution towards proactive and predictive environments, such as those foreseen in Cognitive cities. This evolution has led to the need of ever increasingly demanding key performance indicators of wireless communication devices and systems of current 5G and future 6G networks, with transmission rates in the Tbps range, latencies of  $100~\mu $ s, reliability values of 99.99999%, or device densities of  $10^{7}$  devices/km2, among others. These requirements pose relevant challenges in different domains, which in turn has catalyzed research efforts to meet these stringent demands related with devices, channel and system design and development. In this way, new antenna concepts are proposed, propagation analysis and measurement techniques are explored, and new application scenarios and domains are envisaged. With the emergence of high frequency ranges, large antenna arrays, and metasurfaces for communication systems, the near field boundary definition is becoming increasingly important. As a result of high path losses at mmWave and THz frequencies, the 6G communication systems are anticipated to operate mostly in the near field, where a plane wave approximation can result in a significant phase error during beam steering. This simple conclusion has resulted in re-evaluation of many antenna design principles that were taken for granted during the era of small antenna apertures and sub-6 GHz propagation. This is particularly visible through the analysis of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which are considered in [1]. RIS apertures are large w.r.t. operational frequency and they are expected to operate predominantly in near field, which necessitates the generation of near field codebooks and imaging patterns. The performance of RIS metasurfaces in near field is considered in [2], that involves generation of near field codebooks and imaging patterns.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3428288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10633216","","","","2","","3","IEEE","9 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The MIMO version of the WBIA is composed of two circular radiators apart by a small edge-to-edge gap of  $0.018\lambda $ . The MIMO WBIA has a compact radius of 5 mm and a height of 4 mm which exhibits one of the miniaturized sizes previously reported for medical applications. This miniaturization is made possible by the very high permittivity of water and the capacitive effect between the WBIA ground plane and corresponding radiators. Both antennas provide complete control over the operating frequency by adjusting the height and radius of the water (antenna), allowing for customization to suit other desired frequencies. The radiators of both the MIMO antennas are radiating in opposite directions, thus also enabling radiation diversity. In a homogeneous phantom, the MIMO antenna exhibits a wider -10 dB bandwidth of 500 MHz, a higher gain of -18 dBi, and an isolation of 17 dB at 2.45 GHz. Because of the use of water and minimal metal without slots or vias, the proposed antennas exhibit significantly lower specific absorption rate (SAR) values compared to previously reported implantable antennas; therefore, the proposed antennas offer enhanced user safety benefits. Due to electrical properties comparable to human tissue, the proposed WBIAs smoothly transform the radiated energy; therefore, they provide very high radiation efficiencies compared to previously designed antennas. Apart from the aforementioned benefits, the proposed antennas are 3-D printable, thus offering much lower fabrication costs. To validate the performance of a complete system capable of performing biotelemetry, the antennas are integrated with capsule circuitry. The results measured in minced pork are found to be in close agreement with the simulation results. Due to frequency control, flexible functionality, high efficiency, lower SAR, pattern diversity (PD), and lower fabrication costs, the proposed antennas could be more beneficial for MIDs, especially for capsule endoscopes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3383291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10492671","Antenna;biotelemetry;capsule;implants;MIMO antenna;water","Antennas;MIMO communication;Antenna measurements;Permittivity;Fabrication;Costs;Frequency control","","17","","23","IEEE","4 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna features a simple structure consisting of a one-layer planar partially reflective surface (PRS) integrating Fresnel zone plate (FZP), and a one-layer planar meta-ground reflective surface (M-GRS) integrating with a substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW)-based feeding source. We demonstrate a comprehensible approach to observing the amplitude and the phase distributions of the electric field on the FZP integrating with the PRS of the FPC. We suggest using multiple reflections of the waves between the PRS and the ground reflector of the FPC to distribute coherent electric fields on the radiating surface of the FZP such that a high-gain directive beam can be achieved in a thin-profile structure of the FPC. On the other hand, we propose the planar M-GRS to implement phase corrections similar to those for a spherical reflective surface of the FPC, thereby enhancing the bandwidth and gain of the FPC. After careful designs on the three-ring FZP integrated PRS and the M-GRS, the proposed FPC antenna yields a peak gain of 24 dBi at 27.7 GHz with 3-dB gain bandwidth ranging from 26.8 to 28.6 GHz. Its impedance bandwidth of 9.6% is from 26.8 to 29.5 GHz.

It is the first attempt to combine a folded transmitarray (FTA) and a Fabry-Perot cavity (FPC) antenna to achieve bidirectional beams. By using this method, bidirectional radiation can be achieved while keeping a relative low profile when compared to traditional TA antennas. The proposed antenna consists of a dual-polarized (DP) feeding source, a single-layered partially reflective surface (PRS), and a bottom metasurface. By adding metal grids on the bottom surface of the PRS, it can partially reflect the x-polarized electromagnetic (EM) wave and fully reflect the y-polarized EM wave simultaneously. The bottom metasurface can also reflect x-polarized EM wave and transmit y-polarized EM wave. Hence, for the DP feeding source, when the x-polarized wave is generated, forward radiation is realized by FPC effect. When the y-polarized wave is generated, the backward radiation characteristic is achieved due to the FTA function. For validation, a prototype with a center frequency of 35 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured. The proposed antenna can achieve 18 and 21 dBi in the bidirectional directions, respectively. The proposed design is a candidate for mm-wave long-distance wireless systems that require low profile and high communication flexibility.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3407328","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201353); Guangdong Provincial Regional Joint Fund Youth Project(grant numbers:2021A1515110391); Shenzhen Institutions of Higher Learning Stable Support Plan Projects(grant numbers:20220810095646001); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2023A1515011192); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550154","Bidirectional beams;Fabry-Perot cavity (FPC) antenna;folded transmitarray (FTA);high gain;low profile","Antennas;Transmitting antennas;Metals;Surface waves;Substrates;Reflector antennas;Directive antennas","","7","","38","IEEE","5 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna operates in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands of 0.902–0.928 GHz for data telemetry and 2.400–2.4835 GHz for power-saving applications and midfield band (1.704–1.833 GHz) for seamless wireless power transfer (WPT). The antenna has a compact size of  $7.5\times 10.5\times 0.127$  mm3, achieved through the utilization of meandered resonators. The use of meandered resonators also resulted in reduced coupling between the MIMO elements due to opposite flowing current cancellation. The presented MIMO antenna, optimized inside a realistic capsule with batteries, sensors, and electronic components, was fabricated and tested. Simulated and measured results in terms of S-parameters and radiation patterns correlated well with measured bandwidths of 90, 129, and 200 MHz and measured gains of −37.3, −30.3, and −27.9 dBi at 0.915, 1.780, and 2.450 GHz, respectively. Verification of the specific absorption rate (SAR) affirms that the suggested antenna is suitable for utilization within the human body. In addition, based on the link-budget analysis, it can be confirmed that the presented implantable MIMO antenna can establish a reliable communication link up to distances of 14, 9, and 6 m at 0.915, 1.780, and 2.450 GHz, respectively, for transferring high data rate (78 Mb/s) information.

The self-complementary surface (SCS) has been demonstrated to ensure a consistent 90° phase shift between orthogonal linear polarizations. Frequency-selective surface (FSS) is combined to enhance the reflection magnitude for high gain without affecting the polarization conversion characteristics.

The used CP agile 3-bit patch element is enabled by utilizing a reconfigurable feeding network (RFN) composed of two digital phase shifters and a single-pole four-throw (SP4T) switch. By altering the state of RFN, the polarization can be switched between left-handed CP (LHCP) and right-handed CP (RHCP), and eight phase states (i.e., 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°) can be provided simultaneously to realize the 3-bit element. By properly manipulating the array phase distribution, the radiation pattern of the designed  $1\times 8$  array can be dynamically steered in a range from −52° to 52° for each CP mode. Importantly, different from the uniform distribution of elements in traditional arrays, here the adjacent elements of the  $1\times 8$  array based on GPPT are rotated 90° in turn. Due to the opposite geometric phase response between the two CP waves, the co- and cross-polarization components of the array exhibit different phase distribution. Consequently, the cross-polarization in the main beam direction is significantly suppressed within the whole operating frequency band. The joint 3 dB AR relative bandwidth for all states is extended to 20.8%. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, a prototype of the GPPT-based array is fabricated and characterized. The measured results agree well with the simulated ones, thus validating the reconfigurability and the great advantages in broadening the AR bandwidth.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3426315","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201190); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JZ2023HGTB0272); State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves(grant numbers:K202401); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10600122","beam-steering;circularly polarized (CP);geometric phase;propagation phase;reconfigurable antenna","Switches;Phased arrays;Phase shifters;Beam steering;Bandwidth;Probes;Substrates","","2","","28","IEEE","16 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Optimizations based on a cylindrical conformal subarray further improve the beam scanning ability. According to the analyses, the element large-curvature bending suppresses the edge element impedance mismatch and array beam pointing deviation. In addition, the cylindrical contour of the proposed array leads to an obvious scattering cross section reduction (SCSR) compared to flat metal ground, and the co-polarized (co-pol) SCSR is enlarged by in-band absorptions of array elements. To increase the cross-polarized (cr-pol) SCSR, a cr-pol absorbing structure terminated by a resistor is designed in the flexible impedance matching layer of a polyimide (PI) film.

By performing rapid sidelobe time modulation (SLTM), the signal transmitted in the undesired directions (i.e., through sidelobes) undergoes spread-spectrum distortion making it more difficult to be detected, intercepted, and deciphered, while the signal transmitted in the desired direction (i.e., through the main lobe) is unaffected. Therefore, the intended receiver would not need additional modifications (i.e., encryption keys) to detect and recover the signal. We describe the operating principles of this SLTM array and validate its spread-spectrum SLTM sequence generation in undesired directions through theory, simulations, and experiments. Using a fabricated SLTM prototype operating at X-band, we conducted system-level measurements to demonstrate its LPI/LPD, secure communications, and jamming resilience capabilities.

However, they also enable us to create nontrivial waveguide boundaries which offer novel opportunities for the manipulation of the mode profile and propagation constant of electromagnetic waves confined in the space enclosed by them. Here, we study a waveguide that is formed by a general class of MSs, which are both electrically and magnetically polarizable, support multiple resonances and exhibit temporal and spatial dispersion. We investigate the opportunities offered by tailoring the temporal dispersion of the surface conductivities and study three different cases of spatial dispersion, namely, no dispersion, an ideal case of very specific dispersion of the form  $\sigma _{se}\propto k_{t}$  and  $\sigma _{sm}\propto 1/k_{t}$ , and the realistic dispersion of an actual physical implementation based on a metal-backed cut-wire unit cell. Both analytical derivations and full-wave numerical simulations are performed for addressing different scenarios and verifying the results. We show that the proposed metasurface waveguides can enable: 1) the ability to shape the mode profile from concave, to flat, to convex and 2) the possibility of both superluminal and subluminal propagation, as well as both normal and anomalous group velocity dispersion.

For compactness, the LRA elements are placed right next to each other with zero edge spacing (ES), sharing the same middle via a fence on one side. To neutralize the strong space coupling that existed between the antenna elements, the extra cavity coupling is introduced by disconnecting the middle via the fence with the upper ground. With an appropriate dimension of the middle via fence, the electric field coupled through the cavity path is approximately equal in magnitude to that coupled through the space path, but in the opposite direction. Therefore, the isolation between LRA elements is enhanced substantially. By utilizing different shapes of middle via fence, the coupling in both the E- and H-plane placed LRA arrays is reduced significantly. The entire antenna system is very compact and simple without using additional structure. For verification, the decoupling  $1\times 2$  LRA arrays are fabricated and measured.

As the core building block of the radio frequency (RF) subsystem, a unit cell has been proposed, comprised of a dual-cut square-ring resonator (SRR) and a square patch placed above an FR4 substrate backed by a copper plate, inherently anisotropic. This arrangement efficiently converts linearly polarized waves to cross-polarized reflected waves, achieving an 80% conversion efficiency over a wide bandwidth (BW) of 4.72–8.49 GHz. The reflected cross-polarized waves are also inhibited by strategically incorporating just three resistors on the top surface. Therefore, the polarization converter (PC) is transformed into an MA. In contrast to previously known MAs that depended on structural symmetry to maintain stable absorption performances across all polarization angles, this newly proposed asymmetric MA breaks that constraint. It achieves consistent absorption irrespective of variations in the polarization angle of the normal incident waves. The full-wave simulations have resulted in over 80% absorption, closely resembling the initial PC’s reflected BW. This MA has a compact assembly with a size of  $0.22\lambda \times 0.22\lambda $  and a thickness of  $0.07\lambda $ .

The following methodology was implemented, to avoid time-consuming and complex experimental campaigns while still having a relatively representative and sufficient number of statistical samples: first, a simplified ray tracing (RT) code enabled a large number of different rooms to be sampled at moderate computational cost; second, part of these simulations was supported by anechoic chamber measurements; and third, the simulations were carried out using elaborate experimental designs (EDs), based on a categorization of environments and a fairly comprehensive study of building industry data.

However, due to the magnetic field properties of the magnetic viscosity (MV) effect and remanent magnetization intensity, using the traditional time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) forward modeling method for simulation and analysis of B-field will introduce errors and cannot accurately depict the diffusion and attenuation characteristics of B-field. Therefore, a direct 3-D modeling of B-field in TDEM is proposed in the article. We first introduce the forward modeling method of static magnetic field for the calculation of initial value of B-field. Then, we achieve the iterative calculation of B-field of magnetic media during the transient electromagnetic (TEM) stage by substituting the Cole–Cole susceptibility model into the double-curl B-field diffusion equation of magnetization intensity. The validity of this method is verified using several analytical solutions. 3-D multimagnetic anomaly models are established, and the characteristics of B-field responses are observed in three dimensions. This method can realize the 3-D modeling of the B-field of the MV effect in TDEM, which is helpful to accurately understand the characteristics of the B-field attenuation curves and can provide a basis for the direct inversion interpretation of B-field data.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3421532","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:423B2406,42104140,42030104); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3900200); Scientific Research Project of Education Department of Jilin Province(grant numbers:JJKH20231137KJ); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10594716","3-D fractional modeling;B-field;magnetic viscosity (MV) effect;superconductive quantum interference device-transient electromagnetic (SQUID-TEM) system;time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) method","Magnetic domains;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Magnetic susceptibility;Magnetization;Magnetic flux;Mathematical models;Antennas and propagation","","1","","34","IEEE","10 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The suggested method derives the rational polynomial form of  $\chi (k_{\parallel })$ , which can then be expressed in the space-domain using spatial derivatives of the fields, resulting in a corresponding higher order spatial boundary condition to achieve the desired field operation. The proposed synthesis method is illustrated using variety of examples such as a space plate, spatial filters, and field absorbers, which are then validated using an integral equation (IE) solver, in which the corresponding higher order boundary conditions are integrated to predict the scattered fields. The proposed method thus not only represents a simple way to synthesize ideal zero-thickness metasurfaces but also helps establishes a way to define fundamental operational limits of spatially dispersive metasurfaces.

A residual-driven formulation improves convergence and enables matrix sparsification. Macro basis functions (MBFs) are incorporated, with convergence to user-specified error tolerance maintained. Through near-interaction preconditioning, local domain extensions are rendered implicit, removing the need for overlapping local solutions. A single-level, hybrid nested cross-approximation (NCA) acceleration scheme is employed. Rapid, controllable convergence is demonstrated for very large arrays. Faster runtimes than with the multilevel fast multipole method (MLFMM) in the commercial FEKO software suite, are demonstrated.

This process reduces the complexity of model discretization compared to traditional numerical algorithms. Furthermore, to avoid the generation of large-scale sparse matrices in FEM implementation, the tangential electric field partial differential equations (TEF-PDEs) are established in fully anisotropic medium. This is achieved by transforming the spatial partial differential operator tensor in the 3-D vector wave equation into an antisymmetric tensor.

This model is based on: 1) S-parameters describing the coupling between the ports; 2) embedded element radiation patterns associated with each port; and 3) structural scattering under multiple incident wave directions. To construct the model, one set of electromagnetic descriptions (e.g., simulations or measurements) needs to be done for a structure before computing the scattering properties of the structure for arbitrary tunable load values. Unlike many other methods, the proposed method fully takes into account structural scattering in different directions simultaneously and requires no simplifications or approximations to the scattering structure, such as the assumption of local periodicity or element identity. This method facilitates characterizing the scattering ability of the structure in terms of bistatic cross section (BCS), also known as bistatic radar cross section (bRCS), and can be beneficial, for instance, in designing RISs and backscatter systems.

Thus, efficient and accurate modal analysis for CBSAs is of great engineering significance. However, the conventional modal analysis method, i.e., the cavity-mode analysis, cannot be used to explore the external-resonance characteristics, and other existing modal analysis methods, such as the full-structure characteristic mode (CM) and classic aperture CM (CACM), are also inefficient for analyzing the CBSAs. In this communication, the concept of substructure is generalized to encompass not only the physical body but also an aperture acting as an interface for power flow. This generalization, along with proper electromagnetic (EM) modeling, leads to the development of a novel substructure CM formulation specific to the CBSAs. By employing this new formulation, the external-resonance characteristics can be accurately revealed. To validate effectiveness of the proposed formulation, a low-profile bandwidth-enhanced substrate-integrated-waveguide (SIW) CBSA and a low-profile circularly polarized CBSA are explored.

To address this challenge, this communication explores the efficient simulation of coaxial-fed structures using the discontinuous Galerkin integral equation (DGIE) method.

To obtain the desired output modes over a broad bandwidth, a two-level optimization algorithm based on mode matching theory and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is developed. A smooth-wall oversized multimode horn is designed, fabricated, and validated via measurements. The measurement results indicate that the horn can output highly symmetric fields. The radiation patterns are highly consistent within ±8° range, and the gain change is less than 0.4 dBi in the frequency range of 32–38 GHz.
