It enables radar receiving identical power in the field of view, provided that the radar cross section levels of targets within the illuminated area are similar. Different from “one-way” communication application, the SAR is a “two-way” system such that the received power is inversely proportional to  $R^{4}$ , not  $R^{2}$ , where  $R$  is the distance between target and radar. Thus, conventional cosecant squared patterns are not suitable for SAR. Here, the concept and link properties of the proposed cosecant fourth power pattern are introduced, while its synthesis process is facilitated by a mixed optimization method, including nonlinear fitting and active pattern methods. As demonstrated, an array prototype, which consists of 12 series-fed patch subarrays and a substrate integrated waveguide network for power distributing and phase shifting, is designed and fabricated. Particularly, the power-distributing section only consists of symmetrical T-junctions with equal power division, thus making the antenna more tolerant to fabrication error. Good cosecant fourth pattern performance is achieved from 23.8 to 25.0 GHz. The presented array also owns the advantage of low profile ( $\sim 0.09\lambda _{0}$ ), compact, reliable, and low cost.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2999669","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61627801); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB0101000); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9112654","Cosecant fourth power pattern;millimeter-wave (mmW) antenna array;substrate integrated waveguide (SIW);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Antenna arrays;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Radar antennas","","38","","29","IEEE","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna consists of a circular patch and several shorting pins. Equivalent inductance is brought to the patch after introducing shorting pins. Thus, resonance of the patch shifts at higher frequency. Compared to a conventional circular patch without any pins, radiation area of the proposed patch is enlarged given the same resonance frequency, hence leads to gain enhancement. The number of pins introduced to a circular patch can be set freely due to its symmetrical feature. Moreover, surface current is restricted within a small area around the center of the patch after introducing multiple pins, leading to more concentrated radiation. An equivalent circuit model is built for the proposed antenna. Layout and number optimization rules for introducing shorting pins are formulated. With these rules, gain of a circular patch can be maximized for the applications under certain size restrictions. A prototype operating at 5.8 GHz is designed and fabricated. Furthermore, a 2*2 array based on the gain-enhanced circular patch elements is implemented.

The proposed antenna consists of a feed monopole antenna, a holographic metasurface using slotted patches, and a two-layered resistive metasurface. Within its operating band, the holographic metasurface manipulates the surface wave into a y-polarized broadside plane wave and vice versa, which simultaneously realizes high gain and in-band low RCS for y-polarized incidence. In addition, slotted patches are utilized as unit cells of the holographic metasurface to further enhance the antenna gain. The resistive metasurface used in the proposed antenna has a transmission window for the ypolarized waves. After integration with the proposed holographic metasurface, it exhibits absorption-reflection-absorption and wideband absorption responses for the yand x-polarized waves, respectively. Thus, not only is good radiation performance maintained but also the in-band RCS for x-polarized incidence and out-of-band RCS for both polarizations are significantly reduced. Compared to a conventional holographic antenna, the gain of the proposed antenna was enhanced by 1.4 dB at 10 GHz.

The antenna is developed on a textile material by using an advanced screen-printing technology and, thus, exhibits a very good structural flexibility and a high manufacturing accuracy. To improve the bandwidths at the two input ports, an innovative method is introduced for the first time where two additional strips are incorporated into the antenna design. These additional strips are placed perpendicularly to the feed lines to generate another resonant frequency, which is then combined with the fundamental mode of the patch antenna, producing the second-order resonant properties with enhanced bandwidths. The proposed strips are also beneficial to significantly improve the isolation between the two channels/ports. To maintain a robust linkage, a study of structural deformation is carried out by bending the antenna along both the 0° and 45° directions. The experimental results also show that the antenna is robust to the human tissue loading, where the specific absorption rate (SAR) is lower than 0.37 W/kg when the antenna is fully attached. The measured results agree reasonably well with the simulations providing experimental verification of the design concept. The antenna is believed to be the first dual-mode textile antenna of its type which features a low profile, improved bandwidth, high isolation, and low cost, making it a good candidate for potential full-duplex wearable applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2989862","National Science Foundation ASSIST Nanosystems ERC(grant numbers:EEC-1160483); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9082102","Antennas;full-duplex;screen printing;textile antenna;wearable applications","Bandwidth;Textiles;Resonant frequency;Antenna measurements;Scattering parameters;Feeds","","68","","35","IEEE","29 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the distinct phase constants for the EM fields on the two sides of the asymmetric structures, the transformation of phase difference for the EM waves is realized. Superposition in the endfire direction for the in-phase and out-of-phase EM fields forms the endfire radiations with sum and difference beams.

A key parameter is the correlation matrix, which relates the antenna patterns and the multipath propagation. The correlation governs communication metrics such as the various capacities, error rates, and outages. Calculation of the correlation matrix requires accurate measurements of the complex far-field patterns of the antennas, and there is a need to verify that both the measurement and the calculation are accurate. An approach is presented for benchmarking the measured correlation accuracy by using a biconical antenna with a closed-form expression for its wideband correlation function. The approach is demonstrated by checking both physical and numerical experiments (simulation) against the theory. It benchmarks the accuracy of both the measurement and calculation stages for the antenna correlation in a rich isotropic multipath propagation environment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2998431","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:CGSD2-535282-2019); Cette recherche a été financée par le Conseil de recherches en sciences naturelles et en génie du Canada (CRSNG) sur la bourse(grant numbers:CGSD2-535282-2019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9108565","3-D-printed antenna;antenna correlation;antenna diversity;antenna measurements;antenna radiation pattern synthesis;biconical antenna;linear antenna;multiple-input;multiple-output (MIMO) systems;optical fiber measurement applications;wideband antenna","Antenna measurements;Correlation;Dipole antennas;Benchmark testing;Wires;Feeds","","2","","36","IEEE","4 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The relationship is valid for general structures even when the spatial granularity is comparable to the operating and modulation wavelengths. In the limit of infinitesimal unit cell, the dispersion relation reduces identically to its continuous counterpart. For homogeneous space-time modulated media, the time periodic circuit approach allows the extension of the well-known telegraphist's equations. The time harmonics are coupled together to form an infinite system of coupled differential equations. At the scattering centers, where the interaction is mediated via the modulation (pump wave), the telegraphist's equations reduce to the interaction of two waves only: the signal and idler. The interaction can then be described using three wave mixing, satisfying the phase matching condition. It is demonstrated that the time periodic S parameters provide an alternative and appealing visualization of the modal conversion and the emergence of nonreciprocity inside the bandgaps.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2985712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063633","Nonreciprocity;space–time periodic;time periodic","Harmonic analysis;Modulation;Periodic structures;Dispersion;Media;Capacitance;Time-frequency analysis","","17","","54","IEEE","10 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Calibration from the digital radiometer is performed using tip-curve calibration procedures. Atmospheric fading is then obtained by observing the beacon as well as the radiometric signals. This enables the comparison of fading obtained by the two techniques and provides a means to calibrate the received beacon power level to obtain total atmospheric attenuation.

This class of polarization converters can transform linearly polarized waves into right- and left-hand circularly polarized (RHCP and LHCP) waves in two separate non-adjacent frequency bands. The reported polarizer is made of three cascaded bianisotropic sheet admittances, spaced by two isotropic dielectric slabs. The electromagnetic problem is studied using impedance boundary conditions. A transmission-matrix analysis of periodically-loaded transmission lines is employed in the design. An analytic model is developed, and closed-form expressions are derived for the frequency response of each sheet admittance. This method avoids the use of multi-parameter optimization procedures. An example of a dual-band, orthogonally-polarized LP-to-CP converter is proposed for satellite communication applications in the K-/Ka-band. The polarizer separately performs LP-to-LHCP and LP-to-RHCP conversions over the transmit (TX) and receive (RX) channels of the K-/Ka-band. The design is validated with a prototype.

The MedRadio frequency band (401-406 MHz) offers an acceptable penetration of electromagnetic (EM) fields in biological tissues and thus is well suited for wireless medical telemetry (WMT). Unlike other parts of the body, head tissues exhibit a high level of EM fields absorption, which provides a significant challenge for devices implanted in this part of the body. Therefore, it is important to appraise data communication and path loss over this difficult channel. In this article, a brain implantable antenna and an exterior antenna are developed to operate at 406 MHz MedRadio band. The exterior antenna is a miniaturized composite loop-patch antenna with tuning slots, whilst the implantable antenna is a capacitively loaded loop with parasitic patches. A near-field communication link is tested via a software-defined radio (SDR) module in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phantom and pig primate. The link budget of the in situ communication link demonstrates a reliable data transfer of 200 kb/s with a low level of input power (-17.55 dBm) and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for near-field transmission. Since, the EM fields decay rapidly in head tissues, a path loss model is thus essential for BIMDs. The developed path loss model in CSF phantom and pig primate yield an attenuation between 43 and 56 dB for a distance ranging from 20 to 60 mm at 406 MHz. Overall, the results show that near-field data communication link for BIMDs can be utilized over the conventional far-field link for a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a low power requirement.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2993106","Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9108598","Biological tissues;implants;near-field;path loss;wireless medical telemetry (WMT)","Couplings;Magnetic heads;Resonant frequency;Slot antennas;Monitoring;Dielectrics","","9","","54","IEEE","4 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These field expressions are then utilized to derive an advantageous form of an exact expansion for the total radiated power and associated radiation resistance. This derivation is carried out in an elegant and complete manner by invoking properties of generalized hypergeometric functions as well as gamma and beta functions.

By slightly breaking the shorting wall of the HMSIW cavity and loading a printed monopole, the resonance characteristics of the HMSIW cavity can be made intact while the additional monopole can be excited. The open edge of the HMSIW cavity is equivalent to a magnetic current. This equivalent magnetic current is orthogonal to the electric current introduced by the monopole, thus they form a pair of complementary sources. Because the backward radiation of the complementary sources can be canceled out, a remarkable unidirectional radiation performance is achieved. To improve the symmetry of the radiation pattern and enhance the antenna gain, a cascaded cavity array is then studied. By alternately connecting the complementary elements, all equivalent magnetic currents of the HMSIW cavities and all electric currents of the monopoles can work in-phase, thus a broadside radiation can be achieved. In this communication, a 1 × 5 array based on the proposed complementary element and a corresponding array based on the classical HMSIW cavity cell are comparatively analyzed. It is found that the impedance characteristics and radiation gain of the HMSIW cavity can be kept intact by the proposed structure.

Conformal antennas that can be simply operated to have multifunctional performance characteristics are therefore of interest. In this communication, we present a gradient-index lens antenna designed to radiate with a 45° beamwidth across eight different sectors. When fed by a simple switched feeding network, the lens is able to provide 360° azimuth coverage in 45° segments. Further analysis of the radiation patterns shows how two distinct multibeam patterns can be produced from simple feed networks and simultaneous excitation of each feeding element. The proposed lens is fabricated by multimaterial 3-D printing. The final lens radiates with a gain of 8.5 dBi when a single sector is excited, and with a maximum gain of 5.9 dBi in multibeam mode.

The original DAT fails in these two situations and, hence, limits its applications. The reasons that cause such an instability are studied. Two additional transformations are introduced to make the DAT stable for these two cases. For situation I, the exponential transformation (ET) is adopted to optimize the distribution of the Gaussian quadrature points.
