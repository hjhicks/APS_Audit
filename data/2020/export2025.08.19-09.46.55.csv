The antenna array is composed of a number of split-ring resonators (SRRs) with a rotation angle α difference. For circularly polarized (CP) waves, each two adjacent SRRs exhibit α and 2α P-B phase differences under feeding and normally illuminating, respectively. Because of this, the SRR array exhibits different phase gradients for radiated and reflected waves. To obtain multiple LP beams, reversed phase gradients for CP waves are alternatively arranged in 1-D or 2-D on the array, leading to two or four beams, respectively. Under normally illuminating, the reflection phases along the array form the checkerboard configuration, which can reduce both the in-band RCS and out-of-band RCS of the antenna array. As an example, we demonstrate a low-RCS four-beam antenna operating in X-band. Both the simulated and measured results show that the maximal realized gain of each beam reaches up to about 13.6 dB at 10.2 GHz. To evaluate the RCS reduction performance, we measured specular reflection of the prototype under normal incidence. The reflection is reduced by more than 10 dB in 9.7-10.3 GHz and by more than 5 dB out-of-band in 10.3-14.0 GHz. The design method provides an alternative to the design of low-RCS and low-profile antenna arrays.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2929573","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771485,61331005,61471388,61501503,61601507); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:SQ2017YFA0700201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8782128","Antenna array;checkerboard configuration;multi-beam;Pancharatnam–Berry (P-B) phase;RCS reduction","Reflection;Antenna arrays;Bandwidth;Antenna measurements;Microstrip;Antenna radiation patterns","","40","","35","IEEE","30 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The LWAs are implemented in groove-gap waveguide (GGW) technology. To mitigate the beam squint due to the dispersive nature of LWAs, complementary-dispersive prisms are coupled to the LWA radiation aperture. The antennas are implemented in fully metallic purely holey periodic structures, resulting in a more cost-effective and robust manufacturing process compared to previously reported pin-based structures. Two prisms are proposed, one with mirror symmetry and one with glide symmetry. When the prism possesses a glide symmetry, much fewer holes are required while maintaining a similar performance, which even further decreases the fabrication costs. The complex propagation constant is optimized for low sidelobe levels (SLLs) with tailored hole diameters and waveguide dimensions, thus for the first time demonstrating the capability of using glide-symmetric holes to control the leakage rate. Two prototypes with mirror- and glide-symmetric prisms are theoretically synthesized and validated by the simulated and experimental results. A frequency bandwidth of 11% is achieved for both prototypes with the beam squint within ±0.9° (mirror) and ±1.7° (glide), SLLs below -15 dB (mirror) and -13 dB (glide), total efficiency almost 90%, and realized gain of 17 ± 0.5 dB at a fixed observing angle.

Different from conventional slot antennas, two short sides of the slot are open which do not connect to any metal. To excite the open slot, an SIW section is used as the feed. In this way, the antenna is constructed on a single laminate which includes the feeding structure and the radiator. The open slot structure serves as a single-mode resonator with a low Q-factor and, thus, contributes a much wider bandwidth than that of conventional slot antennas and simultaneously maintains stable radiation performance. Intensive parametric studies were implemented to provide a design guideline. To verify our design, antenna prototypes were fabricated and measured. The measured results validate that the antenna achieves a wide impedance bandwidth of 59.3% from 50.8 to 93.6 GHz. Meanwhile, the radiation patterns keep stable over the entire operating frequency band.

This formula is applicable to any incident field configuration, and valid at any frequency at which the thin wire approximation applies. It separates the response of the antenna into three parts, one of which may be viewed as the intended response of the antenna.

A miniaturized-element frequency selective surface (MEFSS) cover is utilized on top of the chip to provide gain enhancement, which is essential for many applications such as radar and communication systems. This is important due to the restrictions on the thickness of metallic layers, losses in substrate, and limitations in real estate. The MEFSS cover consists of partially reflecting surface (PRS) and high-impedance surface (HIS) creating a Fabry-Pérot-type cavity (FPC). When the MEFSS structure is used, the height of FPC can be reduced without causing any deterioration to the antenna radiation. A proximity patch antenna is embedded in the HIS layer, which is fed by a small metallic trace on the last layer of chip using the coupling mechanism. By utilizing the transverse-equivalent network (TEN) of the structure and imposing the resonance condition, the geometrical parameters of the MEFSS unit cell is calculated. For demonstration purposes, a scaled MEFSS cover for gain enhancement at the center frequency of 10 GHz is designed, fabricated, and tested. The measured results, which are in agreement with simulations, show that the proposed technique is reliable in practice and gain enhancement of 9 dB can be achieved for a single-patch antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2948508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883190","Chip;CMOS;Fabry–Pérot cavity (FPC);metamaterial;miniaturized-element frequency selective surface (MEFSS)","Periodic structures;Frequency selective surfaces;Surface waves;Feeds;Substrates;Silicon","","12","","44","IEEE","25 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It consists of two dual-band printed inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) and two SIW leaky wave antennas. By using the structure-reused technology, PIFA for the Wi-Fi application and the SIW antenna for the Wi-Gig application can share the same radiator without adding an extra aperture area.

In brief, BMAs are ultra-wideband, pyramid-shaped antennas that utilize the periodic combination of water and plastic to enhance performance. The new modeling enables customized performance for applications as diverse as radiometry, telemetry with implants, and more. Our studies utilize the comparison of the BMA to a conical antenna to model the low-frequency cutoff. In addition, we conduct a plane wave expansion method analysis of the engineered periodic dielectrics to 1) model the high-frequency cutoff of the BMA and 2) predict the permittivity of the bio-matched dielectric. Parametric studies are further pursued to assess transmission loss as a function of the BMA's height. We verify our design framework through a novel BMA that operates from 1 to 12 GHz with 21.4 dB of transmission loss through 3 cm of tissue at 2.4 GHz. Compared to the most wideband and most efficient into-body radiator previously reported, this has 6.2 dB less transmission loss, with the new design also exhibiting nearly twice as much bandwidth.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2948727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8884638","Biomedical telemetry;engineered dielectrics;into-body antenna;wearable antenna","Antennas;Dielectrics;Permittivity;Bandwidth;Biological tissues;Propagation losses;Implants","","16","","35","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An equivalent circuit model combined with broadband phase shift network is developed to effectively design the metaatoms in metasurface. It is the first time to design wideband metasurfaces with the phase-based characteristics. To verify the proposed model, some deformed square loop meta-atoms are proposed to construct the metasurfaces with broadband OAM characteristic. Moreover, the vortex beams with the integer (l = -3), fractional (l = -1.5), and high-order (l = -10) OAM mode are generated.

In the emerging millimeter (mm)-wave technology for the next-generation communication and autonomous driving, antireflection treatment is increasingly important due to the quasi-optical nature of electromagnetic waves at high frequencies. Enclosures that protect radar or communication phased arrays will introduce reflections if they are not designed properly. In this article, a novel metamaterial radome (meta-radome) is developed based on closely spaced metallic square meshes patterned on a thin dielectric substrate. We show that by deliberately employing the coupling between the meshes, the entire structure can be treated as a homogenized metamaterial slab with its wave impedance matched to that of free space. The resulting meta-radome can be optimized to have good transmission (> 90%) over an extremely wide range of angles of incidence (0° - 80°) for both transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) polarizations. Since the meta-radome is not resonant, it has a very small Ohmic loss and broad bandwidth. In addition, the proposed meta-radome is very easy to fabricate with standard fabrication techniques. Thus, it can be very attractive for many practical microwave and mm-wave applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2951491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8895762","Antireflection;mesh;metamaterial;radome;wire grid","Radomes;Substrates;Permittivity;Dielectrics;Metamaterials;Radar;Impedance","","40","","37","IEEE","11 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All the proposed split matrices yield implicit electric field update equations with tridiagonal or block tridiagonal matrices on the left-hand sides. For more efficiency, the block tridiagonal matrices for implicit electric field may be reformulated and replaced with tridiagonal matrices for implicit magnetic field. The stability analysis is first performed using the von Neumann method in the Fourier domain. It is shown that the von Neumann method alone may not be sufficient to ascertain stability for inhomogeneous media. To include media inhomogeneity, the two-media reduced-matrix stability analysis is proposed. It allows us to efficiently analyze the key stability characteristics in inhomogeneous media and is useful for quick detection of any potential instability that is not apparent via the von Neumann method.

As such there is motivation to better understand how both linearly and CP systems perform in depolarizing environments. In this article, we present a 3-D geometry-based stochastic channel model (GBSCM) for dual-polarized systems to evaluate circular and LP in cluttered settings. Using a Poisson distribution, the model generates a number of multipath scatterers. Measurements have been conducted at 2.4 GHz to validate the model.

In this article, a comparison of the differential form of Bouguer’s law and Snell’s law is used to develop a composite refractive index. This enables the problem of how electromagnetic waves propagate in spherical medium to be converted into one of how they propagate in cuboid medium. By providing a way of solving eikonal equations according to a Cartesian coordinate system, the problems associated with traditional methods are overcome.

Magnetically coupled coils are commonly used for near-field magneto-inductive (MI) communication. Alternatively, it is possible to create ULF magnetic fields of sufficient amplitude by rotating permanent magnets. In this work, a ULF magnetic field generator has been created using a rotating permanent magnet. It has been shown that the proposed field generator outperforms a conventional coil source (23 dB of field strength for the same volume and dissipated power that is 0.35 W), which can be a considerable advantage for low size, weight, and power applications. A method to produce amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation signals using a modulation coil was proposed and analyzed. It was demonstrated that the inductance of the modulation coil is not critical for achieving acceptable modulation ratios, which opens a possibility for a compact ASK generator design.

Therefore, the non-steady ablation process of the antenna-radome system is analyzed. Based on geometrical optics, the transmission performance of the radome under variations of material and structural parameters that are caused by high-temperature ablation is calculated. In addition, the excitation amplitude and phase errors that are output by the transmitter and receiver (T/R) module and amplified by array power supply ripple are analyzed as the temperature of the antenna is increased. An electromechanically coupled model is established accordingly for evaluating the electromagnetic performance of the antenna-radome system with variations of the material and structural parameters of the radome and the excitation current errors of the array elements. A compensation calculation model of the excitation amplitude and phase of the array elements that is based on the coupled model is presented. Finally, a hypersonic vehicle is considered as an example on which to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed coupled model and compensation method. Aerodynamic heat analysis is applied to determine the boundary heat flux density of the radome. Transient thermal analysis, in combination with the “life and death element” method, is used to obtain the temperature distribution and ablation morphology of the antenna-radome system in real time. The performance of the antenna-radome system is calculated and compensated at multiple frequencies and multiple scanning angles.

On the one hand, CP radiation is obtained due to the polarization conversion characteristic of the metamaterials. A sequentially rotated feeding network is employed for wide operating bandwidth, polarization purity, and radiation pattern symmetry. The measured results show that the array has a wide usable bandwidth of 18.4%, the common part of an impedance bandwidth of 37.3% (4.80–7.00 GHz), a 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 22.5% (5.00–6.27 GHz), and a 3 dB gain bandwidth of 18.4% (4.94–5.94 GHz).

First, a phase-gradient metasurface composed of two crossed arrays of striplines mounted on both sides of a substrate, an insulation space, and a ground plane is implemented to achieve 2-D retrodirective characteristics at a specific angle by precisely tuning the dimensions of its supercells. Second, unlike existing designs, the effects of the distance between the striplines and the ground plane on the performance of the retrodirective metasurface are investigated to broaden the bandwidth of retroreflection. Theoretical studies, full-wave simulations, and experimental results are presented to evaluate the scattering properties of the three types of 2-D retrodirective metasurface corresponding to the three retrodirected angles of -20°, -30°, and -40°. The fractional 3 dB bandwidths of the retroreflections are improved depending on the specific values of h and the incident angle. The results show a good agreement that the retrodirective angles for the incident waves along the x- and y-directions can be controlled independently and simultaneously. The measured radar cross section (RCS) results show a power efficiency of more than 94% in both directions at the retrodirected angles of -20°, -30°, and -40° at 5.8 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2940501","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education through the Basic Science Research Program(grant numbers:2015R1A6A1A03031833); Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) support program(grant numbers:IITP-2019-2016-0-00291); Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839689","Broadband;generalized Snell’s law;metasurface;retrodirectivity","Stripline;Reflection;Two dimensional displays;Antenna arrays;Broadband antennas;Broadband communication;Substrates","","16","","28","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, we alleviate the issue of full parabolic-phased method through hybridizing two strategies, i.e., concave/convex chessboard arrangement and random focal lengths. The proposed hybrid design makes the phase profile aperiodic without any mirror symmetry, which is the key for achieving perfect diffusive scattering behavior within a wide operation band. The numerical and experimental results show that our proposed design features broadband, polarization insensitivity, and wide incidence angle and can efficiently decrease the RCS more than 10 dB within 7.8-23.2 GHz.
