It consists of a filtering patch antenna and a bandstop filter (BSF), with their transfer functions being complementary to each other. A slot is fabricated in each of the patch and ground, giving a total of two radiation nulls for the lower bandedge. By using a dual-stub feed, two radiation nulls are also obtained for the upper bandedge. For the BSF, a λg/2 defected ground structure (DGS) and a λg/4 defected microstrip structure (DMS) are used in the design. It is terminated by a chip resistor. Since the filtering patch antenna and BSF have complementary transfer functions, the incident energy can be radiated effectively in the passband but largely absorbed by the resistor in the stopbands. As a result, only little energy will be reflected over a wide frequency range, giving a reflectionless characteristic. To demonstrate this idea, an absorptive filtering antenna operating at 5.8 GHz was designed, fabricated, and tested. Its impedance is matched from 5 to 6.5 GHz, with the measured out-of-band suppression being higher than 17 and 20 dB for the lower and upper stopbands, respectively. The measured peak realized gain is 7.28 dBi.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2938798","General Research Fund (GRF) Grant from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:CityU 11215217); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61728106); Fundamental Research Program of Shenzhen City(grant numbers:JCYJ20170818094814530); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827608","Absorptive filter;bandstop filter (BSF);defected ground structure (DGS);defected microstrip structure (DMS);filtering antenna;patch antenna;reflectionless filter","Transmitting antennas;Resistors;Patch antennas;Antenna measurements;Slot antennas;Passband","","94","","24","IEEE","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Rigorous Evaluation of Losses in Uniform Leaky-Wave Antennas","W. Fuscaldo","Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"3 Feb 2020","2020","68","2","643","655","General formulas are proposed for thoroughly evaluating the radiation efficiency of traveling-wave antennas operating in any radiating regime. Indeed, existing theoretical models only work in the scanned-beam region, where the radiating mode is considerably above cutoff and the perturbation method applies. The analysis provided here extends the application of the perturbation method close to the cutoff condition, thus providing a correct estimation of the losses even in the case of broadside radiation. This case is particularly important for Fabry-Perot cavity leaky-wave antennas (FPC-LWAs) based on partially reflecting screens (PRSs), which are commonly designed to generate a broadside pencil beam. However, the previous works on FPC-LWAs always assume either a lossless PRS, or a lossless dielectric cover layer thus neglecting metal and dielectric losses: a hypothesis that is no longer fulfilled at high frequencies, such as millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave frequencies. An original theoretical framework is thus developed to derive analytical formulas for a rigorous evaluation of losses when either lossy PRS or lossy dielectric cover layers are employed. Interestingly, the equivalence between a lossy PRS and a lossy dielectric cover layer is shown from a theoretical viewpoint. All the findings derived here are validated through full-wave simulations to corroborate the proposed analysis.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2940464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839688","Fabry–Perot cavity (FPC) antennas;frequency selective surfaces;leaky waves;leaky-wave antennas (LWAs);metasurfaces;terahertz (THz)","Dielectric losses;Perturbation methods;Leaky wave antennas;Cavity resonators;Millimeter wave technology","","28","","36","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, a pair of long slots is etched symmetrically on the top broadside of an SIW working in the TE20 mode. With the odd-symmetry of TE20 mode field distribution, the even-symmetrically etched long slots paired along the centerline of the SIW have aperture fields of the same direction, thereby resulting in a constructive superposition of radiation. Thanks to these long slots with a meandering shape that is designed according to a specific aperture amplitude illumination (e.g., -35 dB Taylor line-source distribution) and their even-symmetry with respect to the centerline of the SIW, both low side-lobe and low cross-polarization are simultaneously achieved. Two meandering schemes with respect to the centerline of the SIW are adopted and, thus, two types of the designed LWAs are developed. For experimental prototypes of the proposed LWAs, a 3 dB directional coupler and a 90° phase shifter are combined together to excite the desired TE20 mode of the SIW. The proposed two types of LWAs are modeled, simulated, and fabricated.

"Miniaturized RFID Reader Antennas Based on CRLH Negative Order Resonance","Z. Wang; Y.

Miniaturization is achieved by using the first negative order resonance (-1st mode). These proposed CRLH resonators are realized by etching gap on the patch surface, which acts as a series left-handed (LH) capacitor as well as an effective radiator, and using metallic screws on the corner as steadying posts while also providing an LH inductor. Different from the traditional mushroom structures, these screws are placed on the two sides or corner of the unit cells allowing unobstructed current and field flowing inside the cavity. This enhances the quality factor and radiation efficiency. In addition, only metallic sheets, screws, and one thin substrate are used in the design, therefore dielectric loss is basically eliminated. Overall, these proposed antennas achieve a miniaturized size, as well as a high gain and radiation efficiency. The radiation characteristics of these RFID antennas are similar to the conventional patch antennas due to the -1st-order operation. Four antennas, including linearly polarized, circularly polarized (CP), frequency-tunable, and polarization/frequency-reconfigurable antennas, are carefully designed, investigated, and experimentally verified. Remarkable agreement has been observed between simulation and measurement. These antennas well cover 902-928 MHz UHF band. RF range tests are carried out for application verification. They demonstrate a compact size, low-cost, low-loss, and high efficiency with easy implementation. The CP antennas exhibit a good bandwidth and an excellent axial ratio in the whole upper semisphere. They have been selected for mass production, which illustrates a good engineering application example of CRLH metamaterial antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2940500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839701","Circular polarization;composite right-/left-handed (CRLH);metamaterial antenna;miniaturized antenna;negative order resonance;reconfigurable antenna;radio frequency identification (RFID);tunable antenna","Antennas;Fasteners;Radiofrequency identification;Dispersion;Equivalent circuits;Capacitors;Inductors","","35","","45","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, it allows diverse ways of operation: feeding through a rectangular waveguide provides single circular polarization, while square waveguide is used for dual circular polarization. The radiating element has been designed at the Ku band and validated by the competitive experimental results. In the case of single circular polarization, over 21% bandwidth has been obtained under 15 dB return loss and 3 dB axial ratio criteria, with a radiating element height of 0.75λ0 (free-space wavelength) at 18 GHz.

It consists of two closely located $1 \times 4$ subarrays for the digital cellular system (DCS) and wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) operations. The band-notched slot antenna (BNSA) is designed and adopted as the subarray element with radiation-suppression characteristic at notch frequencies. The notch frequency for one subarray is designed at the center operating frequency of the other subarray. As a result, the radiation from DCS subarray could be effectively suppressed within the WCDMA band and vice versa, resulting in high isolation between two subarrays with a small separation distance. By using the artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) reflector, the array height could be reduced by half, as compared with the perfect electric conductor (PEC) counterpart. In addition, a four-way unequal power divider is designed for the array's beam-pattern synthesis. For the demonstration, the proposed array is fabricated and measured.

The metallic strips layer can be regarded as a shunt capacitance between the array and free space. Additionally, equivalent circuit models were established to analyze the function of the introduced parasitic slot and metallic strips layer.

The decoupling method does not require any physical connection or obstruction between coupled antennas. The significance of the proposed decoupling technique is fourfold: 1) it works for inverted-F antennas (IFAs), monopole antennas, and loop antennas, the most three commonly used antenna forms for mobile terminals; 2) the inherent improvement on matching conditions after decoupling; 3) the flexibility in implementation owing to its detachment from the antenna body; and 4) the applicability to an array with more than two elements.

Digital multibeam beamforming has maximum degrees of freedom compared to analog-phased arrays. However, circuit complexity and power consumption are important constraints for digital multibeam systems. A low-complexity digital computing architecture is proposed for a multiplication-free 32-point linear transform that approximates multiple simultaneous radio frequency (RF) beams similar to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Arithmetic complexity due to multiplication is reduced from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) complexity of O(N log N) for DFT realizations, down to zero, thus yielding a 46% and 55% reduction in chip area and dynamic power consumption, respectively, for the N = 32 case considered. This article describes the proposed 32-point DFT approximation targeting 1024 beams using a 2-D array and shows the multiplierless approximation and its mapping to a 32-beam subsystem consisting of 5.8 GHz antennas that can be used for generating 1024 digital beams without multiplications. Real-time beam computation is achieved using a Xilinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA) at 120 MHz bandwidth per beam. Theoretical beam performance is compared with measured RF patterns from both a fixed-point FFT and the proposed multiplier-free algorithm and is in good agreement.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2938704","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:SpecEES 1854798,ECCS 1902283); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8826444","Approximate beamforming;digital arrays;multibeams","Array signal processing;Discrete Fourier transforms;Antenna arrays;5G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Computer architecture;Apertures","","21","","49","IEEE","6 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More seriously, modeling both vertical and horizontal energized cased boreholes in layered media is exceptionally difficult.

The straightforward solution by the method of moments (MoM) for the volume integral equation method is computationally expensive. Due to the shift-invariance and correlation properties of the layered-medium Green's functions, the stabilized-biconjugate gradient fast Fourier transform (BCGS-FFT) has been developed to greatly reduce the computational complexity of the MoM, but so far this method is limited to objects located in a homogeneous background or in the same layer of a layered medium background. For those problems with objects located in different layers, FFT cannot be applied directly in the direction normal to the layer interfaces, thus the MoM solution requires huge computer memory and CPU time. To overcome these difficulties, the BCGS-FFT method combined with the domain decomposition method (DDM) is proposed in this article. With the BCGS-FFT-DDM, the objects or different parts of an object are first treated separately in several subdomains, each of which satisfies the 3-D shift-invariance and correlation properties; the couplings among the different objects/parts are then taken into account, where the coupling matrices can be built to satisfy the 2-D shift-invariance property if the objects/subdomains have the same mesh size on the xy plane. Hence, 3-D FFT and 2-D FFT can respectively be applied to accelerate the selfand mutual-coupling matrix-vector multiplications. By doing so, the impedance matrix is explicitly formed as one including both the selfand mutual-coupling parts, and the solver converges well for problems with considerable conductivity contrasts. The computational complexity in memory and CPU time for self-coupling matrix-vector multiplication are O(Nzq Nx Ny) and O(NzNx Ny log(NzNx Ny)) respectively, and for mutual-coupling matrix-vector multiplication are O(NpzpNzqNxNy) and O(NzpNzqNxNylog(NxNy)), respectively, for the proposed method, where Nx and Ny are the cell numbers of all the subdomains in the xand y-directions, and Nzp and Nzq the cell numbers of different subdomains in the z-direction. Several results of different subsurface sensing scenarios are presented to show the capabilities of this method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2944530","Advanced Energy Consortium; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8859621","Complex inhomogeneous objects;domain decomposition method;objects crossing multiple layers;stabilized biconjugate gradient fast Fourier transform (BCGS-FFT)","Nonhomogeneous media;Method of moments;Green's function methods;Three-dimensional displays;Integral equations;Antennas;Computational complexity","","12","","32","IEEE","4 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The solution is then computed using the marching-on-in-time (MOT) algorithm. The differentiated TD-EFIE has two problems: 1) the system matrix suffers from ill-conditioning when the time step increases (low frequency breakdown) and 2) it suffers from the DC instability, i.e., the formulation allows for the existence of spurious solenoidal currents that grow slowly in the solution.

Furthermore, at some layer interfaces, very thin surfaces such as good conductor surfaces and metasurfaces can be deposited to achieve desired properties such as high absorbance and/or anomalous reflection/refraction. In this article, the 3-D SNMM method is further extended from a single interface to multiple layers so that the electromagnetic propagation and scattering in the longitudinal direction is treated analytically through reflection and transmission matrices by using the eigenmode expansions in the transverse directions. Therefore, it effectively reduces the original 3-D problem into a series of 2-D eigenvalue problems for periodic structures. We apply this method to characterize metasurfaces and lithography models and show that the SNMM method is especially efficient when the longitudinal layer thicknesses are large compared with wavelength.

However, the THz propagation mechanisms differ in various ways from previously explored channels. In fact, reflections by a rough surface and diffuse scattering mechanisms are the most critical features contributing to spatial and temporal dispersion at THz frequencies. For this article, first, we develop a hybrid modeling approach of 3-D ray-tracing simulations in a realistic office room at 300 and 350 GHz to obtain estimates of the impact of surface roughness on the channel capacity which depends on generic channel characteristics. Then, the indoor multipath propagation and its impact on massive MIMO channels considering smooth and rough surfaces are investigated by employing the Beckmann-Kirchhoff (B-K) model. Finally, channel capacities of indoor THz massive MIMO channels with different surface roughnesses for both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) scenarios are calculated.

A generalized parametric prediction (GPP) model of Tmr for microwave slant paths in all-weather conditions is formulated and presented. The proposed GPP model is aimed at being multifrequency and surface-temperature scaled, valid for elevation angles from 5° to 90° and for frequencies ranging from 5 to 95 GHz within the three transmission windows delimited by the water vapor and the oxygen absorption peaks. The core of the GPP model is a parametrization driven by a physically based radiative transfer approach taking into account extinction, emission, and multiple scattering.

A frequency-domain full-wave (FDFW) numerical model is developed to simulate sferics propagation in earth ionosphere waveguide (EIWG). For a certain sampling frequency, EM fields of sferics are decomposed into a series of plane waves in the spectral domain via 2-D spatial Fourier transforms. The magnetized cold plasma medium of ionosphere is divided into several thin layers with the arbitrary anisotropic dielectric constant for each layer. The EM fields at the sferics receiver site are evaluated by recursively computing the reflection and transmission matrices in all layer boundaries for all the plane wave components and performing 2-D numerical integration in the spectral domain. The earth flattening technique is adopted and the horizontal wave vector of each plane wave component is directly modified in the spectral domain to compensate for earth curvature effects. Interactions between plane waves and the magnetized cold plasma of ionosphere are analyzed and discussed. Comparisons between the FDFW computation and finite-difference time-domain simulation as well as field measured sferics are implemented to verify the accuracy and reliability of the proposed new model.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2943433","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41504120); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8852820","Arbitrary anisotropic;D region remote sensing;earth flattening technique (EFT);ionosphere;magnetized cold plasma","Ionosphere;Computational modeling;Time-domain analysis;Plasmas;Finite difference methods;Mathematical model;Numerical models","","5","","42","IEEE","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A coherent Doppler radar operating at 340 MHz was deployed at the tip of Huangqi peninsula in the southeast coast of China to measure the echo spectrum from the actual sea surfaces. At the same time, an ocean buoy was placed in the radar coverage to monitor the sea states. The RCS and Doppler spectrum are analyzed and compared comprehensively between radar measurements and numerical predictions. After compensating the influence of wind direction, the responses of radar echo power and numerical predicted RCS to wind speed are basically consistent and are more sensitive in low sea states. The correlation of Doppler spectra between radar measurements and numerical simulations exceed 0.96 during the whole experiment.

Measurements were conducted in various scenarios such as R2R line-of-sight (LoS), R2R obstructed-LoS (OLoS), R2R reflected-non-LoS (RNLoS), R2R obstructed-RNLoS (ORNLoS), B2B RNLoS, B2B ORNLoS, and B2B LoS scenarios. In the aforementioned scenarios, we explored the impact of transmitter (Tx)/receiver (Rx) misalignment and obstructions such as cables, metal cabinets, and mesh structures on terahertz (THz) propagation, as well as feasibility of using existing metal objects as reflectors for NLoS links. For the R2R LoS scenario, an optical lens was used to extend the Tx-Rx separation distance. This led to a waveguide effect in the channels measured thereby resulting into a path loss exponent (PLE) of 1.48 with a shadowing gain of 0.7 dB. When obstructions of cables are present, ORNLoS link outperforms OLoS link with 2.5 dB lower shadowing gain and weaker multipath. Reflector in the RNLoS link has reflection coefficients very close to 1 for all incident angles. For the B2B scenario, a dual-reflector THz transceiver rack system is proposed to enable wireless links across vertically stacked servers and allow easy maintenance and repair of servers. The measured path loss closely follows the Friis values in the LoS link and in the RNLoS link with hollow vertical ground plane. When obstructions of cables are present, the ORNLoS link experiences 5-10 dB higher path loss and on average 0.25 GHz lower coherence bandwidth than the RNLoS link. The measured statistical channel properties show that the shadowing gain caused by cable clusters follows the log-normal distribution.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2949135","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1651273); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8889517","Channel characterization;channel sounding;terahertz (THz) propagation;wireless propagation in data centers","Data centers;Wireless communication;Servers;Metals;Communication cables;Lenses;Power cables","","49","","38","IEEE","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A significant reduction in the system size can then be obtained by looking for a pseudo-current, which is the actual surface current multiplied by the conjugate of the incident wave's phase function. This advantage is mostly lost when multiincidence problems have to be solved because, in addition to the source terms, the discretized operator must be recomputed for every new incidence. In this article, we make an explicit representation of the new operator as the sum of a conventional electric field integral equation (EFIE) which is independent of the direction of incidence, and an additional operator, which is dependent on the direction of incidence. The latter can be computed very efficiently such that a net performance gain is obtained with respect to the EFIE even for multiincidence problems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2948390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883294","Boundary integral equations;model reduction;plane wave scattering","Integral equations;Scattering;Perturbation methods;Antennas;Surface waves;Method of moments;Kernel","","2","","12","IEEE","25 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Contrary to the patch cell periodic array, a periodic array composed of square loop cells provides further compact structure. The feed system is a wideband aperture-coupled patch antenna, which is composed of square patch, ground plane with I-shaped slot, and fork-shaped feed network. This dual-arm feed network helps in obtaining the maximum gain at the center frequency. The superstrate with positive reflection coefficient phase provides the minimum gain at the resonant frequency. This in turn helps RCA in obtaining invariant gain in the operation band. Experimental verification was performed and the results show that this RCA offers fractional bandwidth of around 23.6% at X-band (8.88-11.25 GHz, S11 ≤ -10 dB) and gain (13.36-13.92 dBi) is almost invariant over the bandwidth. The measured patterns are symmetric with low cross-polarization levels.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2938589","Sichuan Science and Technology Supporting Project(grant numbers:2018GZ0260); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2018J081); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854298","Compact;partially reflective surface (PRS);resonant cavity antenna (RCA);wideband","Reflection coefficient;Wideband;Antenna feeds;Substrates;Dielectrics","","25","","22","IEEE","1 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As is well known, the frequency superposition of Bessel beams sharing the same axicon angle leads to the generation of tightly bounded wavepackets, namely X-waves, with remarkable spatio-temporal confinement properties. In the nondispersive case, the axicon angle does not change with frequency, and these features can be predicted by closed-form expressions. Remarkably, it is found that the volumetric confinement of such pulses can be optimized for a specific axicon angle. Since the geometric metrics do not account for the unavoidable presence of energy tails outside the main spot, energy metrics are here introduced and compared with the purely geometric definition. Finally, the dispersive case is investigated, accounting for the typical wavenumber dispersion of radial waveguides. As a result, the axicon angle changes with the frequency, and fundamental limits exist for the maximum theoretical fractional bandwidth. Interestingly, design criteria based on approximate analytical expressions are derived to optimize the confinement, even in the dispersive case.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2938628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8826590","Bessel beams;diffraction;dispersion;localized waves;near-field focusing;radial waveguides;X-waves","Dispersion;Measurement;Apertures;Bandwidth;Electromagnetic waveguides;Focusing","","20","","25","IEEE","6 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to properly demonstrate the practical consequences of these omissions, we provide simulation results as well as experimental validation using a prototype with the exact dimensions as in [1], fed with an ultrawideband coupler [2], as shown in Fig. 1. Radavaram and Pour [1] have claimed 68% fractional bandwidth for a multiport antenna based only on a single-port input reflection coefficient (S11). Unfortunately, the mutual coupling between the antenna ports (S21) is not shown in their article. We have performed corresponding simulations using Ansys HFSS and found that the missing coupling coefficient between the elements within the band of interest has a magnitude close to 0 dB, which is validated by the experimental results, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). This suggests that the proposed design is operating as a wideband bandpass filter in lieu of a radiating element. The clear misunderstanding in the scattering performance arises from the fact that for dual-port antennas fed by in-phase and out-of-phase inputs, the active scattering parameters are of fundamental importance. Active scattering parameters for dual-port devices are defined as the combinations of S11 and S21 (some references, such as [4] and [5], use differential and common mode scattering parameters or Sdd and Scc). They determine the overall scattering performance when a feeding network is connected to a multiport antenna. For instance, [3] (see [1, Ref. 20]), [4], and [5] are aimed at reducing Sdd11 to below −10 dB for the differential S-parameter. They use the correct definition of Sdd11, as given in the following [3, eq.

In this correspondence, we would like to address the aforementioned parameters, which were simply overlooked in [2], by slightly modifying the antenna structure in [2]. The resultant antenna is now capable of radiating both the broadside and conical patterns over a 45% active impedance bandwidth, which is still much greater than that of the microstrip patch antennas with reconfigurable radiation patterns reported in [3]–[13]. The modifications to [2] to improve the isolation between the two ports include incorporating an H-shaped stub, inspired by the one in [14], at the center of the patch, as shown in Fig. 1(a), and placing shorting vias at appropriate positions on the antenna, which extends from the top layer of the patch to the ground plane. These vias, along with the narrow slits at the center of the patch, considerably aided in reducing the mutual coupling between the probes. The H-shaped stub and the shorting vias on it facilitated in improving the impedance matching. In the interest of maximizing the overall active reflection coefficients of both the modes of operation, i.e., SUM and DIFFERENCE modes, L-shaped probes are used to excite the antenna structure in lieu of the SMA probes. To integrate the L-probes, the profile of the antenna is now increased from  $\sim 0.02\lambda _{\mathrm {d}}$  to  $\sim 0.08\lambda _{\mathrm {d}}$ , where  $\lambda _{\mathrm {d}}$  is the dielectric wavelength at the center frequency of operation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2955215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917924","","Antenna radiation patterns;Microstrip antennas;Antenna measurements;Patch antennas;Probes","","6","","14","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
