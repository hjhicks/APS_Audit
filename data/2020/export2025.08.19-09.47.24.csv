The dipole antenna is created by extending the outer and inner conductors of the coaxial cable. One dipole arm is a helical outer conductor encompassing the other arm that is the extended inner conductor. The overall lengths of the helix and the extended inner conductor are three quarters and one quarter of a wavelength, respectively. The helix's current direction reverses a quarter of a wavelength away from the feed point, becoming aligned with the extended inner conductor's current. This creates a relatively low-input impedance, choking the current on the outer surface of the outer conductor. The fields produced by the currents flowing on the dipole arms destructively interfere closer to the feed point, while constructively interfering further from it. This helps the antenna produce nearly spherical ablation zones. A 1.9 GHz prototype of the antenna was fabricated and its ablation performance was experimentally verified in egg white. Measurement results showed good agreement with the simulations and confirmed the antenna's effectiveness in generating localized ablation zones. Our proposed design can serve as a promising candidate for performing minimally invasive ablation therapy within flexible and maneuverable embodiments.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2978868","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1406090); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9034485","Interstitial antennas;microwave ablation (MWA);microwave hyperthermia","Dipole antennas;Conductors;Coaxial cables;Feeds;Microwave antennas;Helical antennas","","32","","30","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The DN is composed of 2 two-way unequal WPDs, three transmission lines (TLs), and two reactive components. Two techniques are introduced for the wideband performance: 1) by using the WPD with high output isolation, the antenna matching becomes independent of antenna decoupling. So, the decoupled antennas with the proposed DN could perform broad impedance bandwidths without using matching networks and 2) the DN is designed to minimize antennas' coupling coefficients at two frequencies, which collectively contribute to a broader decoupling bandwidth. In addition, rigorous design formulas are presented along with systematic design procedures. Based on this, the TL lengths and component reactances can be precisely calculated instead of being fitted to achieve high antenna isolation. Two decoupling cases using the proposed DN and its simplified model are presented and compared to give an intuitive illustration of the wideband mechanism. The measurement results for decoupling case #1 show that a very wide isolation bandwidth of 23.7%, total efficiency over 65%, and the envelope correlation coefficients (ECCs) less than 0.05 can be achieved simultaneously using the proposed DN.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2981679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9046280","Decoupling network (DN);isolation;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna;mutual coupling (MC);wideband;Wilkinson power divider (WPD)","Wideband;Couplings;MIMO communication;Broadband antennas;Power dividers","","67","","42","IEEE","24 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By exploring a capacitive blind-via fence near the radiating apertures, the field is concentrated between the fence and ground, achieving obvious dimension miniaturization and wide beamwidth for regular dual-polarized microstrip antennas. The proposed blind-via fence is constituted by four rows of metallic wires with subwavelength diameter, period, and gap to the ground. Thanks to the field concentration brought by the blind-via fence, high isolation is realized by suppressing the radiation from the feeding probes, similar to two disk-loaded monopole antennas, and forcing the fundamental mode of the patch. To validate the proposed concept, a prototype is fabricated and characterized with the size of 0.19 λ0 × 0.19 λ0 × 0.07λ0 (λ0 is the free-space wavelength at the center frequency).

Besides, four additional shorted patches are added beside the cross-shaped driven patch to introduce another radiation null at the lower band edge. Moreover, by embedding a cross-shaped strip between these four stacked patches, the third radiation null is generated to further suppress the upper stopband. As a result, a quasi-elliptic bandpass response is realized without requiring extra filtering circuit. For demonstration, a prototype was fabricated with standard PCB process and measured.

In our design, a section of SIW operating around its cutoff frequency imitates the ENZ host, while a high-permittivity dielectric block is “doped” into the SIW to control the overall field distributions, achieving a sharp 180° phase shift of electric field at the predesigned half- wavelength resonance. Owing to the infinite wavelength in the ENZ medium, the operating frequency of the proposed antenna is irrelevant to its length. In this way, the broadside radiation of the proposed antenna allows to be configured at the same frequency via simply altering the length of the SIW, i.e., the spacing between two radiating apertures. Systematic studies show that the directivity of the proposed antenna can be manipulated over a range from around 6 dBi to almost 10 dBi, along with the half-power beamwidth reduced from 110° to 20°, for the length of the antenna varying from $0.2\lambda _{0}$ ($\lambda _{0}$ is the wavelength in free space at 5.5 GHz) to $1.2\lambda _{0}$ .","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2977746","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771280); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Manipulate(grant numbers:4182029); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program(grant numbers:2019Z08QCX16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028074","Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) medium;flexible antennas;photonic doping;radiation pattern;zero-order resonance","Resonant frequency;Electric fields;Apertures;Dielectrics;Antenna radiation patterns;Cutoff frequency","","15","","43","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are still some unsolved challenges in the implementation of this system in real-world applications. One of the crucial challenges in chipless RFID systems is the effect of the dynamic environment and the effect of the attached item on the tag response, which causes interference in the tag ID measurement process. One approach to solve this problem at the tag design level is to use cross-polar chipless RFID tags, which conventionally are orientation-sensitive. However, even though it is desirable to detect the tag ID in different orientations (in 2-D at least) for practical applications, having both cross-polar RCS and orientation insensitivity in a tag is a challenge. Therefore, in this article, a technique to develop cross-polar resonators and unit cells that display a consistent reflection regardless of tag orientations is proposed. The results of the simulation and measurement of a few samples of the proposed tags are depicted to demonstrate the feasibility of using the proposed tags in a system with reflective items in the background. Five cross-polar structures with low sensitivity to orientation are introduced in this article. Among all structures, the flower-shaped unit cell provides a very consistent cross-polar response at different rotational angles with a maximum of 11 dB peak RCS variation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2975639","Australian Research Council’s Linkage Grant (Discreet Reading of Printable Multi-Bit Chipless RFID Tags on Polymer Banknotes)(grant numbers:LP130101044); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016371","Chipless RFID tag;cross-polar RCS;orientation-insensitive;polarized;resonator;unit cell","Resonators;Reflection;RFID tags;Antenna measurements;Antennas;Strips","","50","","29","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each subarray consists of one directly fed antenna element and several passive reactive-loaded elements. The proposed overlapping scheme exploits a free-space reactive coupling instead of more conventional schemes based on complex beamforming networks. This results in a drastic reduction in the number of waveguide components required in the feeding network. The optimization of the considered class of array structures using a full-wave electromagnetic (EM) solver is extremely time-consuming even in the presence of subarrays with a reduced number of passive elements. To overcome this limitation, an effective semi-analytical design algorithm has been specifically developed. Using this algorithm, a novel subarray structure with a predefined pulse-shaped radiation pattern was synthesized. The designed subarray is inherently matched and features reduced spurious EM coupling level with adjacent subarray elements. In particular, the analysis of an array consisting of 38 such subarray elements has been carried out with the main goal of illustrating the effect of the subarray pattern on the total array characteristics. To validate the subarray overlapping scheme, an array composed of three contiguous subarrays has been realized and measured experimentally.

Designing the BBSF network without using baluns at input and output paths of the network results in the compact and low-loss feeding network, while maintaining the common-mode suppression feature. Furthermore, to have a planar BBSF network, microstrip crossovers are utilized to avoid the use of multilayer PCB design, resulting in the elegant transfer of intersecting RF signals.

Nevertheless, the beampattern of an FDA is not only range-angle-dependent but also time variant when only considering the transmit procedure. In this article, an enhanced transmit-receive beamforming approach is proposed to achieve the time-invariant and symmetrical beampattern with only a single maximum value in range-angle space. First, two FDAs with symmetric logarithmically increasing frequency offsets (SLFOs) are proposed to achieve a maximum value at the desired range-angle region while exhibiting sidelobe in the region out of interest. Second, the receive procedure is devised to compensate the time-variant terms with multiple mixers corresponding to different frequencies. To maintain the shape of the mainbeam and simultaneously reduce the peak sidelobe level (PSLL) of the pattern, the optimization problem is constructed into a semidefinite programming problem. Numerical results show that both of the two proposed FDAs exhibit fine focused, symmetrically distributed transmit-receive beampatterns in range and angle domains.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2977717","Outstanding Youth Science Fund of Xi’an University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2019YQ3-14); Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61901357); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028091","Enhanced beamforming;frequency diverse array (FDA);low sidelobe level;semidefinite programming;transmit–receive mode","Array signal processing;Frequency diversity;Frequency modulation;Transmitting antennas;Phased arrays;Receivers","","34","","33","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A rigorous mathematical derivation is used for the generation of closed-form expressions of the mean-valued radiation characteristics. The numerical simulations are performed using both ANSYS HFSS and MATLAB using a finite-element distribution. To validate the analytical models, we include the measured results of a uniformly distributed ring array topology, constrained to a set of 18 elements and a uniformly distributed shell array topology constrained to 16 elements. The results of all methods are compared to demonstrate exceptional agreement in the recommended theoretical analysis. This process follows differently from traditional phased array nulling methods, which apply the unique amplitude tapers along individual phased array elements. Unlike typical adaptive beamforming algorithms, this process does not require the estimation of second-order statistical metrics and avoids expansions of large polynomial equations. It uses shared aperture characteristics in order to generate null beams simultaneously. This can also be extended to widen null widths from the compounding of these shared aperture distributions, which is shown in simulation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2978887","Naval Information Warfare Center-Pacific, San Diego, CA, USA; Army Research Office and the Science, Mathematics And Research (SMART) Scholarship for Service program(grant numbers:W911NF-09-1-0429); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9034474","ad hoc wireless networks;aperiodic array;collaborative beamforming;cooperative beamforming;distributed beamforming;wireless sensor network","Array signal processing;Apertures;Finite element analysis;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays;Closed-form solutions;Mathematical model","","7","","50","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Realizing progressively shifted beams angularly in space by controlling the slot geometry of each antenna, the multiport LWA becomes sensitive to a large finite angular sector. Using this architecture, a unique mapping between the angle of arrival (AoA) and the port locations is achieved. Using detailed full-wave simulations, the DF operation of the slot-based LWA is successfully demonstrated for several examples involving single and multiple signals illuminating the antenna. It is demonstrated that the AoA can be determined by measuring the received power at each of the ports and the known radiation patterns of the LWAs.

These closed-form expressions are very straightforward and combine two terms. The first term involves the derivative with respect to frequency of the reactance. This term is known since long to be related to the reactive energy of a radiating system. The second term is new and involves the product of the resistance and a time duration that is characteristic for the considered radiator. This second term shows two very important properties. First, it makes the total expressions semidefinite, and second, it is negligible for small lossless radiators. It is proved that for structures with highly separated resonances, the concept of recoverable energy is strongly linked to the calculation procedure for Q based on the frequency derivative of the impedance.

However, a central energy hollow exists in the OAM-carrying beam, and its radius varies with the OAM mode values, which is the main bottleneck in the radio frequency OAM applications. This article proposes a solution to eliminate the central hollow, by fundamentally changing the transmitted signal of the uniform circular array (UCA). To generate the unidirectional beam pattern, defined as the beaming OAM (BOAM), the orthogonal waveforms are radiated by UCA with an equidifferent initial phase. The BOAM wave can be received by one single antenna, and the separate OAM mode demodulation is then achieved based on the waveform diversity. This article studies the theoretical model of the BOAM field distribution and shows that the waveform diversity among distributed units can not only alter the doughnut-like shape into the closed beam, but also maintain the intact vortex characteristic. On this basis, the extended OAM mode multiplexing system is designed with one single UCA. A 16-element UCA is shown to be capable of generating 15 OAM modes simultaneously, with all modes superposing on the same direction. Furthermore, it is verified by the simulation that the vortex phase of each single mode can be precisely extracted from the OAM-mode-multiplexing signal.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2981724","Postdoctoral Innovation Talent Support Program; National Defense Foundation of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)(grant numbers:B18039); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61525105); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601340,61901344); National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2019JQ-289); New Teacher Innovation of Xidian University(grant numbers:XJS18002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099589","Beam convergency;beaming orbital angular momentum (BOAM);electromagnetic vortex (EMV) wave;OAM;waveform diversity","Antenna arrays;Multiplexing;MIMO communication;Orbits;Beams;Electromagnetic scattering","","15","","37","IEEE","25 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with conventional 1 bit reflective metasurfaces, the proposed scheme alleviates the inherent limitation of single-beam patterns on 1 bit reflective metasurfaces under normally incident plane waves. To verify the proposed scheme, a 1 bit unit cell is designed with a 180°±25° phase difference between the two states for frequencies ranging from 34.3 to 49.9 GHz, and a layer-stacking method is proposed to achieve two prephases with a 90° phase difference.

In the proposed approach, the domain decomposition between the interior spectral-element domain and the outer surface BI domain enables the BI domain to be solved by a far more efficient spectral integral method using a uniform mesh; without any loss of generality, it leaves the interior spectral-element domain with flexibility to model any inhomogeneous objects. For the BI domain, with a uniform mesh and rooftop basis functions, we can exploit the Toeplitz structure of the BI matrices with the fast Fourier transform algorithm and apply the Calderón preconditioner to achieve a high iteration convergence rate that will not slow down as the problem gets larger. With the periodic layered medium Green's functions, the layers without objects can be treated as background and the discretization is avoided. We show that this method is very promising for large-scale problems, because the CPU time and memory required with respect to the number of unknowns grow slowly. We validate this method with a commercial finite element solver and show its ability by solving a large-scale optical lithography problem.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2976584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9024232","Calder??n preconditioner;doubly periodic structure;finite-element boundary-integral (FEBI) method;periodic layered medium Green???s functions (PLMGFs);spectral-element spectral-integral (SESI) method","Numerical analysis;Integral equations;Boundary conditions;Periodic structures;Green's function methods;Antennas;Magnetic domains","","12","","29","IEEE","4 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The observable field concept provides a methodology to evaluate the maximum power that could be received by an ideal terminal antenna. In particular, it emerges that to maximize the received power, the pattern in transmission of the antenna should be synthesized to reproduce the angular pattern of the observable field. This is specifically relevant in cases of non-line of sight (NLOS) at high frequencies, where the power received can drop by orders of magnitude.

A basic distance-dependent path loss model with a Gaussian random variance for shadow fading is utilized in accordance with the maximum-power directional and omnidirectional measurement data, therein exploiting significant path loss exponents in the presence of vegetation. In comparison with the existing ITU-R and 3GPP models, the effect of dense-leaved trees on path loss prediction is similar to that of buildings, whereas these standard models are inapplicable for sparse obstacle-line-of-sight (OLoS) links. Consequently, an azimuth-angle-based path loss characterization is proposed considering the antenna pattern, beam misalignment, and blockage effects. Moreover, several composite and cluster-level small-scale channel parameters, such as the number of clusters, delay spread, and angular spread, are extracted. Analysis of the first-arrival cluster in the OLoS setting reveals that forward scattering through foliage is still dominant and is expected to produce a larger azimuth angular spread of the arrival and compact multipath components in the time domain compared with line-of-sight and reflected clusters.

A direct numerical computation may not be efficient and cannot provide a robust and accurate result especially for highly conductive media and/or antennas located near the surface. Two complete asymptotic series are formulated for the integral, which is a power series of the reciprocal of the distance between the source and observation point. The asymptotic series are nonuniform, so the application of the series is limited and is not accurate for the aforementioned cases. Hence, in this article, a new uniform asymptotic expansion of the integral is derived, which is represented in terms of repeated integrals of the complementary error function. The representation is very similar to the conventional uniform expansion of the integral. However, the formulated expansion is a complete power series of the reciprocal of the distance, while the conventional series contains only the first-order term. For a far-field region, the proposed expansion is mathematically shown to reduce the known complete nonuniform expansion for the first few terms of the expansion. For some scenarios that include near-earth propagation and/or highly conductive media, the proposed formulation is numerically verified and its mathematical properties are examined.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2976486","INHA University Research Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9024215","Complete uniform evaluation;impedance plane;Sommerfeld integral","Impedance;Dielectrics;Antennas;Surface impedance;Permittivity;Surface waves;Media","","6","","21","IEEE","4 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One downside of OAM radio communication is the requirement of multimode radio frequency (RF) hardware at both ends of a link, i.e., the transmitter and the receiver. This is not always practically viable, especially as we move toward low-profile receivers in future communication devices. In this work, we present a novel method of OAM-based radio communication with enhanced physical layer security that requires only a single-antenna receiver. We first present the system architecture, then we design and realize a Rotman lens-based circular antenna array transmitter operating at 5.8 GHz. We then experimentally verify the capability of the hardware to create multiple modes. As a proof-of-concept, we propose a communication system that simultaneously uses modes 0 and +1 of the OAM beamformer and in doing so show how a single-antenna receiver can be used for data recovery. We first identify a general analog modulation expression and use the proposed system to transmit digitally modulated data stream to a single-antenna-equipped receiver.

The exploitation ability of ABC is further enhanced by integrating with butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), denoted as butterfly-integrated ABC (BiABC). The performance of BiABC is well verified through three multiobjective benchmark functions. A triple-objective electromagnetic (EM) model is constituted, which involves the total reflection (TR), total thickness (TT), and number of layers (NL). Pareto optimality is employed to explore the global optimal designs within the three-dimensional objective space by simultaneously determining the design variables for synchronously minimizing the three objectives by assuring tradeoff among the objectives. The model is verified via a full-wave EM simulator.

In this article, we propose an imaging algorithm that corrects for errors that typically arise at the boundary of an ablation image when the tissue's dielectric properties are a little affected by ablation. Conventional imaging algorithms exploit the difference in the propagation time of signals through nonablated and ablated tissues in order to monitor the dimensions of an ablation in real time, but this time difference does not account for the drop in conductivity that occurs as the tissue dries out, causing nonnegligible errors, particular in lower ablation impact case. In order to address this problem, the method that we propose incorporates waveform reconstruction in accounting for the change in conductivity. We test this method with 2-D and 3-D numerical simulations of microwave signals propagating in two computational phantoms of breast tissue with different densities. Simulations with differently affected tissues show that the proposed method improves upon the accuracy of conventional MWA monitoring techniques, with an acceptable increase in the computation time.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2972633","MIC/SCOPE(grant numbers:162103102); Strategic Information and Communications Research and Development Promotion Program (SCOPE) promoted by the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications(grant numbers:162103102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999811","Microwave ablation (MWA);microwave-based ablation dimension monitoring;time difference of arrival (TDOA);waveform reconstruction","Monitoring;Permittivity;Microwave theory and techniques;Electromagnetic heating;Microwave imaging;Conductivity","","17","","27","IEEE","14 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resonant frequency of the first TM10 mode decreases with narrowing of either the center or side gaps; the resonant frequency of the antiphase TM20 mode is hardly affected by the center gap width but decreases while reducing the side gap width. The miniaturization of the metasurface antenna is therefore achieved by narrowing the side gaps, and the wide bandwidth with good impedance matching is realized by widening the center gap.

Compared to uniform array antennas, the impedance and gain bandwidths were greatly increased, and the SLL and front-to-back (F/B) ratio characteristics were improved. The proposed array antenna had an |S11| <; -10 dB, an impedance bandwidth of 23.3-51.0 GHz, and a 3 dB gain bandwidth of 22.0-44.0 GHz. At 28 GHz, the E- and H-plane SLLs of the proposed array antenna were -24.1 and -18.8 dB, respectively.

Due to the characteristics of in-band transmission and out-of-band absorption, FSR is considered as a candidate for stealth radome. By breaking through the technical barrier of traditional FSR transmission windows design, we implement a double lossy layers FSR for the first time in public reports. The FSR is configured by cascading two lossy layers above a lossless layer with two air spaces to separate them. It has two independent absorption bands, which are provided by their lossy layers, respectively. Therefore, it has a broader bandwidth and more stable absorption characteristics. We adopted the equivalent circuit model (ECM), surface current distribution, and loss distribution to comprehend the physical mechanism of the FSR. We fabricated and measured the FSR prototypes to validate the proposed design. The simulated results show that the transmission is -0.78 dB at 6.3 GHz, and the -10 dB reflection is 2.5-14.6 GHz. The measured results achieve a significant agreement with the simulated results. Under the universal guideline, new FSR could do better in terms of absorption bandwidth and scattering stability.

This makes the algorithm more efficient and flexible for analysis of multiscale and large-scale composite structures in comparison with the traditional Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) integral equation combined with the EFIE.
