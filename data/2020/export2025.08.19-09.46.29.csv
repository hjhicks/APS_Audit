The difference between the phase velocities of two PP orthogonal modes is used to obtain CP fields. The two orthogonal modes are excited by an inclined slot fabricated on the ground plane that connects the two PPs. By tuning the slot length, the impedance can be easily matched. To reduce the cross-polarized fields, a modified CP PP antenna with semicircular plates is introduced. ANSYS HFSS was used to simulate the antennas and prototypes were fabricated to verify the simulations. Both the original and modified CP PP antennas have an overlapping antenna bandwidth of ~13.0% and an antenna gain of ~8 dBic. As compared with other broad-beam antennas, the two PP antennas have simpler and larger structures, easing their fabrications especially at millimeter-wave frequencies.

Initially, the nonbroadside |E0| component of the traditional SPA at TM1/2,2 mode is demonstrated to be much larger than its broadside |Eφ| component in H-plane or yoz plane radiation patterns. In order to maintain its peak radiation in the normal direction, the far-zone radiated fields of the antenna are theoretically studied and analyzed. The results demonstrate that the dual nodal lines of the TM1/2,2 modal fields could be gradually moved far away from each other by increasing the stub length. As such, its |Eφ| and |E0| components in H-plane or yoz plane radiation patterns could be progressively strengthened and weakened, respectively. After that, by reallocating these dual nodal lines around the corners of the radiating patch, the nonbroadside radiated fields of TM1/2,2 mode are successfully transformed into the broadside radiation, while keeping a low H-plane cross-polarization level. Additionally, the symmetric open-ended stubs are folded so as to reduce the dimensions of the core radiator. In final, the proposed SPA is fabricated and measured. Simulated and measured results are found in good agreement with each other, and both of them illustrate that the antenna has satisfactorily acquired a normal radiation pattern at reshaped TM1/2,2 mode. Most importantly, its high H-plane cross-polarization is dramatically reduced from -4.3 to -21.4 dB as compared to the traditional SPA at TM1/2,0 mode.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2938742","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801348,61571468,61601338); Shaanxi Province Program(grant numbers:2018022); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:1018/10251180002); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2019JM-201,2019JM-489); Universidade de Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00007-FST,MYRG2018-00073-FST,CPG2019-00024-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8826601","Cross-polarization reduction;open-ended stubs;shorted patch antenna (SPA)","Antenna radiation patterns;Electromagnetic compatibility;Electric fields;Patch antennas;Antenna measurements;Resonant frequency","","40","","29","IEEE","6 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The concept is to synthesize a unique electromagnetic field distribution using four vertically stacked SIWs. In particular, a uniquely adjusted excitation of magnitudes and phases of the four SIWs is employed as the feeding of the SIW horn, emulating the field distribution of pyramidal horn antennas. This approach realizes the phase correction of the electric field at the horn aperture and concentrates the radiation to the endfire direction to reduce the sidelobes. To prove the concept, a stacked dielectric loaded SIW horn antenna fed by four TE10 excitations was simulated at 35 GHz, yielding a gain of 15 dBi, an HPBW of 33° for both the E-plane and H-plane, and an SLL of approximately -24 dB for both the E-plane and H-plane. To achieve the desired excitation at each port, a narrowband SIW power splitter was designed to adapt a 3.5 mm coaxial connector to the four waveguide ports with the required phase shift.

Antenna redesign for various operating bands is clearly more difficult yet practically important because intentional reduction of the bandwidth (e.g., by moving the lower edge of the operating band up in frequency) may lead to a considerable size reduction, which can be beneficial for specific application areas. This article proposes a rigorous approach to rapid redesign of miniaturized CP antennas involving inverse surrogate models and fast electromagnetic (EM)-based parameter tuning. Our methodology allows for a precise control of the lower operating frequency of the CP antenna (both in terms of the impedance and AR bandwidth) and accomplishing the geometry parameter scaling at an extremely low cost of a few EM analyses of the structure at hand. Our methodology is demonstrated by redesigning a compact wide slot CP antenna in the range of 3.2-5.8 GHz. The proposed approach can be used for fast rendering of the bandwidth/size tradeoffs (the footprints obtained for the verification structure range from 783 to 482 mm2), thus determining the most suitable designs for particular applications.

By introducing two pairs of symmetrical meandering conductors to connect both ends of the radiating cross slots, a compact-size antenna with wide bandwidth can be achieved. By further adopting an artificial magnetic conductor-backed (AMC) reflector that is arranged below the radiating patches with a distance of 6 mm, the antenna profile can be reduced from 0.25λc to 0.13λc (where λc is the freespace wavelength at the center frequency), while both the gain and frequency bandwidth are also enhanced. Furthermore, owing to the orthogonal differentially fed structure, the antenna element displays a high port isolation of 37 dB. Finally, by meticulously designing the feeding network, much narrower beamwidth can be yielded, and hence, the unidirectional gain is further improved. The measured results show that a lower-frequency bandwidth of 13.5% (3.26-3.73 GHz) with a gain of 15.7 ± 0.1 dBi and upper-frequency bandwidth of 7.6% (4.68-5.05 GHz) with 15.55 ± 0.05 dBi gain can be obtained by the proposed antenna array.

A slot-loaded substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW)-based LWA is first explored to attain CP performance with continuous beam scanning through broadside. This CP LWA realizes a measured CP performance with a 3 dB gain variance within 2.75-3.35 GHz for scan angles ranging from -28.6° to +31.5°. A row of shorted stubs is then incorporated into the CP LWA to obtain similar LP performance.

The reported approach is not restricted to laboratory environments, does not suffer from integration drift and line-of-sight, and does not impede natural movement. Our previous work introduced wrap-around coils that addressed the challenges above but were limited to monitoring joint flexion. In contrast, a new class of ESLAs is herewith proposed, placed longitudinally across the joint, and operated at 34 MHz to monitor both flexion and rotation. An added advantage versus our previous design is a remarkable improvement in flexion angle resolution: the transmission coefficient dynamic range for 0° - 100° flexion improves by 18.8 dB in this article. Two ESLAs are shown to accurately detect flexion/rotation for angular resolutions up to 10°. However, if higher resolution is desired, ambiguities arise. To tackle this, a three-ESLA system with integrated post-processing is proposed that achieves resolution as high as 2°. Simulations and in vitro experiments are in excellent agreement. Guidelines for system design suited to diverse applications are discussed, and conformance with safety standards is ensured. In future, ESLAs can be seamlessly integrated in garments, enabling transformative benefits to healthcare, sports, and beyond.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2935147","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1842531); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805248","Bioelectromagnetics;electrically small loop antenna (ESLA);joint flexion and rotation;wearables","Monitoring;Receivers;Biomedical monitoring;Coils;Transmitting antennas","","28","","26","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, that design suffered from the drawbacks of large geometry and limited angular range. To overcome these limitations, here a broadband gradient metasurface based on geometric phase theory is loaded in front of the prism to customize the radiation angle and reduce the total prism size. In addition, a novel ridged gap waveguide is employed to improve the linearity of LWA dispersion, which is beneficial to maintain the bandwidth of LWA with reduced size. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the excellent performance of the designed antennas. One antenna radiates at an angle of 39.5° in a squint-free bandwidth of 20%, but the prism size is decreased to a quarter of the original one, while the other realizes a broadside radiation with a squint-free bandwidth of 18%.

As part of the loop, a partially air-filled dual-mode substrate integrated waveguide cavity with a dielectric-loaded broadside slot is designed to realize the functions of resonators, harmonic diplexers, and antennas concurrently. The radiator oscillates at a fundamental frequency which is set by the first mode of the cavity resonator, and the generated second harmonic signal is extracted and radiated by the diplexer and antenna functions, respectively. Self-isolation is achieved because a pulling signal is attenuated by the synergetic effect of the reverse isolation and harmonic separation of the loop amplifier and diplexer, respectively. Measured results of a fabricated prototype show a maximum equivalent isotropic radiated power of 15 dBm at 28.15 GHz and a phase noise of -108 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset.

A quasi-transverse electromagnetic (TEM) guided wave is predicted using the dispersion relation curve obtained from the equivalent circuit, and it is proven that the calculated curve is in good agreement with the eigen mode simulations and measured trajectory of the scan blind angle, for different frequencies. Next, slits and stubs are introduced as parasitic structures to eliminate the scan blindness and improve the antenna scan range. To confirm the effects of these parasitic elements, a linear array simulation is performed, which confirms the suppression of a quasi-TEM guided wave.

To experimentally verify the feasibility of the proposed design, a wideband enhanced I/Q time modulator and its corresponding eight-element ESTMPA are designed and manufactured. A detailed study on the effect of the magnitude and phase deviations in the circuit and the transition period of modulating pulse are presented. The measured results of power spectrum and radiation pattern have a good agreement with the simulated ones.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2938711","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801223); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8826616","In-phase/quadrature (I/Q) complex modulation;reconfigurable power divider;single-sideband time-modulated phased array (STMPA);time modulated array (TMA)","Amplitude modulation;Harmonic analysis;Switches;Phased arrays;Phase shifters;Power dividers","","78","","23","IEEE","6 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the radiation state, a truncated patch resonator on the bottom layer is fed by a coaxial probe so as to produce CP wave, and it further excites the slots on the upper layer, resulting in its radiation toward free space, and when the antenna at the stealth state, the detective incident wave can be effectively absorbed outside the radiation band, thus achieving RCS reduction.

These techniques are used to generate CP along with a high level of directivity over a broad bandwidth. The main aim here is to propose a multifunctional antenna with the high radiation properties and the capability of power harvesting, simultaneously. To harvest power using a solar panel, the transparency requirement should be satisfied. Hence, the proposed design is sputtered with the thin layer of indium-tin-oxide (ITO) with a thickness of 200 nm. However, it seems to be sacrificed a large amount of conductivity at the frequency band of interest (x-band). Correspondingly, the performance of conductivity and transparency for both the materials of ITO and copper (Cu) as coated on the proposed design is determined. Alternatively, as an optically transparent conductor (OTC), a combination of both coating layers, including ITO and Cu with thicknesses of 200 and 5 nm, respectively, is applied.

Due to the strong coupling between antenna elements, the active element pattern (AEP) and active reflection coefficient (ARC) are included in the proposed approach in order to evaluate the overall mutual coupling and port matching. Specifically, a nonconvex programming problem in terms of the given maximum sidelobe level (SLL), the ARC or reflected power at the center frequency, and the given maximum sideband level (SBL) at sidebands is established. After the application of some mathematical transformations, the nonconvex programming problem is decomposed into a convex optimization problem at the center frequency and an iterative convex problem (ICP) at sidebands.

Attenuation at both frequencies and hydrometeor properties [rainfall rate and drop size distribution (DSD)] are measured simultaneously. The measured DSD is fit with gamma and Weibull distributions and is also compared to the frequently used distribution Marshall and Palmer (MP) model; Weibull is shown to be a better fit to the measured DSDs. Theoretical prediction of attenuation as a function of rainfall rate (up to about 20 mm/h) is determined using Mie scattering theory, and the fit gamma and Weibull, and MP distribution models; as well as using the International Telecommunications Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) recommendation. The calculations are evaluated by comparing them to the experiment. The measured results at 77 GHz best agree with the ITU-R recommendation whereas at 300 GHz, the calculation based on Mie scattering and the Weibull distribution exhibits the best fit to the measured data. The measured data that exceed the theoretical prediction are analyzed and interpreted based on their corresponding observed drop size properties, for the first time.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2938735","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/L019078/1); Jaguar Land Rover Plc.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8826596","Drop size distribution (DSD);low-terahertz (Low-THz);rain attenuation;wave propagation","Attenuation;Rain;Attenuation measurement;Frequency measurement;Size measurement;Velocity measurement;Measurement by laser beam","","96","","40","IEEE","6 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is well suited for applications where the launch direction of the radio wave ray is unknown, but the position of the receiver is specified instead. Iterative transformation of a candidate path to the sought-for ray is guided by a generalized force, where the definition of the force depends on the ray type. For high rays, the negative gradient of the optical path functional is used. For low rays, the transformation of the gradient is applied, converting the neighborhood of a saddle point to that of a local minimum. Knowledge about the character of the rays is used to establish a scheme for systematic identification of all relevant rays between the given points, without the need to provide an accurate initial estimate for each solution. Various applications of the method to isotropic ionosphere demonstrate its ability to resolve complex ray configurations including 3-D propagation and multi-path propagation where rays are close in the launch direction.

The derived method needs the shape and position information of scatterers a-priorly to model the targets as circular cylinders (i.e., an effective radius and center is determined for each target) with constant electrical parameters. Next, the method employs the virtual experiments to focus the incident magnetic field as a J0 on a specific target. After focusing the excitation and neglecting the multiple scattering between targets, the scattered field is in H1(1) form. Next, the error between the simulated and the virtual fields is calculated. Then, the effective electrical parameter is estimated as the minimizer of the error. Lastly, for the cases where the shape and/or position information are noisy, the introduced method links the deviation of the electrical parameters to deviations of the effective radius and center. From this relation, the method presents a way to estimate the maximum deviations in the electrical parameters, given the maximum deviations in effective radius and center.

The device and its custom transmitter are prototyped and optimized to show efficient wireless power transfer and stent heating through in vitro tests. The inductive stent with its helical pattern is gold coated to achieve a 3.5× higher quality (Q) factor, improving heating performance of the device. The combinational use of independent resonant antennas with the power antenna is found to significantly boost stent temperature by up to 96% with an intermediate tissue layer. Upon matching the frequencies at which the Q factors of the inductive stent, power antenna, and booster antenna are peaked, the stent excited through 10 mm-thick tissue exhibits a temperature increase of 18 °C, well over a necessary level for targeted hyperthermia treatment.

Common practice in numerical analysis and testing is to utilize radiation efficiency (RE) measures external to the tissue phantom employed. This approach means that RE is also dependent on the phantom used and antenna positioning, making it difficult to understand antenna performance and minimize near-field tissue losses. Therefore, an alternative methodology for determining the intrinsic radiation performance of implanted antennas that focuses on assessing structural and near-field tissue losses is presented. The new method is independent of the tissue phantom employed and can be used for quantitative comparison of designs across different studies. The intrinsic RE of an implant antenna is determined by assessing the power flow within the tissue phantom at a distance of at least λg/2 from the radiating structure. The simulated results are presented for canonical antennas at 403 and 2400 MHz in homogeneous muscle and fat phantoms. These illustrate the dominance of propagating path losses in high-water content tissues such as muscle, whereas near-field dielectric losses may be more important in low-water tissues such as fat due to the extended reactive near-field.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2935113","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/S007954/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805250","Antenna characterization;antenna efficiency;implantable antennas;path loss;radiation efficiency (RE);reactive near-field","Propagation losses;Implants;UHF antennas;Dielectric losses;Conductivity","","10","","48","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the misaligned OAM wavefront demonstrate that the misalignment information can be measured by extracting the features of the OAM mean value distribution and the OAM variance value distribution. It is found in this paper that the extrema of mean OAM distribution and OAM variance distribution correspond to the tilted singularity point and original pivot point, separately. These extrema points can be found by image processing algorithms that recognize round speckles.

In order to reduce the crosstalk between antennas and false detection of vehicles in the parking zone, a bidirectional antenna with low vertical obstacle is required by industry. To that end, a low-profile cavity-excited magnetic dipole-based antenna with vertical polarization is designed. Two vertical sides of the antenna are kept open for the easy access of the reader and powering components. In order to increase the polarization purity along the intended sides, a rectangular truncated ground plane is proved to be beneficial compared to a typical square shaped one. The overall structure of the on-road antenna over the ground plane is around 0.2 × 0.55 × 0.06 λ03 (λ0 is the free space wavelength of the center frequency). The design process and operating principle of the antenna are described in detail along with the effects of different parameters. The antenna is prototyped and measured. The antenna attains high reflection coefficient of -20 dB over 912-930 GHz covering the intended Australian ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) RFID band. The antenna demonstrates bidirectional radiation patterns having a maximum gain of 5 dBi over the required band with -20 dBi cross-polarization level. On-road measurements of the prototype show that the 3 dB beamwidth extends to ±90° elevation angles, which provides high read range while the tags embedded in the vehicle's license plate are in low elevation. The antenna has a rugged structure to sustain more than 10 years in regular road and traffic conditions. By meeting all the requirements, it has been proved to be an effective part of the on-road RFID-enabled intelligent parking system.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2939590","Australian Department of Industry, Innovation and Science via Researchers in Business Grant; Australian Research Council(grant numbers:LP160100916); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8851403","Intelligent parking;on-road RFID;vehicle identification;vehicle monitoring;vertical polarized antenna","Radiofrequency identification;Antenna radiation patterns;Slot antennas;Roads;Dipole antennas;Cavity resonators","","23","","19","IEEE","27 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed BD-SBA differs from the conventional SBA in that the main reflector of the BD-SBA is a phase-modulated metasurface instead of a perfect electric conductor (PEC). The phasemodulated metasurface consists of 15 columns of unit cells which are designed to change the phase of the reflected waves. Therefore, the beam of the BD-SBA can be deflected to a certain angle. First, several BD-SBAs with linear phase-modulated metasurfaces are studied, which indicates that the beam of antennas point at different directions. Second, the BD-SBAs with nonlinear phase-modulated metasurfaces are studied to compare the difference between metasurfaces with linear and nonlinear width variation of patch. The simulated results show that the metasurface with nonlinear variation can obtain better performance than the former. To verify this design method, the BD-SBA with Δθ = 10° was fabricated and measured at X-band. The overall height of the proposed antenna is 0.35 wavelength at 10 GHz. The measured and simulated results are in good agreement; the measured beam-deflection angle, realized gain, and aperture efficiency are 10°, 14.8 dBi, and 68.3% at the center frequency, respectively.

The metasurface superstrate is composed of pairs of non-uniform cut wires with two different lengths. It is compact in size and effective in decoupling two nearby dual-band patch antennas that are strongly coupled in the H-plane with the edge-to-edge spacing of only 0.008 wavelength at low-frequency band (LB). The antenna is fabricated and measured and the results show that the isolation between two dual-band antennas can be improved to more than 25 dB at both 2.5-2.7 GHz and 3.4-3.6 GHz bands, while their reflection coefficients remain to be below -10 dB after the metasurface superstrate is introduced. Moreover, the total efficiency is improved by about 15% in the low band and the envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) between the two antennas is reduced from 0.46 to 0.08 at 2.6 GHz and 0.08 to 0.01 at 3.5 GHz.

The input current and required size of the antenna are estimated using the knowledge of the required field pattern. This solution is based on three steps. First, obtaining the expansion's weighting coefficients that carry both the signature of the current and size of the antenna. In essence, the analysis of the direct modeling needs to be addressed first in order to define these coefficients. Second, extracting the coefficients from the required field pattern using the natural orthogonality property of the spherical harmonic functions. Finally, performing a numerical search for the argument of the spherical Bessel functions to satisfy the ratio between two successive moments. Once the size of the antenna is found, a recursive expression is used to obtain the input current. For the current distributions assumed herein, the odd order coefficients of the MEM are shown to be the only necessary coefficients to construct the radiation far-field. Also, it is found that the estimated model parameters are in excellent agreement with the analytical ones.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2935779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809873","Electromagnetic radiation fields;multipole expansion;spherical harmonics;synthesis;wire antennas","Micromechanical devices;Dipole antennas;Wires;Antenna radiation patterns;Harmonic analysis;Current distribution","","2","","14","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To circumvent this limitation, we present a circuit architecture allowing the excitation of a quasi-optical system (pillbox system) with two feeds per beam to reach much higher beam crossover levels. To this end, a specific eight-beam passive circuit is designed to cover the 76-86 GHz frequency band. It is based on a single-layer substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) coupler followed by equiphase SIW lines. The maximum phase and amplitude imbalance between the sources are only 35 (λg/1g, with λg the wavelength in the SIW lines at the design frequency) and 1.3 dB, respectively, and the isolation is better than -19 dB. The measured beam crossover level of the corresponding antenna is better than -3.2 dB, corresponding to an improvement of 16 dB with respect to single-feed-per-beam pillbox systems. The proposed passive architecture offers beam crossover levels suitable for low-cost electronically controlled multi-beam applications, as for next-generation 5G backhauling systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2934353","Seventh Framework Programme(grant numbers:619563); European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809917","Crossover level;multi-beam antennas;multiple-feed-per-beam;pillbox;substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology","Couplers;Antenna measurements;Apertures;Feeds;Antenna radiation patterns;Radar antennas","","20","","15","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The slots can be arbitrarily rotated within the periodic unit cell. Once the magnetic current density on the slots is obtained by means of MoM, both the transmission coefficient and the far-field radiated by the array of slots are computed. The onset of EOT turns out to be strongly dependent on the orientation of the slots with respect to the direction in which the array is infinite. If the slots are perpendicular to this direction, EOT appears for a single infinite chain of slots. However, tens of parallel chains of slots are required to reproduce the EOT response when the slots are aligned along the parallel chains direction. The obtained radiation patterns show the excitation of grating lobes as the number of slots grow in the direction where the arrays are finite.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2935819","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/L015331/1); Junta de Andalucía(grant numbers:P12-TIC-1435); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad(grant numbers:TEC2017-84724-P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809894","Arrays;moment methods;periodic structures;scattering","Method of moments;Green's function methods;Magnetic domains;Antenna arrays;Current density;Antenna radiation patterns;Optical arrays","","5","","18","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
