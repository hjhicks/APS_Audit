The design concept is simply based on the use of a short period of unit cells and a long transverse slot with a sharp inductive reactance, and it has been theoretically elaborated and effectively validated by both full-wave and circuit-based simulations. A taper design with -25 dB Taylor amplitude distribution is implemented for the proposed LWA to have a low sidelobe radiation. For practical system applications, a hexagonal array consisting of six proposed LWAs is developed to provide an omnidirectional coverage in the azimuth plane while remaining the rapid frequency-driven beam-scanning in the elevation plane. Both the measured and simulated results are in an acceptable agreement with respect to the LWA block and the associated hexagonal array in terms of circuit and radiation performances. The proposed antenna will be a good candidate to be applied for prospective millimeter-wave systems such as autonomous driving and flying.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2970028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979311","Antenna array;beam-scanning rate;dispersion;leaky-wave antenna (LWA);omnidirectional radiation;radiating discontinuity;substrate integrated waveguide (SIW);transverse slot","Antenna arrays;Harmonic analysis;Substrates;Slot antennas;Leaky wave antennas;Loading;Azimuth","","85","","51","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a method of terminal-to-terminal interference suppression, a method of null beamforming for the first eigenvalue of the terminal-to-terminal channel by eigen-beamforming has been studied.

Two crossed dual-capacitance ring resonators (C-DRRs), which can be equivalent to two crossed magnetic dipoles, are then arranged perpendicularly and excited simultaneously with an SMA connector. Only an aluminum ground sheet, metallic screws, and a thin low-cost dielectric PCB board are used, where the dielectric loss is substantially minimized. This SRR-inspired CP antenna, as well as its frequency and polarization reconfigurable derivative by introducing a mechanically tunable inductor or using electrically controllable components, are analyzed and experimentally demonstrated, respectively. The developed antenna achieves an electrically small size of 0.135 λ0 × 0.135 λ0 × 0.045 λ0, and its size is considerably smaller than other reported compact RFID reader antennas.

The presented antenna comprises two orthogonal dipoles with elliptical arms vacated by rotated elliptical slot. The slots and a modified feeding configuration enhance both impedance and axial ratio bandwidth. The antenna has 4.75:1 impedance bandwidth (1.6-7.6 GHz) and 4.1:1 axial ratio bandwidth (1.8-7.1 GHz). To reduce the coupling in quasi-monostatic imaging scenarios, a planar circularly symmetric structure is used that decreases coupling about 10 dB. Due to importance of antenna time-domain behavior in imaging systems, transient response is evaluated in near-fields and also far-fields, which shows a good fidelity factor. The electric field distribution in a region of near-field area is almost uniform in different frequencies that improve imaging. The far-field features like radiation pattern, gain, and axial ratio are also satisfactory. Finally, an oil well monitoring system using the proposed antenna is simulated and based on the results, existed perforations in the well wall are detected. Compared to previous antennas, this antenna has several advantages such as higher impedance and axial ratio bandwidth, planar structure, low front to side ratio which mitigates mutual coupling, and satisfactory transient response.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2975097","Iran National Science Foundation (INSF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9011752","Antenna transient response;circularly polarized (CP);crossed dipole antenna;near-field imaging;oil well monitoring;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Bandwidth;Dipole antennas;Impedance;Imaging;Radar imaging;Oils","","28","","53","IEEE","25 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this concept, a conventional parabolic surface is first created for ordinary field radiation by a focal feed in the low-frequency band. Afterward, a feed of high-frequency band is offset from the focal point to result in defocused radiation due to the phase distortion of reflection from the parabolic reflector. Metallic PAEs are subsequently implemented on the reflector to configure their phases of reflections for distortion compensation, and thus to refocus the radiation power along a desired direction.

The SAPAA consists of an S-band array with a triangular placement that has 11 elements and a grid array with 8 × 16 X-band elements. To avoid grating lobes in wide beam scanning coverage, a metamaterial-based stacked mushroom structure is proposed to reduce the array spacing of the two bands, where an X-band patch antenna is stacked on a traditional mushroom structure. A 4 × 4 subarray of the stacked mushroom structure operates as a single antenna element in S-band. Consequently, each S-band element corresponds to a 4 × 4 subarray of the X-band element. Because a triangular arrangement in the S-band array and a square arrangement in the X-band array are employed, the array spacing of the two bands is 0.54λL0 and 0.51λH0, respectively, which is suitable for wide beam scanning coverage. Moreover, the shorting pin of the mushroom structure is also the feeding pin of the X-band patch. This structure reuse technology reduces the whole profile to less than 0.04λ0.

The performance bound is calculated for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antennas with a radiation efficiency requirement. A convex optimization problem is formulated in the current density of the antenna, this problem is solved by constructing its dual problem. The solution to this problem is based on a set of modes known as the radiation modes. This article shows how to perform modal analysis using these modes to evaluate design strategies for maximal spectral efficiency. This is illustrated both for electrically small and large structures.

The antenna consists of one driven patch and two parasitic patches. The parasitic patches are placed parallel to the two adjacent edges of a driven patch. By introducing four sets of shorting pins near the outer edges of the patches, surface currents on the patches flow through the pins to the edges of the ground plane periodically, making those edges radiate as electrical dipole elements. Huygens'-like radiation with extended HPBW and low back-lobe level is formed by the interaction of dipole and patch-like radiation sources.

It is well known that every chip requires a package to protect it from the environment; however, this package does not provide any functionality, despite adding to the cost and required space. In this article, we propose a functional package that has been designed to enhance the gain of the AoC. A 71 GHz coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed on-chip monopole antenna, driven by a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and frequency doubler, was realized in the standard 0.18 μm CMOS technology. As a first step to enhance its gain, the AoC was designed on top of an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) surface. Further gain enhancement was achieved by transforming the chip package into a combination of a superstrate layer and a Fresnel lens, qualifying this as a system-on-package (SoP). The package has been realized through additive manufacturing to maintain the low-cost aspect. Overall, the measured gain of the packaged AoC is 6.8 dBi, which has been enhanced by ~20 dBs compared to the unpackaged antenna without an AMC layer.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2975276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014552","Antenna-on-chip (AoC);artificial magnetic conductor (AMC);Fresnel lens;gain enhancement;superstrate;system-on-package (SoP)","Antennas;Silicon;Substrates;Lenses;Surface waves;System-on-chip;Metals","","26","","29","IEEE","26 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The direction of the radiation beam can be adjusted independently in the H- or E-plane by laterally offsetting the feed waveguide or bending the waveguide linking with the metallic flare that operates as a radiating structure. By this means, five Cassegrain subarrays with multiple waveguide inputs and different bending angles are stacked to build a high-gain wideband 2-D multibeam antenna array in the Ka-band, whose 3 dB beams cover angular ranges of ±60° in the E-plane and ±18° in the H-plane.

Several important design features are proposed and implemented. The dipoles act as parasitic elements for the monopole structure, which broadens the monopole bandwidth and reduces the mutual coupling.

In the new encoding mechanism, each individual represents a certain element position rather than an entire array layout used in traditional stochastic optimization algorithms. Such an encoding mechanism has the following advantages: 1) in each individual updating, the array pattern can be efficiently evaluated by only considering the radiation contribution variation from one element movement, which can greatly reduce the computational time; 2) it naturally facilitates the generated new array layout in population updating to meet the minimum element spacing constraint, and 3) each individual is searched always in 2-D space as the array size increases. These advantages enable it to be very suitable for synthesizing large arrays. Besides, DE serves as a search engine, and Cauchy mutation with chaotic mapping is proposed to enhance the local search while preserving the diversity of the population. A set of experiments for synthesizing different types of unequally spaced planar arrays in both narrow-and broadband applications are conducted. Synthesis results show that the proposed method achieves much lower sidelobe level than some state-of-the-art stochastic optimization methods for all the test cases. Importantly, the proposed method is much more efficient than conventional stochastic optimization algorithm especially for the case of synthesizing large unequally spaced planar array layouts.

One-step leapfrog alternating direction implicit (ADI) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method overcomes the Courant stability condition in FG region; meanwhile, conventional FDTD ensures the efficiency of simulation in CG region.

More specifically, these “nodes” with the same number as those of radiated patterns share a set of common excitation magnitudes, which results in a special magnitude-consensus computation problem in the imitated sensor network. Then, via locally computing the excitation in each “node” and exchanging current computation results with neighboring “nodes,” all “nodes” obtain the magnitude-consensus excitations after the “network” is stable.

The procedure is verified by 8 × 8 and 16 × 16 arrays of magnetoelectric dipoles (ME dipole) fed by microstrip ridge gap waveguide (MRGW) through a narrow slot. This procedure is based on using the frequency-dependent effective input impedance at the port of each element, which includes the effect of the mutual coupling between the antenna elements, which is used to design the corporate feeding network. In addition, the far-field characteristics of the array parameters such as directivity, gain, and the radiation patterns are predicted using the pattern multiplication method including the mutual coupling. The results are verified with the full-wave numerical solution. The procedure requires limited resources and speed up the design cycle. In the presented examples, the array elements are directly excited by the MRGW, which provides more flexibility to design complicated feeding networks and allow for distances between the elements less than a wavelength. Therefore, grating lobes are avoided. To accommodate such constraints, special designs of the power dividers are performed to provide the symmetric location of MRGW lines to avoid coupling between the feeding network lines. Furthermore, a transition from waveguide WR-15 to the MRGW is proposed to differential feed of the array antenna. The 16 × 16 array of ME dipoles has been fabricated.

More precisely, the transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode and the first transverse electric (TE1) mode of the feeding waveguides are used to generate a circularly polarized field. The array is analyzed using a spectral mode-matching method. First, the active reflection coefficient of the infinite array is derived in closed form.

Numerical results obtained with this method are in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations, carried out with a commercial software. The performance of this class of CTS antennas has been investigated using the developed model. It is theoretically demonstrated that the proposed array can be designed to attain an axial ratio (AR) lower than 3 dB over a 52.9% relative bandwidth at broadside.

However, the output signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) performance is usually quite away from the optimum. Besides, as the number of antenna elements increases, the hardware cost and power consumption are still too high for many applications. In this article, based on the phase-only CB, we propose different ways for thinning this kind of antenna arrays, which can be efficiently solved via common convex-optimization solvers. Specifically, the first-derived phase-only thinned array can largely increase the output SINR with fewer active antenna elements than the CB. The second one can keep the output SINR performance as that of the CB with a significantly smaller number of active antenna elements than that required by the CB. The third criterion is to add an additional constraint on the number of active antenna elements while maximizing the output SINR, which may benefit the hardware planning. Simulation results confirm the feasibilities of these methods, and the above-stated tasks are all fulfilled. Therefore, the proposed phase-only thinned arrays have the flexibility to provide various levels of array performance with reduced hardware resources.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2977732","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 108-2221-E-260-003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028082","Conventional beamformer (CB);convex optimization;minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer;phase-only beamformer;semidefinite relaxation (SDR);thinned antenna array","Interference;Phased arrays;Signal to noise ratio;Hardware;Power demand","","19","","33","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The optimal design process is characterized by a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP). The complicated QCQP problem is solved by introducing a weighted diagonal matrix. The radiated power from the transmitting antenna array can be distributed among the multiple targets according to predetermined pattern by adjusting the weighted diagonal matrix. Once the positions of the targets and the predetermined field focusing pattern are all set, the test receiving antennas may be introduced to replace the targets, and the power transmission efficiency between the transmitting antenna array and the test receiving antennas is then maximized, which guarantees the maximum possible power delivery to each target in a focused manner. A unique optimal solution for the distribution of excitations can be found explicitly by analytically solving the QCQP. Several systems are designed for focusing the power to multiple targets in closed and open regions to demonstrate the focusing performance of the transmitting array excited with the optimized distributions of excitations obtained from QCQP.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2972311","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971231); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8998550","Antenna array;focused antenna;power transmission efficiency (PTE);quadratically constrained quadratic programing (QCQP)","Antenna arrays;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Power transmission;Focusing;Scattering","","36","","45","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such analysis leads to the definition of an area in the 2-D-angular field-of-view of the radar, denoted as ambiguity-free region, characterized by a low probability to obtain ambiguities in direction of arrival estimation. Simulations of a basic 2-D-MIMO array are used to explain the proposed method, which is then employed as the main criterion for the optimization of a 2-D-MIMO sparse array composed of four transmitters and eight receivers. The optimization is performed through a genetic algorithm. The resulted element positions guarantee an ambiguity-free region span in the azimuth and elevation angles greater than 120° and angular resolutions of 8° and 5.9° on the azimuth and elevation angles, respectively. The optimized positions are then used to realize a 2-D-MIMO sparse array that is integrated in a radar system operating at a center frequency of 76.5 GHz.

The active element pattern (AEP) is used for each antenna element, and then the rotation of an element is approximately described by mathematically rotating its AEP under the assumption that the mutual coupling variation does not change the AEP considerably. Optimal element rotations and phases for an array can be found by solving a vectorial shaped pattern synthesis problem such that the obtained array pattern has the desired co-polarization mainlobe shape while maintaining constrained sidelobe and cross-polarization levels. However, due to the variation of mutual coupling, this synthesized pattern may deviate from the real array pattern. To reduce the pattern discrepancy, successive refined joint element rotation/phase optimizations are adopted. As the number of refining steps increases, the allowable element rotation range is set to be smaller and smaller so that the synthesized array pattern can get closer and closer to the real one. Such a shaped power pattern synthesis technique does not need nonuniform amplitude weighting, thus saving many unequal power dividers. Three examples for synthesizing rotated linear and planar arrays with different antenna structures and different pattern shape requirements are provided to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2975277","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61871338); University of Technology Sydney; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014518","Active element pattern (AEP);cross-polarization level (XPL);joint rotation/phase optimization;rotated antenna array;shaped power pattern synthesis","Optimization;Mutual coupling;Phased arrays;Linear antenna arrays;Planar arrays;Shape","","36","","38","IEEE","26 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reactive components, such as capacitors and inductors embedded in the resonant unit cell, are fabricated using a multistep thin-film process based on benzocyclobutene (BCB) resin. The capacitors are built as planar metal-insulator-metal structures using an ultra-thin dielectric layer of BCB, while the multiturn inductors are fabricated as planar spiral structures with two metal layers and BCB as an interlevel dielectric for crossover. The advantages of the proposed approach are the capability to obtain large values of capacitances and inductances within small areas with low parasitics as well as the benefits in cost reduction and easy fabrication by using a planar microfabrication process. A component value variation analysis is performed to study the effect of fabrication tolerances in the reflection and transmission coefficients of the FSS when non-identical small cells are obtained.

The computational domain is discretized by tetrahedrons and the resultant meshes are categorized into two regions solved by Maxwell’s equations and Helmholtz vector wave equation, respectively. The hierarchical vector basis functions are used to expand the unknowns in the HDGTD method, and a universal matrix technique is proposed to decompose the geometry-dependent matrices in each tetrahedron into the summation of universal matrices defined in barycentric coordinates, thus giving rise to a great decrease of the memory usage. A local time stepping (LTS) method based on a simple interpolation is introduced in the proposed HDGTD method to achieve highly efficient solution of multiscale problems.

When coupled with FEM in the framework of domain decomposition, the infinite computational domain is truncated by a closed rotationally symmetric surface enclosing the 3-D scatterer, and BEM-BoR is then applied on this surface as a radiation boundary condition (RBC). The finite-domain interior to this surface is further decomposed into several subdomains, which are connected by the second-order transmission conditions (SOTCs) imposed on nonconformal meshes. We refer to the resultant solver as a hybrid FEM-DDM and BEM-BoR (FEM-BEM-BoR). Since BEM-BoR can be divided into several 2-D problems instead of the original 3-D one, the proposed FEM-BEM-BoR is more efficient than the original FEM-BEM.

In the forward model, the stabilized biconjugate gradient fast Fourier transform (BCGS-FFT) method is used to solve the volume electric field integral equation (EFIE). In the inversion model, VBIM is employed to minimize the cost function. In order to improve the inversion results, we propose a novel structural consistency constraint (SCC) applied to VBIM. The SCC is based on the Monte Carlo method and reduces the computational domain in the Born iteration. The major new contribution of this work is to combine the deterministic inversion algorithm VBIM with the stochastic Monte Carlo method to reconstruct all the diagonal anisotropic parameters of the scatterers.

Path loss (PL) exponent values varied between 2.33 and 1.26. The time dispersion parameters and channel capacities are computed for both CP and 90R scenarios. Moreover, channel correlation matrices and the Rician K-factor have been determined and discussed in terms of their effect on capacity and root mean square (rms) delay spread. Overall, the circularly polarized setup exhibits the best performance in terms of PL, rms delay spread, and channel capacity. The nonline-of-sight (NLOS) situation caused a significant drop in channel capacity due to the significant increase in PL, and an increase in the rms delay spread due to the multipath richness. The MIMO-NLOS scenario exhibits the highest throughput gain of 1.752 (at an SNR of 20 dB), due to its low branch correlation.

To accurately simulate the reflection and refraction effects of EW propagation near the sea surface, an improved fractal sea surface model is used to construct the geometric rough sea surface. The results of the Pade(2,2) approximation PE model are compared with those of the Miller-Brown model, and good agreement is observed. Numerous experiments prove that the 2WPE model is more accurate than the one-way parabolic equation model for predicting large-scale radio wave propagation in marine environments. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the backward-scattered EWs and the wind speed. The polynomial fitting method is adopted to process a large amount of sampled data for backward-scattered EWs with different wind speeds and frequencies. Through accurate judgment of the points of the polynomial fitting curve in a certain frequency range, the wind speed over the sea surface can be precisely determined.

The wave is nonphysical in the sense that a simple source such as a dipole will not excite a field that resembles the Zenneck wave at large distances from the source. However, by using a tapered line source, a field that resembles the Zenneck wave can be produced along the surface of the earth or ocean out to some distance.

Recently, there has been increasing research into antennas working at frequencies from 20 to 70 GHz. General-purpose anechoic chambers are usually between 5 and 10 m in size, which leads to free-space distances longer than required at millimeter-wave frequencies and corresponding larger cables losses. Designing anechoic chambers tailored to such a frequency range would lead to minimum losses and improve measurement performance. If uncertainty is considered all the way from the design stage to operation, it will be easier to obtain highly accurate measurement outcomes. This article focuses on the issues related to uncertainty in a tailor-made millimeter-wave anechoic chamber at every step before achieving a fully functional measurement system. This includes setting the requirements for the chamber, calculating its dimensions, designing the structure, and selecting the building materials, in order finally to characterize its performance by measuring the insulation from external signals and the ripple in the quiet zone.

Radiometric sounding measurements used for providing data for weather prediction are strongly affected by the main beam, ohmic, and spillover efficiencies of the optics, as well as by inhomogeneities in the scene and background radiation fields. The interpretation of radiometric data is affected by the accuracy with which these antenna efficiencies can be determined, particularly for radiometers that do not permit full main beam external calibration. To this end, an HE11 mode full wave Fourier-Bessel electromagnetic field analysis was developed for determination of an optimal feed horn and reflector geometry such that the main beam and spillover efficiencies of the system are maximized, and these and the antenna phase center location that maximizes phase efficiency are precisely known. The efficacy of employing a sub-millimeter wave 3-D-printed corrugated conical horn operable between 110 and 127 GHz as the feed for an offset paraboloidal reflector due to its very low cost and rapid manufacturability is also addressed. Horn measurements indicate a reflection coefficient below -15 dB and far-field radiation patterns that compare closely to simulation. Although there is some asymmetry in the horn pattern, the average main beam efficiency is 89% for a main reflector subtending a 16° half-angle. Initial performance obtained from airborne measurements over Antarctica on the NASA DC-8 during Operation IceBridge in Oct-Nov 2016 suggests a well-focused scanning antenna subsystem. After final payload assembly, the antenna's 3 dB beamwidth extracted from a bridge-scan field experiment was broader by ~ 0.1° compared with the idealized simulated pattern.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2970099","NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship for her Ph.D; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979293","3-D-printed corrugated horn;CubeSat radiometer;Fourier analysis;microwave radiometry;offset reflector;prelaunch calibration;quasi-optics","Microwave radiometry;Antenna feeds;Temperature measurement;CubeSat","","2","","48","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The numerical results reveal that the external dc magnetic field applied in breakdown volume can significantly enhance the breakdown threshold to suppress the HPM breakdown, which is beneficial for the propagation of HPM pulse in air-filled waveguide. Our research provides theoretical guidance for suppressing the impact of HPM breakdown for HPM devices protection.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2969894","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871228,61931021,61890541); National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environment Effects(grant numbers:JCKYS2019 DC4,614220503030317); National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Space Microwave(grant numbers:2018SSFNKLSMT-06); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:30918011202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979297","External dc magnetic field;high-power microwave (HPM) breakdown;Maxwell???s equations;plasma fluid equations;spectral-element time-domain (SETD) method","Electric breakdown;Mathematical model;Magnetic fields;Plasmas;Fluids;Microwave communication","","28","","31","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We demonstrate that, while the impact of the phantom may be significant on antenna efficiency, and, it has some influence on the uncertainty in the measurement, its impact on overall uncertainty may be insignificant. This is demonstrated using the two-antenna method in the presence of a phantom close to the antenna under test. We illustrate the method by summarizing the antenna efficiencies with their uncertainties and the impact of the phantom for important communication bands.

Meanwhile, the antenna should also have high receiving efficiency in order to effectively convert the collected energy into radio frequency current. To meet this requirement, a novel broadband dual circularly polarized (CP) dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) with high receiving efficiency is proposed. The characteristic mode analysis (CMA) is applied to analyze the proposed DRA to reveal the intrinsic behavior of the DR, so that proper mode excitations can be guided. It is found that broadband CP radiation is achieved by exciting two pairs of orthogonal degeneration modes. By choosing a broadband feeding structure, a broadband DRA can be obtained. When different ports are excited, left-hand CP (LHCP) or right-hand CP (RHCP) field can be generated. Measurements show that the antenna has a 3 dB axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth of 43.5%. The impedance bandwidth is wide enough to cover the whole AR bandwidth. The receiving efficiency of the proposed antenna is about 85% within most of the operating frequency range.

Indeed, other than a rather low permittivity of commercial 3-D-printable materials, when flexibility is required, also significant loss tangent values must be accounted. To address this problem, a method to realize conformable flexible low-loss substrates with increased and customizable permittivity is proposed in this communication. It is based on the synthesis of ceramic-doped silicone structures shaped through 3-D-printed molds by using alumina and barium titanate as ceramic filler. Different substrates were firstly realized and characterized in terms of permittivity and loss tangent at different doping percentages. Then, a first validation on 2.4 GHz conformal patch antennas exploiting both third dimension and increased permittivity is presented. Finally, a wearable and compact bracelet-shaped UHF RFID planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA)-inspired flexible antenna is designed, tested when applied on the human body, and compared with a previously realized version 3-D-printed in polylactic acid.

The 45° linear polarization (LP) is obtained by feeding all patches with the same phase, i.e., setting all varactor capacitance the same value. The circular polarization (CP) is obtained by slightly detuning the varactor capacitance such that the phase difference between the horizontal and vertical radiating elements is 90°.

The antenna is composed of a dual-band lens and a pair of linear phase gradient (PG) TAs. The presented anisotropic lens is polarization independent, operating at two frequency bands. The PG TA is implemented by using double square loop units with different PGs at two frequencies. Two rotatable PG TAs are located above and parallel to the dual-band lens, and beam scanning in the upper hemisphere is achieved by rotating the two PG TAs synchronously around the axis orthogonal to the planes of the PG TAs. The procedure is demonstrated for dual-band beam-scanning implementation operating in linear polarization at  $X$ - and  $Ku$ -band. The full-wave simulation results demonstrate that the designed antenna enables beam steering in both azimuth and elevation planes at 8 and 14 GHz, with a peak gain of 16.7 and 19.8 dB in the broadside direction, respectively.

The approach entails the moment method using parallel-plate waveguide cavity Green's functions and a numerical spectral-domain Green's function for planar stratified media accompanied by the Floquet theorem. Computed results obtained from codes written based on this formulation are validated with those simulated by a commercial full-wave software solver as well as results from the literature. Validation is performed in terms of reflection and transmission spectra as well as modal dispersion. The new parameters arising from the special complex geometry herein studied provide the means to enhance the performances of various applications such as beam deflectors, mode converters, and grating couplers, as well as the resolution of diffraction gratings in the context of spectroscopy.

The designed structure comprises a switchable layer, an air spacer, and a metal ground. The switchable layer contains active resonant elements, whose switching properties are realized by controlling p-i-n diodes. Bias networks for the p-i-n diodes are integrated into the structures and no dedicated bias lines are required. Thus, the negative effect of extra bias lines can be alleviated. In order to achieve switchable and polarization-insensitive properties simultaneously, a super-element configuration is developed by combining four similar unitary elements. One unique feature of the designed device lies in its real-time and multifunctional capability to switch among multiple working states. In addition, the switchable bandwidth of the proposed structure covers a much wider frequency band compared with previous switchable absorber/reflector designs. Distributions of electric field and surface current as well as an equivalent circuit model are presented to gain the necessary physical insight into the working mechanism of the switchable structure.
