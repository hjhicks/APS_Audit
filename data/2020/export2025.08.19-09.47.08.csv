The novelty of the design is its combination of glide symmetry and a single-layer Goubau line. This combination leads to performance enhancement in both scanning rate and scanning angle range. Utilizing a corrugated Goubau line in a glide-symmetry fashion closes its stopband at the cutoff frequency while slowing down its group velocity. As the dispersion around the closed stopband is shifted to the fast-wave region by periodic profile modulation, the space harmonics exhibit high-scanning-rate radiation. In conjunction with this, the single-layer nature of the Goubau line allows the beam to scan from nearly endfire to backfire directions, leading to a wide scanning angle range. Numerical examples and experimental validation are provided to validate the proposed design. These show that the proposed antenna exhibits dual-band operation, where one band scans 152° within 2.2 GHz (corresponding to scanning rate of 69°/GHz) with 67% efficiency, while the second band scans 145° within 0.7 GHz (corresponding to scanning rate of 207°/GHz) with 26% efficiency. A tradeoff between scanning rate and efficiency always exists in high-scanning-rate leaky-wave antennas. One is able to freely choose the preferred scanning rate in this single antenna.

Due to the presence of the insulating layer, both the boundary conditions and the kernel function of the antenna are more complicated. The determination of the wave number kL requires extra analytical techniques, as the pole equation satisfied by kL will include both the ordinary and extraordinary waves. Computations show that for insulating layers of small thickness, the amplitude coefficient increases with the plasma density. However, if the insulation is sufficiently thick, then the coefficient will only be slightly affected by the plasma parameters. It is, thus, inferred that an insulating layer tends to make the antenna characteristics less dependent on the ambient plasma and, thus, more predictable. In addition, it is found that the input impedance of the antenna significantly increases with the insulation thickness. Calculations of driving-point admittances are presented for two case studies and compared with existing analytical work and the simulation results. Finally, this article may provide some heuristic support for designing VLF space-borne insulated linear antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2951531","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571389,61271086); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8895746","Anisotropic plasma;input impedance;insulated linear antenna;very low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic (EM) wave","Antennas;Plasmas;Impedance;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Current distribution;Ionosphere","","12","","30","IEEE","11 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed metallic resonator antenna achieves low loss and hence high radiation efficiency because majority of fields of SSPP modes concentrates in air rather than in dielectric compared with conventional dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs).

By loading the slot and the metal strip, the radiation pattern of TM21 mode is converted from conical to broadside, and the ground walls further concentrate the radiation pattern. The ground walls also enhance the antenna gain, with the increments of 1 dB at 3.5 GHz, 3.4 dB at 4.65 GHz, 4.1 dB at 5.5 GHz, and 1.4 dB at 6.3 GHz. Finally, the antenna is fabricated and measured. The measured results show that the antenna covers five impedance bandwidths (IMBWs) of 1.85-1.91 GHz (3.2%), 3.13-3.66 GHz (15.6%), 4.62-4.98 GHz (7.5%), 5.10-5.82 GHz (13.2%), and 6.10-6.57 GHz (7.4%) for |S11| <; -10 dB.

A multiple iterative method is adopted, which overcomes the limitation of large phase deviations at the interface of traditional lens antennas, thus increases the directivity as a result. Moreover, the glide-symmetric configurations of inner metallic pins within the gap waveguide are employed to construct the artificial dielectric lens, with the advantage of the ultralow dispersion, which is especially helpful to broaden the working bandwidth and improve the lens performance. The antenna is fed by a stepped double-ridged gap waveguide which can easily excite the antenna working in a wideband. To reduce the undesired reflections at the antenna aperture, the antenna is ended with a tapered structure as an impedance transition. A prototype of the horn lens antenna is manufactured and measured, showing a broad operation bandwidth from 12 to 18.5 GHz with S11 less than −10 dB. The antenna can be further extended to the millimeter band due to the low losses of the gap waveguide at high frequencies and the iterative method can also be applied to other types of lens antenna designs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2955919","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFA0701904,2017YFA0700201,2017YFA0700202,2017YFA0700203); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631007,61571117,61138001,61371035,61722106,61731010,11227904); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:111-2-05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935539","Gap waveguide;glide symmetry;horn lens antennas","Lenses;Gap waveguide;Indexes;Refractive index;Surface waves;Apertures","","31","","38","IEEE","17 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the effect of losses in the silicon substrate and improve the antenna's radiation efficiency, the wafer thickness is often drastically reduced. However, the close proximity of the antenna and ground plane can cause an impedance mismatch. Metal tiles, which are embedded in silicon dioxide layers, are designed as an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) to increase the radiation efficiency and tune the antenna impedance. A double-layer AMC is applied instead of a single-layer AMC to reduce the silicon dielectric loss. Additionally, the double-layer AMC has more capacitance to tune the impedance when integrating with a monopole on-chip antenna. The resulting -10 dB impedance bandwidth is increased to 5.8 GHz around the 60 GHz band, the simulated realized gain increases by 3.3 dB, and the simulated antenna radiation efficiency is increased from 11% to 21%.

The SNA has very similar capabilities as the Vivaldi in all metrics (match, gain, port isolation, and bandwidth), except that the SNA demonstrates lower cross-polarization (cross-pol) across all scan angles and frequencies. Both arrays are optimally sampled and have excellent matching from 2.6 to 21.2 GHz with zero scan blindness out to wide angles. For this demonstration, uniform slices are introduced in the flares to satisfy a single design criterion of -10 dB cross-pol (relative to copolarized fields) for a 45° scan cone at all frequencies, culminating in a peak SNA cross-pol improvement of 35 dB (relative to the reference Vivaldi array). Infinite array predictions are followed up by measurements on a 256-port prototype aperture.

The basic idea of the proposed method is to convert a variable definition domain problem into a fixed definition domain problem through coordinate transformation. Based on this, the optimization is well integrated with the method of moments (MoM), and it is convenient to calculate the radiation pattern properties and their sensitivities with respect to the design variables. Thus, the design optimization problem can be efficiently solved by use of any gradient-based algorithm. Additionally, benefiting from the combination of the mapping transformation and the full-wave MoM simulation, the mutual coupling between array elements is rigorously taken into account and the complex meshing of the surrounding radiation region is avoided. Furthermore, the change in the array performance is derived only associating with the transformation variables, thus remeshing for iteratively changed arrangements is avoided and the computing cost is saved.

Applications include the wireless charging of mobile phones and other handheld devices. The reported RDA defines an active high-power transmitter module that retrodirects a received beacon tone back to a mobile unit by circularly polarized (CP) free-space radiation. In addition, this RDA architecture uses a network of four subarrays, defined by a total of 16 radiating patch elements, in an effort to boost the transmit gain while also reducing the supporting RF hardware requirements when compared to a more conventional RDA. Measurements and simulations in the reactive near-field of the system are in agreement in terms of the tracking capabilities of the high-power CP-RDA. Power levels in excess of 27 dBm were measured at 2.4 GHz at a receiver module, and when this RF power was rectified, more than 350 mW at dc was observed. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first demonstration of a WPT system using a mixer-based analog RDA. Previous low-power demonstrations were more complex computer-controlled systems that did not offer any real-time tracking ability.

The analysis covers both the classical Littrow configuration, when the direction of the relevant diffracted order coincides with that of the incident wave (Bragg blazing), and when these directions are different (off-Bragg blazing). Once the scattering problem of the grating structure is posed as a discontinuity problem inside an equivalent generalized waveguide (corresponding to the unit cell of the original structure) and studied in terms of its equivalent circuit network, the possibility of transferring all the power of the incident plane wave into one single-diffraction order is seen as a simple impedance matching problem.

This simplifying and fruitful standpoint makes it possible to set up a systematic design procedure to find the specifications of the planar grating for either Bragg or non-Bragg blazing operation.

Second, the CAS is discretized into a set of indexed discrete sources, and the CAS integral is represented by a matrix whose column indexes correspond to the discrete source indexes. Third, skeleton columns of the matrix are identified by the skeletonization scheme, and an array is constructed using the discrete sources whose indexes are the same as the skeleton column indexes. In order to match the CAS radiation pattern, values of the discrete sources are computed using a transformation matrix obtained during the skeletonization process.

In developing a compact staggered dipole array, the most challenging issue is how to simultaneously reduce the four mutual couplings taking place between adjacent co-polarized antenna elements with diversified phase laggings. A large difference in the phase of different mutual couplings makes simultaneous reduction of all the mutual couplings by applying the recently developed array-antenna decoupling surface (ADS) technique difficult. In this article, a phase compensation method by using a staple-shaped probe for alleviating the largest phase offset is proposed conceptually and verified experimentally. With the proposed phase compensation method, the ADS technique can be effectively applied to a compact staggered dipole array with a wideband simultaneous decoupling. The design guideline for the phase compensation probe is presented by EM simulation and a parametric study. Two practical design examples of dual polarized staggered dipole arrays are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed phase compensation method in conjunction with ADS, showing a promising potential for wideband simultaneous decoupling of a large-scale dual polarized staggered dipole array-antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2955166","Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee(grant numbers:14205217); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917811","Array-antenna decoupling surface (ADS);decoupling;large-scale array antenna;massive multiple input and multiple output (M-MIMO);mutual coupling;staggered array","Mutual coupling;Dipole antennas;Phased arrays;Probes;Receiving antennas;Array signal processing","","65","","26","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the localization performance is degraded because of mutual coupling, unknown time delays, and imprecisely known antenna positions, especially if large arrays with spatially distributed antennas are used. Furthermore, these errors are altered until the array is steadily installed at its destination, which occurs because of position misalignment and cable phase instability. Hence, an in-situ array calibration is necessary to perform faultless phase measurements. For this purpose, this article proposes a novel calibration procedure for antenna arrays, correcting both the mutual coupling and positioning errors using an incoherently transmitting beacon. Because the in-situ calibration will be affected by multipath, measurements at random reference positions within the array's near field are used for calibration. In addition, the algorithm copes with randomly varying path losses because of unknown antenna polarizations and patterns. Calibration measurements are performed, providing physically reasonable results without using an anechoic environment. Furthermore, the calibration results are validated via indoor localization using three antenna arrays that were calibrated with the proposed algorithm.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2955147","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:DFG VO 1453/27-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917918","Antenna array;calibration;indoor navigation;localization;mutual coupling;radar","Antenna arrays;Antenna measurements;Calibration;Transponders;Radar antennas;Radar;Receiving antennas","","31","","40","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reflected EM wave contains significant components at multiple sideband frequencies along with the original incident frequency. The time-modulated complex-valued reflection coefficient can be appropriately designed to highly suppress the original incident frequency component and significantly boost the sidebands. Such a time-modulated surface can help in evading Doppler radar where the object velocity is detected from the Doppler shifted frequency of received signal. The presence of multiple frequency sidebands and suppression of the original frequency component can make Doppler radar imaging very difficult or even impossible when the modulation frequencies are dynamically managed. Here, the reflected EM wave from an FSS is modulated by applying a time-varying periodic biasing voltage across varactor diodes in the FSS. Variation in the bias voltage changes the reflection coefficient of the FSS and thereby modulates the reflected EM wave. A prototype of the designed modulator surface is fabricated to verify the modulation performance experimentally. Here, two modulation schemes, sinusoidal and saw-tooth biasing, have been demonstrated to show symmetrical and asymmetrical power distributions in the sidebands.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2951494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8895838","Harmonic generation;modulation;time-modulated frequency-selective surface (FSS);tunable FSS;velocity illusion","Frequency modulation;Surface waves;Varactors;Frequency selective surfaces;Capacitance;Time-frequency analysis","","41","","30","IEEE","11 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The metasurface antenna consists of a coax-fed planar waveguide/cavity embedded with subwavelength-sized metamaterial radiators that convert energy from the guided mode into a radiated wave. Designing a metasurface requires tailoring the geometry of the individual metamaterial elements and arranging them over the aperture to achieve a desired radiation pattern-a typically cumbersome and time-consuming task when performed with full-wave solvers. In recent work, a coupled-dipole approach has been applied to modeling metasurfaces that significantly accelerates the design process by avoiding reliance on full-wave simulations or experimental trials. In this article, we extend the coupled-dipole model of a metasurface by including the analytic model of a coaxial port. Using the reaction and equivalent circuit model of a coaxial-to-waveguide transition, we also propose an efficient method to compute the input impedance of a metasurface, enabling the calculation of gain and efficiency.

When the digital bit of a metasurface is higher, its controlling capability will be stronger. However, it is extremely difficult to realize 3-bit and higher digital coding metasurfaces since an  $n$ -bit digital element will require many active devices (e.g., p-i-n diodes) to achieve  $2^{n}$  digital states. Here, we propose to realize arbitrary multi-bit programmable phases using 2-bit time-domain digital coding metasurface at the central frequency or harmonic frequencies. We introduce the method of vector synthesis to design the phase coverages, from which 4-bit and arbitrarily higher-bit coding phases are synthesized by a physical coding metasurface with only 2-bit phases, simply by manipulating the time-coding sequences. A prototype controlled by a field-programmable gate array is used to validate this methodology. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis, which demonstrate good performance of the proposed method in dynamically realizing arbitrary multi-bit programmable phases. This time-varying coding strategy provides a new way to design higher bit programmable metasurface and simplify the structural design and control system, which will find many potential applications such as high-resolution imaging and high-capacity wireless communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2955219","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFA0700201,2017YFA0700202,2017YFA0700203); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631007,61571117,61501112,61501117,61522106,61731010,61735010,61722106,61701107,61701108); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:111-2-05); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61761136007); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX18_0097); Southeast University(grant numbers:YBPY1858); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917926","Digital coding metasurface;multi-bit phases;programmable;quantization error;time-varying","Encoding;Time-domain analysis;Time-frequency analysis;Harmonic analysis;Reflection coefficient;Antennas","","118","","59","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resultant explicit time marching is guaranteed to be stable because such subgridding operators have only nonnegative real eigenvalues. Furthermore, the use of a time step local to the base grid and the subgrid is permitted without sacrificing stability and accuracy. Moreover, the algorithm takes the subgrid information into account to accurately analyze inhomogeneous problems. In addition, we provide an interpretation of the proposed subgridding operators and show how to implement them in the original difference equation-based FDTD framework.

Due to their structural complexity, these materials are prone to errors while in the manufacturing process, thus non-destructive inspecting becomes a crucial step in the processing chain and further maintenance of said material. However, a tomographic characterization of these components is often only possible to a limited extent-a capability which is essential to exploit the full potential of this technology. Measurement systems based on millimeter waves (mmWs) have the potential to achieve exactly that, by providing valuable information on the internal structure of such components. Yet, these non-destructive and non-contact methods have not found wide usage in practical applications. One reason for this is that the effects composite materials have on the propagation behavior of mmW signals have not been a major subject of study in the past. Therefore, a model for predicting the propagation properties of mmW signals in composite materials is presented here. Based on coupled wave analysis, the propagation of arbitrary electromagnetic signals in composite materials can be simulated. These results can be directly incorporated into the design of respective measurement systems. The introduced model is verified through a comparison of simulation and measurement results, obtained via a focused frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, operating in the $H$ -band (220-325 GHz), directed at glass fiber reinforced plastic samples.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2955213","Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie(grant numbers:0324055A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917810","Composite materials;coupled mode analysis;electromagnetic modeling;millimeter wave (mmW) propagation;millimeter wave radar","Permittivity;Glass;Composite materials;Antennas;Millimeter wave propagation;Plastics;Resins","","12","","54","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The statistical nature of this problem, in particular, the random dielectric profile, introduces randomness in the phase of the electromagnetic field such that the field loses its phase coherency after traveling in the layered medium for a few correlation lengths of the permittivity. In this situation, there is a coherency length within which a coherent solution of Maxwell's equation is required. For the distances beyond this coherency length, a combined coherent-incoherent cascading approach can be applied to reduce the computational complexity of the problem. The coherent response of each “block” within the medium (with a length approximately the coherency length) can be cascaded incoherently ignoring the phase response without losing accuracy. Cascading equations for block bistatic scattering are applied, and solutions of the equivalent block parameters are obtained by iteration up to the second order of multiple scattering.

The 1-D inverse scattering problem considered is formulated as a sparse reconstruction problem and convex optimization is applied to super-resolve the profile of discrete point faults in transmission lines. We extend previous results for super-resolution and prove that point faults can be super-resolved exactly with infinite precision in location when there are up to 4 point shunt conductance faults and 5-18 point shunt conductance faults if the faults are separated by λc/2 and λc, respectively, where λc is the minimum wavelength available in the system.

Analytical analysis shows that these generated modes have unique dependencies on distance; therefore, we show that by only measuring the field strength, the range can be accurately estimated without prior calibration. This unique feature arises because the common and difference modes have similar characteristics within the same propagation medium. The proposed method is implemented in the very low frequency spectrum at 6 kHz, which has minimal attenuation and larger penetration depth. The feasibility of the presented approach has been verified through analytical, numerical and experimental results where 20% higher accuracy is obtained compared to the conventional single mode MI approach. Moreover, this methodology overcomes several conventional MI limitations such as the difficulty in obtaining proper calibrations, complex computations, and sensitivity to conductive media.

The approach takes advantage from the linear sampling method, which belongs to the class of qualitative imaging methods, in order to focus the field intensity with respect to different control points belonging to the target. Then, the desired spatial field intensity shaping is obtained by recombining the results from such single-focusing problems and by exploiting an additional degree of freedom, which is represented by phase shifts of the field in the considered control points.

To design the proposed small-aperture DF array, we examined different array topologies that provide elevation and azimuth estimation capabilities and that are immune to errors caused by cross polarization. All of these potential candidates occupy the same volume of 14 × 14 × 5.5 cm3 corresponding to a maximum linear dimension of 19 cm.

Its goal is to reconstruct the shape of conductors from their scattered fields at some distances. When viewed from the pixelated imaging viewpoint, any pixel in the imaging domain is either a conductor or background (air); thus such an inverse scattering problem has binary solutions for all pixels. Under the high-frequency physical optics (PO) approximation, the scattered field is formulated as a linear problem in terms of a local binary shape function. A binary inversion method is proposed for the detection and shape reconstruction of a flat PEC reflector from high-frequency scattered field measurements. To exploit the underlying binary structure, a Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) prior model is employed to perform a binary enforcement mechanism. This binary enforcement mechanism can push each pixel of the inversion domain to have a value equal to either zero or one. Then, the damped generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) is integrated with the proposed prior model to address the binary linear inverse problem from the Bayesian inference perspective. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed BG Binary Inversion method. The performance improvement of the proposed method is attributed to the exploitation of the binary prior information of the solution and GAMP technique.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2952005","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601245,61601242); State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves(grant numbers:K201724); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2016M601693); Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:NY214047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897144","Bayesian inference;Bernoulli–Gaussian (BG) prior model;local shape function (LSF);physics optics (PO)","Inverse problems;Shape;Bayes methods;Imaging;Electromagnetics;Image reconstruction;Electromagnetic scattering","","9","","29","IEEE","12 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The unit cell consists of a bottom linear-polarization patch and a top circular-polarization patch, which are separated by a metalized plane and connected by a metalized via. The bottom patch receives the power and transfers it to the top layer through the metalized via; the top layer then transmits the power into space. The metasurface is designed to have high reflectivity and an appropriate reflection phase to compose a resonate cavity with the ground plane. The capability of linear to circular polarization conversion is provided to the PCM by adjustment of the transmission magnitude and phase. A slot coupled patch antenna is used as the feeder due to its stable broadside radiation. The linearly polarized wave emitting from the feeder resonates in the cavity and then is converted into a CP wave when it comes out of the cavity. A prototype antenna is fabricated and measured. The measurement results show that the antenna has good circular polarization performance within the band of 9.8-10.2 GHz.

Due to tilted electric vectors of the monopole in near fields, both even- and odd-mode SSPPs can be excited. Standing waves of even-mode SSPPs on the SSPPs structure will enable broadside or tilted radiation, while traveling waves of odd-mode SSPPs on the tapered end will enable endfire radiation.

The numerical results verify that the presented array performs well in various charging scenarios, which brings a highly potential insight for far-field WPT.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2930135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8777288","Flexible beamforming;retrodirective arrays (RDAs);single sideband (SSB) modulation;time-modulated arrays (TMAs);wireless power transmission (WPT)","Amplitude modulation;Harmonic analysis;Array signal processing;Phased arrays;Radio frequency","","22","","27","IEEE","26 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the conductor loss of ITO material is the major obstacle to antenna design. In this communication, an optically transparent reflectarray based on glass substrate with ITO film operating at 28 GHz is presented. A novel subwavelength element operating in hybrid modes with 0.167λ0 (λ0 is the free-space wavelength at 28 GHz) spacing is proposed for transparent reflectarray design. The peak loss of the proposed element is below 3.4 dB and a phase variation of 420° is achieved at 28 GHz. A 54 × 54-element reflectarray with a focus to diameter ratio (F/D) of 0.7 is designed and simulated for demonstration. It achieves radiation efficiency higher than 73% at the center operating frequency. The proposed reflectarray is verified by the measurements, which is reasonably consistent with the full-wave simulated results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2943408","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61622104,61721001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8852844","Indium tin oxide (ITO);reflectarray;transparent antenna","Indium tin oxide;Substrates;Conductors;Glass;Optical films;Optical reflection;Antennas","","41","","15","IEEE","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This may be crucial especially when a quick reaction is required before the spatial situation changes. In this work, a novel technique based on the Schelkunoff theory of incorporating nulls into the array factor (AF) expression is presented. It is shown that by introducing these nulls in the AF, the number of unknown array coefficients to be optimized is reduced. Hence, the optimization processing time is considerably decreased compared to the conventional all parameters technique, without impairing other radiation pattern characteristics such as the beamwidth or the side lobe level.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2944550","King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals(grant numbers:SB181021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8859613","Adaptive;antenna arrays;genetic algorithm (GA);Schelkunoff","Linear antenna arrays;Adaptive arrays;Optimization;Antenna theory;Genetic algorithms;Sociology","","9","","27","IEEE","4 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Plenty of fascinating EM phenomena have been generated using metasurface. However, two defects are hindering their development. The first one is that most metasurfaces only perform a specific functionality once designed, which means they do not possess tunable properties. The second defect is that most of them work in either reflection mode or transmission mode, leaving half of the EM space completely unexplored. Therefore, it is challenging to design metasurface with tunability and entire-space working modes simultaneously. Here, a tunable metasuface is presented to solve these problems. The proposed metasurface element is a multilayer structure which can manipulate EM waves in the entire space. Concurrently, p-i-n switches are loaded on each element which can dynamically control transmission and reflection phases. Thus, some intriguing EM modulation functions in the entire space are realized, such as beam forming, anomalous reflection, and diffusion. The simulated and experimental results prove the tunable metasurface. The proposed metasurface offers a feasible strategy to design tunable metadevices and for other related practical applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2929438","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671464,61701523,61801508); Natural Science Foundational Research Fund of Shannxi Province(grant numbers:2017JM6025,2018JM6040,2019JQ103); Doctoral Foundation of Air Force Engineering University (AEFU)(grant numbers:KGD08091901); Postdoctoral Innovative Talents Support Program of China(grant numbers:BX20180375); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M650099); Young Talent fund of University Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi, China(grant numbers:20170107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8889431","Metasurface;reflection;transmission;tunable","Metals;Reflection;Pins;Encoding;PIN photodiodes;Antennas;Periodic structures","","45","","20","IEEE","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The beam-forming functionality is realized through the leaky-wave (LW) conditions of the periodic structure, and the beam reconfiguration at quadrature azimuth angle is triggered by switching between the two operating frequencies. The MTS is formed using a periodic homogeneous array of split ring resonators (SRRs) with anisotropic characteristics. The EM bandgap (EBG) properties and LW conditions of the individual SRRs are combined to produce both beam-forming and beam-reconfiguration functionalities. The subwavelength SRR unit cells are designed such that they satisfy LW theory at 1.8 GHz to form a two-sided beam along azimuth angles 0° and 180° and create a complete EBG at 2.6 GHz to form a two-sided beam along angles 90° and 270° at 2.6 GHz. Both the TE and TM mode responses of the individual SRRs are taken into consideration during the design process. The MTS structure is synthesized and evaluated using full-wave EM simulator and is validated with the experimental results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2943442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8852827","Beam reconfiguration;electromagnetic (EM) bandgap (EBG);leaky wave (LW);metamaterial (MTM);metasurface (MTS);split ring resonator (SRR);two-sided beam","Surface waves;Periodic structures;Surface impedance;Metamaterials;Dispersion;Impedance;Beams","","7","","32","IEEE","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
