All the previously proposed PCSs for ERAs are made using either several expensive radio frequency (RF) dielectric laminates or thick and heavy dielectric materials, contributing to very high fabrication cost, posing an industrial impediment to the application of ERAs. This article presents a new industrial-friendly generation of PCS, in which dielectrics, known as the main cause of high manufacturing cost, are removed from the PCS configuration, introducing an all-metallic PCS (AMPCS). Unlike existing PCSs, a hybrid topology of fully metallic spatial phase shifters are developed for the AMPCS, resulting in an extremely lower prototyping cost as that of other state-of-the-art substrate-based PCSs. The APMCS was fabricated using laser technology and tested with an ERA to verify its predicted performance. The results show that the phase uniformity of the ERA aperture has been remarkably improved, resulting in 8.4 dB improvement in the peak gain of the antenna and improved sidelobe levels (SLLs). The antenna system including APMCS has a peak gain of 19.42 dB with a 1 dB gain bandwidth of around 6%.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2969888","Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship (MQRES) Scheme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9003527","All-metal manufacturing;electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) resonator antenna (ERA);electromagnetic (EM) near-field distribution;Fabry–Perot resonator antenna;frequency-selective surfaces;high gain;laser cutting prototyping;metasurface;phase-correcting surface;phase correction;resonant cavity antenna (RCA)","Directive antennas;Aperture antennas;Fabrication;Dielectrics;Topology","","77","","33","IEEE","19 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The motivation for using N-port CMA is to determine the fundamental resonance characteristics of the pixel antenna geometry and optimize them directly. An advantage of this approach is that it separates the process of antenna resonance optimization from impedance matching. It contrasts directly with conventional optimization approaches based on return loss which implicitly perform impedance matching together with antenna resonance optimization. In our work, an objective function based on modal significance is utilized and genetic optimization is used to optimize the desired characteristics. An efficient method for the implementation of N-port CMA is described which requires only one full-wave simulation of the pixel geometry in the optimization process. Impedance matching is performed as a final step in the design process after optimization of the antenna resonance is completed. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the utility of the approach.

The antenna system has a steering and impedance-matching bandwidth of 40.6% from 26.5 to 40 GHz. A prototype of the beam-steering antenna system including a mechanical system to rotate each of the SPTs around the antenna axis has been fabricated and tested. The rotating SPT pair introduces a predetermined phase gradient to the input near-field and creates an output near-field that will radiate in an arbitrarily selected direction, which can be varied within a large conical region with a maximum apex angle of 104°. The system exhibits predicted and measured peak gains of 21.5 and 21.25 dBi, respectively, and the measured gain variation over 2-D beam steering is less than 3 dB except at 36 and 39 GHz, where it rises to 3.6 and 3.1 dB, respectively.

The design method is based on the adiabatic approximate solution for the hybrid mode of a conical waveguide with generic balanced impedance walls, which allows the determination of the impedance profile supporting a single balanced mode. The impedance design is based on the usual locally flat approximation of the wall and on the assumption of plane wave incidence. This approach results in an analytic design method that requires no optimization. The design has been first validated by solving the problem with homogenized impedance boundary conditions through a body of revolution (BoR) method of moments. The actual structure, including impedance wall implementation, is then simulated in full detail with a full-wave fast code.

A T-shaped monopole intersects with a T-shaped slot that is etched on a large ground edge, constituting the CPW-fed dual antenna pair. By exploiting the odd and even modes of the CPW structure, two orthogonal characteristic modes including the in-phase current and monopole modes can be excited, generating high port isolation. Both modes are unbalanced mode, which means that the ground currents can be fully excited, so the two antennas are with balanced high performance. A sub-6 GHz antenna pair that occupies a footprint of 15 × 7 mm2 (0.18 λ × 0.08 λ) is analyzed and the simulated results show an isolation of better than -24 dB and an envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) of lower than 0.0016, -6 dB bandwidths of 230 and 240 MHz, and average efficiencies of 57.9% and 57.4%. A four-antenna multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array is fabricated and measured to verify the feasibility. The measured isolations and ECCs of the two modes are, respectively, better than -20.0 dB and 0.04, -6 dB bandwidths are 230 MHz/240 MHz and 220 MHz/230 MHz, and average efficiencies are 54.5%/50.2% and 49.9%/48.6%.

The switching of the stub alters the impedance loading of the antenna, leading to a change in the propagation constant and thus the main beam angle. The input impedance of the stubs is chosen for symmetrical beam scanning through the broadside direction. A total of 50 distinct main beam positions with an angular separation of approximately 1° are selected from the different switching states using an iterative process.

The antenna is designed for body-surface repeater solutions and it addresses the problem of marginal into-body deep tissue communication links, where power consumption is of the utmost importance and system link efficiency is critical. Under realistic operation conditions, the antenna's circular polarization (CP) successfully mitigates implant orientation and polarization mismatch. Polarization loss for linear antennas can be up to 16 dB in anechoic environments and as much as 12.5 dB in a realistic multipath environment, as demonstrated by measured co- and cross-polar forward path gain between implanted and linearly polarized surface antennas. To overcome the body-isolating effect of an antenna ground plane and to produce an effective off-body mode, a novel dual-aperture stripline feed was developed which also improves the body-mounted antenna radiation efficiency. The antenna provides a 0 dBi off-body gain while still maintaining excellent into-body performance. The into-body link was shown to exhibit CP with a maximum isolation of only 1.5 dB between co- and cross-polar measurements in the 2.36-2.4 GHz band.

The motivation intends to enhance the electromagnetic (EM) power reception by receiving antennas (RXAs) of relatively large sizes. Instead of enforcing an equal-phase radiation focusing at a single NFF point, which loses the freedom of phase control, the CNFF concept considers the wavefront of RXA radiation to design a CNFF antenna (CNFFA) for better power transfer. Its radiation produces a proper phase distribution in a customized fashion, which is conformal to the wavefront of selected RXA's radiation in the near-zone. The development considers power transfer between the CNFFA and RXA by defining a convenient power reaction factor (PRF) on the reaction equation, which naturally constructs a relationship between the CNFFA's excitations and an RXA. The intention to maximize the PRF in the reaction equation results in the conformal radiation characteristics of the CNFFA. In this study, the concept and design guidelines are presented, which are validated via theoretical and numerical simulations of practical examples. This concept is particularly useful for wireless power transfer at high frequencies where geometric optic (GO) interpretation of wave propagation is valid.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2963557","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:MOST-107-2218-E-002-050); National Taiwan University, Taiwan(grant numbers:108L893702); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8952897","Conformal antenna radiation;near-field focus (NFF) communication;phased array of antennas;reaction theorem;wireless power transfer","Phased arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Wireless power transfer;Electromagnetic propagation;Numerical analysis","","17","","43","IEEE","8 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The HM consists of an anisotropic frequency-selective absorber (AFSA) and a polarization rotation reflective surface (PRRS). The proposed AFSA absorbs the electromagnetic wave for one polarization while letting the cross-polarized wave pass through. When putting the PRRS under AFSA, the cross-polarized wave will be reflected by the PRRS with 90° polarization rotation and then the reflected wave will be absorbed by AFSA. Thus, both the co-polarized and cross-polarized incident waves are absorbed by HM. Because the incident energy is absorbed rather than reflected to the other directions, both the monostatic RCS and bistatic RCS are reduced in a wide frequency band. In addition, since the radiation wave emitted by the slot array antenna will not be reflected by the PRRS, the proposed antenna has a reasonable gain. The simulated results show that both the monostatic RCS and bistatic RCS of the proposed slot array antenna are significantly reduced in the frequency range from 6 to 18 GHz and the gain decreases about only 0.8 dB when compared with the reference antenna.

In this article, we suggest the use of “half-way dual” fields for extending the range of problems that can be addressed in this way. To this end, a workable expression for the fractional curl operator of order one-half is derived. While general expressions for fractional derivatives are purely formal and hard to implement, the special case of electromagnetic fields enables substantial simplification that leads to this closed form expression. It is then used to formulate a four-field set of Maxwell-type equations that include two half-way dual fields in addition to the original E and H.

Equivalent medium theory (EMT) is used to realize necessary dielectric constant of each layer by using asymmetric Brugemans's (ABG) formula. The radome layers are fabricated by perforating numerous holes in the host material with diameters sufficiently smaller than the wavelength. Properly sticking different layers together forms the final radome geometry. The designed radome is verified with free-space measurement setup. The measurement results are in good agreement with simulations and shows low insertion loss and high stability in wide aspect angle range for both TE and TM polarizations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2970020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979258","Equivalent medium;high angular stability;inhomogeneous radomes;perforating the host medium;periodic structures","Radomes;Nonhomogeneous media;Permittivity;Dielectrics;Bandwidth;Mathematical model","","7","","40","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, based on the transmission line (TL) model, the relationship between polarization states and different sheet resistance of graphene has been investigated in detail. Four prototypes have been fabricated based on the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) -grown graphene, which has the desired sheet resistance of 10, 150, 300, and 1000 Ω/sq.

Here, we propose a programmable multifunctional spoof SPP device by loading varactor diodes between adjacent metallic teeth of SPP waveguides. By programming the bias voltages of the varactor diodes dynamically, the coupling waves propagating on two SPP waveguides can be freely controlled. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the programmable SPP device can realize high-efficiency SPP through transmission, unequal coupling, 3 dB direction coupling, and crossover transmission with better isolation effect.

For the problem, the restriction of the Babinet principle is mainly resulted from the inhomogeneity of the different substrates or the anisotropy of the metallic elements. In order to break the restriction, a virtual substrate with an effective permittivity is inserted into the interface to cover Ae and Ac as an updated physical boundary condition. As the thickness of such a virtual effective substrate layer approaches zero, the updated model will not only remain the same as the original one for Ae and Ac but also can be solved by the existing Babinet principle with a feasible mathematical method. Finally, according to the network transmission theory and Babinet principle, the proposed theory gives the specific mathematical relationship between the tangential transmission matrices of Ae and Ac.

Therefore, the development of hypersonic vehicle relies on a clear understanding of the strong interaction between the surrounding plasma and the incident electromagnetic wave. However, because of the presence of complex geometrical features and heterogeneous media, these applications are often multiscale. The modeling of such applications in 3-D is extremely challenging for traditional numerical methods. In this work, an efficient discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method for the 3-D modeling of plasma-surrounded hypersonic vehicles is presented. To overcome the grid-induced stiffness problem arising from the modeling of such multiscale applications with dispersive media, and to improve the modeling efficiency, a high-order exponential-based time integration for the time-domain Maxwell's equations discretized by DG schemes with a general flux formulation is proposed. This time integration has excellent stability properties in the locally refined part of the mesh and hence enables the usage of larger time steps compared with the explicit time marching scheme. Additionally, the exponential-based time integration is developed to adapt an anisotropic perfectly matched layer for the modeling of open-domain problems. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to investigate the accuracy and convergence properties and to demonstrate the well-modeling capability of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2963923","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61301054); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8954924","3-D multiscale problems;discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method;dispersive media;exponential-based time integration;grid-induced stiffness;time-domain Maxwell’s equations","Plasmas;Media;Time-domain analysis;Mathematical model;Dispersion;Maxwell equations;Numerical models","","13","","47","IEEE","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on the application of the Crank-Nicolson scheme to only one of Maxwell curl equations which leads to an unconditionally stable finite-difference solution of the 3-D vector wave equation in the time domain. The method is designated as a single field because only the electric (or magnetic) field is updated in each time step. The implicit equations for each time step can be solved using a tridiagonal matrix algorithm without a need for matrix inversion. To achieve this, we introduced a new modified time-splitting scheme for the multilevel difference equations. Unlike the existing time-splitting method used to solve such equations which results in instability when dealing with inhomogeneous media, the presented method remains stable. As an important feature of the proposed US-SF-FDTD method, the updating of the three field components can be executed simultaneously (in parallel) by applying multithreading, thereby significantly reducing runtime. The unconditional stability of the proposed method is proved analytically.

In sharp contrast, little is known of the accuracy of the NA and WA-SMPEs in the transformed coordinates. It was thought that the WA-SMPE is entirely superior to the NA-SMPE according to the behavior in the NA and WA propagators. In this article, we analyze the accuracy of the WA and NA-SMPEs in the transformed coordinates through studying their artificial dispersion properties. It is found that the artificial dispersion of the NA-SMPE is independent of the terrain parameters, whereas for the WA-SMPE, the dependence of the dispersion characteristics on the terrain slope is very strong. Also, as the terrain slope increases, its WA capability deteriorates dramatically. Particularly, when the shady terrain slope is larger than about 5°, the accuracy of the WA-SMPE is even worse than the NA-SMPE. To substantiate the accuracy analysis, numerical experiments involving wave propagation over irregular terrain are also presented.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2963903","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771389); Pre-research Foundation of Weapons Equipment of China(grant numbers:61405180202); Doctoral Innovation Fund of the Xi’an University of Technology(grant numbers:310-252071710); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8954943","Dispersion properties;narrow angle (NA);shift-map (SM) parabolic equation (PE) (SMPE);transformed coordinates;wide angle (WA)","Dispersion;Mathematical model;Antennas;Surface waves;Indexes;Earth;Taylor series","","7","","24","IEEE","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent studies have demonstrated that multi-antenna systems can leverage signal-level exposure models to jointly mitigate user radiation absorption and achieve high data rates. This is especially important for millimeter wave technologies, which are susceptible to power back-off techniques due to high propagation and blockage losses. However, prior models require significant overhead in the form of exposure measurements to compute model parameters and cannot be easily modified to predict electromagnetic absorption in different testing configurations. This article proposes methods to approximate the characteristic matrix of a quadratic model for two exposure measures in the millimeter wave band: incident power density and surface specific absorption rate (SAR). The presented models can be calculated with a small number of parameters and can be altered to account for mutual coupling, near-field effects, and changes in the exposure scenario. Spatial sampling schemes based on these models are derived to determine how many testing points are necessary to estimate exposure in a region within a specified margin of error. Software simulation results with half-wave dipoles validate the accuracy of the proposed models in a millimeter wave scenario.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2946742","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1403458,CNS-1642982); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8871335","5G Communication;electromagnetic absorption;millimeter wave communication;power density (PD);spatial sampling;specific absorption rate (SAR)","Millimeter wave technology;Millimeter wave measurements;Millimeter wave communication;Computational modeling;Absorption;Wireless communication;Surface waves","","10","","51","IEEE","16 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method utilizes the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm to calculate the Poynting localized energy for any antenna by working directly with computed fields, rather than source currents. It is established that this localized energy is fundamentally different from the classical antenna reactive energy associated with frequency-domain Q-factors of electrically small antennas. The proposed localized energy theory leads to the formulation of new performance evaluation measures, effectively going beyond traditional S-parameters and far-field patterns, which are then applied in several design examples involving strongly coupled arrays and weakly coupled antenna systems. It was found that gain enhancement caused by strong mutual coupling in the near zone (directors in Yagi-Uda systems or split-ring resonator arrays) is closely correlated with localized energy enhancement (but such correlation does not hold in weak mutual coupling scenarios). The new performance metrics are also used to generate spatial distributions for energy localization in MIMO printed dipoles. We propose that this proposed localized energy concept and the apparatus developed to investigate its relevant new data can assist in implementation of ultrahigh gain closely spaced antenna elements needed for the upcoming sub-6 GHz/mmWave 5G MIMO systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2951992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994155","Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD);gain enhancement;near-field","Time-domain analysis;Antenna measurements;Finite difference methods;Antenna arrays;Energy storage","","15","","51","IEEE","11 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method is free of probe compensation since the probe is stationary and the antenna under test (AUT) is in the QFF range, which makes the measurements equivalent to FF measurements. The measurement distance required by the proposed approach only needs to satisfy the FF condition and QFF condition for the relatively smaller dimension and larger dimension of the AUT, respectively.

The method offers several advantages over the use of traditional dense Nyquist-spaced arrays, while maintaining a comparable algorithmic complexity for the analysis. Among the advantages we mention: an improved resolution for the same number of receivers and reduced mutual coupling effects between the receivers, both due to the increased separation between the antennas. Because of a shared structured linear system of equations between the two arrays, as a consequence of the shift between the two, the analysis of both is automatically paired, thereby avoiding a computationally expensive matching step as is required in the use of so-called co-prime arrays. In addition, an easy validation step allows to automatically detect the precise number of incoming signals, which is usually considered a difficult issue. At the same time, the validation step improves the accuracy of the retrieved results and eliminates unreliable results in the case of noisy data.

One of the most important indicators in evaluating the performance of HAD beamforming systems is the measurement of the sub-array radiation patterns. However, as the number of elements increases, the number of combinations that can create sub-arrays increases significantly, and the conventional radiation pattern measurement process becomes exhaustive. However, when an orthogonal coded signal is used for the HAD beamforming system measurement, the magnitude and phase information of each element of the HAD beamforming system, including mutual coupling, can be simultaneously obtained from a single scan. Hence, it is possible to measure all feasible sub-array patterns very efficiently. Therefore, we propose an orthogonal code-based time-domain measurement technique and validate it with full-wave time-domain simulations.

In this article, a general physical understanding of this otherwise “pure mathematical” method is given for the first time. Such an interpretation is derived from the relationship between the currents induced in the investigated scenario and the so-called reduced scattered field, which is the core of the orthogonality sampling indicator function. Interestingly, the nature of such a relationship implies that the reduced scattered field can be related to the radiating component of the induced currents. A direct consequence of such a result is that the OSM is capable of imaging discontinuities within the unknown targets and hence identify regions with different electromagnetic properties. This possibility represents a unique feature among qualitative inverse scattering methods, as these latter have been introduced as tools to image just the external shape of the unknown targets. The new interpretation as well as the above distinctive capability of the OSM are proved with examples on both simulated and experimental data.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2963229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8951441","Inverse scattering problem;microwave imaging (MWI);orthogonality sampling method (OSM);shape reconstruction","Imaging;Inverse problems;Electromagnetics;Sampling methods;Shape;Scattering;Green's function methods","","39","","43","IEEE","7 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method is based on low-cost inkjet-printed square-check-patterned chipless tags, whose design is explicitly optimized keeping the randomness inherent to the inkjet-printing process in view. These optimized chipless tags are very difficult to duplicate, as their unique backscattered EM responses depend on proximate coupling among the possible separated squares that happened naturally due to the randomness of inkjet printing. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed by a low-cost impulse radio (IR) UWB chipless RFID reader as well as by the highly accurate VNA-based chipless RFID reader. The achieved probability of error is comparable to the various fingerprint evaluation campaigns found in the literature.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2948740","Université Grenoble Alpes; Région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes; Institut Universitaire de France; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:772539); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8884654","Authentication technology;fabrication tolerance;fully printable chipless RFID;inkjet printing;radar approach;randomness","Authentication;Ink jet printing;RFID tags;Substrates;Geometry;Optimization","","22","","28","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Starting from a limited set of NF samples acquired on a finite cylindrical probing surface and by exploiting some a priori information on the class of antennas under test (AUTs) to build an overcomplete dictionary of field bases, the proposed method allows one to accurately extrapolate the data well beyond the physical extension of the NF measurement area. Afterward, a compressive sensing (CS)-based method is successfully applied to retrieve a sparse representation of the actual field distribution over the redundant dictionary at hand. Selected results from a wide numerical analysis are shown to assess the effectiveness and the potentialities of the proposed measurement technique.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2949363","SNATCH Project (2017–2019); Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Project “ASI.EPT.COM”; Italian Space Agency (ASI)(grant numbers:2018-3-HH.0 (CUP: F91I17000020005)); “WATERTECH”(grant numbers:SCN 00489); Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research, and the Project Fundamental Theory and Key Techniques of EM Radiation and Scattering(grant numbers:CUP: E44G14000060008); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61721001); Department of Excellence Program; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8887520","Antenna measurements;compressive sensing (CS);cylindrical set-up;NF/FF transformation","Noise measurement;Antenna measurements;Dictionaries;Finite wordlength effects;Wavelength measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Extrapolation","","18","","22","IEEE","30 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The measurements were conducted in vegetated areas of typical residential environments in Daejeon, South Korea. We first propose a pattern matching algorithm that allows us to overcome the angle resolution of a directional antenna and to estimate a more accurate receiving angle. Then propagation paths received from the vegetation and the surrounding buildings are classified and their power ratios are analyzed. Furthermore, foliage attenuation was determined from the measurement data according to the foliage depth, and appropriate models based on the modified exponential decay (MED) model and the maximum attenuation (MA) model are presented. In addition, the effect of foliage attenuation on seasonal variation is studied. These results will be useful for predicting path losses through the vegetated areas at 28 GHz by modeling the foliage loss as an additional path loss term. Finally, spatial-temporal channel characteristics in a vegetated environment were statistically analyzed including delay spread, coherence bandwidth, and angular spreads.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2968801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976427","28 GHz;foliage;millimeter-wave (mm-wave);pattern matching;vegetation","Antenna measurements;Vegetation;Attenuation;Loss measurement;Attenuation measurement;Pattern matching;Buildings","","14","","15","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed metasurface consists of an array of 4 × 4 square rings. Square solar cells are mounted inside each square ring. Characteristic mode analysis (CMA) is used to analyze the modal behavior of the metasurface. The results demonstrate that the solar cells inside the square rings have a slight influence on the metasurface antenna. This arrangement not only enables total exposure of the solar cells to sunlight but also exhibits no degradation of performance of the antenna. Then, by using a proper feeding structure to excite the selected modes, the CP omnidirectional radiation pattern is realized. The proposed antenna, with and without solar cells, is fabricated and measured. The results demonstrate that the proposed antenna with and without solar cells realizes a similar impedance bandwidth and a similar CP bandwidth. Furthermore, the radiation efficiencies of the metasurface antennas with and without solar cells are similar.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2949713","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61721001,61871079); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2018GZ0230,2018JY0554); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2019Z009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8889520","Circularly polarized (CP) antenna;metasurface;omnidirectional;solar cell","Photovoltaic cells;Resonant frequency;Magnetic fields;Substrates;Antenna radiation patterns;Dielectrics","","40","","27","IEEE","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
