The quasi-nondiffractive beam with considerable and stable depth of field can be steered within the front hemisphere of the antenna by mechanically rotating two PSSs.

The LWA is implemented with glide-symmetric holes in gap-waveguide technology. The radiation is produced through a slit and controlled with glide-symmetric holes. The low dispersion is achieved thanks to the use of a dispersive prism that compensates the frequency dependence of the radiation through the slit. The main innovation of our proposed design is the use of substrate integrated holes (SIHs) to implement the dispersive prism. This implementation significantly enhances the bandwidth and improves the robustness to manufacturing tolerances. Also, this implementation reduces the cost of the antenna while maintaining low losses since the majority of the propagation inside the prism is in air. Additionally, we demonstrate that the use of glide-symmetric holes in the slit allows for a better control of the amount of radiation (attenuation constant) when compared with conventional holes. The differences in the attenuation constant between conventional and glide-symmetric holes have been studied with a multimodal analysis.

An L-shaped slot and a vertical metal strip, fed by the same microstrip line, simultaneously excite the antenna. Using this feeding method, a dual-band, dual-sense CP triangular DRA is obtained by employing the DRA mode excited at the lower band and the hybrid mode excited at the upper band. Building on this initial design, a rotationally symmetric bowtie DRA (bDRA) consisting of two triangular dielectrics is proposed for wideband dual-sense CP operation. An additional excited slot mode widens impedance bandwidth and broadens the axial-ratio bandwidth (ARBW) of the lower band. Meanwhile, a higher order DRA mode excitation widens the ARBW of the higher band. The characteristics of these two DRAs are explored via simulation. Moreover, a bDRA prototype is fabricated and measured.

Big period cascaded by the three different unit cells is introduced for producing a relatively narrow radiation beam. Almost same radiation angle of the antenna is obtained regardless of the permutation of unit cells, which provides more design freedom on antenna structure. Slotting and pins loading technique are applied in unit cells for canceling the reactance of the big period, thus a continuous beam scanning with small gain fluctuation around broadside direction could be achieved. The prototype is fabricated and measured, demonstrating the feasibility of this novel periodic antenna design and well agreement between simulated and measured results.

A very compact composite feed consisting of a pair of dipoles and a conical horn is designed to illuminate a shaped axially displaced ellipse (ADE) reflector antenna. At the higher frequency band, the antenna is a classical ADE design. But at the lower frequency band, it is actually a single reflector. The main reflector acts as a back cavity for the lower band dipole pair which is fed by a coaxial cavity with a length of only 5/8 wavelength and the subreflector works like a director of the low-band feed.

In order to shorten the printing duration of the array that is related to the fabrication costs, components with novel self-supporting geometries in the printing process, including a waveguide-fed ME-dipole radiating element, a 1-to-4 power divider acting as the subarray feed, and a full-corporate E-plane waveguide feed network, are investigated. Benefitted from these components, the entire array configuration can be fulfilled by employing a time-saving printing scheme, which leads to a 15% reduction in the printing duration for an $8 \times 8$ array, and the reduction can be further increased to 40% for a $16 \times 16$ design in comparison with the reported 3-D printed Ka-band arrays with same sizes that were fabricated by using the traditional printing scheme. Simultaneously, excellent operating characteristics, including a wide bandwidth of 32.4%, a maximum gain of 27.1 dBi, and stable unidirectional radiation, are also confirmed experimentally by an $8 \times 8$ prototype of the proposed array.

First, an UWB CP antenna element using circular-arc-shaped monopole (CASM) with asymmetric ground plane is proposed. Characteristic mode analysis (CMA) is used to investigate its CP operating mechanism, providing physical insights into different modes (mode currents and characteristic radiation fields) at various frequencies. The CMA results show that the asymmetric ground plane makes great contribution to produce CP radiation in the lower frequency band, while another upper CP band is generated by CASM. Thus, the overall 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) of the element can be significantly expanded. Furthermore, a  $2 \times 2$  UWB CP array is designed based on this element. A gradient artificial magnetic conductor (GAMC) with a metal cone is adopted to realize both a low-profile ( $0.1 \times \lambda $ , where  $\lambda $  is the air-free wavelength at lowest frequency) and the high-gain radiation for the first time. To validate this novel configuration, this array is fabricated and measured. The measured bandwidth ( $\vert S_{11} \vert < -10$  dB, AR < 3 dB) is approximately 92.3% (1.75–4.75 GHz). It also achieves a wide 3 dB gain bandwidth of 72.3%. Both the simulated and measured results demonstrate that this low-profile high-gain antenna array is promising for applications in wireless systems such as mobile satellite communication system.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2998922","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871324); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/N032497/1,EP/P015840/1,EP/S005625/1); Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program(grant numbers:BX20180003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109654","Antenna array;artificial magnetic conductor (AMC);characteristic mode analysis (CMA);circularly polarized (CP);ultra-wideband (UWB)","Antenna arrays;Microstrip antennas;Broadband antennas;Microstrip;Bandwidth;Antenna feeds","","42","","44","IEEE","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This solution is based on a gap waveguide array antenna and a reconfigurable transmitarray (TA) that are coupled in the radiative near field. An equivalent two-port network model of the coupling mechanism is presented and validated numerically. The desired TA reconfiguration capability is realized by an 8 × 8 array of cavity-backed patch resonator elements, where two AlGaAs p-i-n diodes are integrated inside each element providing a 1-bit phase shift. The TA is implemented in an eight-layer printed circuit board (PCB), which includes radiating elements, fixed phase-shifting innerstripline sections, impedance matching, and biasing circuitry. The combined antenna design is low profile (~1.7 wavelength) owing to the small separation between two arrays (~0.5 wavelength), as opposed to conventional TAs illuminated by a focal source. The design procedure of the proposed architecture is outlined, and the measured and simulated results are shown to be in good agreement. These results demonstrate 23.5-25.2 GHz -10-dB impedance bandwidth and 23.3-25.3 GHz 3-dB gain bandwidth, a beam-steering range of ±30° and ±40° in the E- and the H-planes with the gain peak of 17.5 dBi, scan loss ≤ 3.5 dB, and TA unit cell insertion loss ≤ 1.8 dB, respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2998904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109659","1-bit phase-shifting;array lens;discrete lens;gap waveguide (GWG);phased antenna array (PAA);transmitarray (TA)","Phased arrays;Feeds;Beam steering;Couplings;Phase control","","35","","47","IEEE","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These stub-loaded SW-TL feed networks are seamlessly integrated with uniformly spaced microstrip patch arrays. The desired Dolph-Chebyshev excitations are realized simply by modulating the widths of their stubs.

Previous articles have proposed both physical phenomena and propagation models for this problem, but few articles have analyzed random fluctuations of EM waves propagating through plumes from a communications perspective. This article attempts to attach these fluctuations, which are caused by the plume-induced turbulent plasma spread medium, to the communications channel characteristics. A multi-parameter stochastic model is established to characterize the exhaust plume channel in which the first-order and the second-order statistical properties are presented. Accordingly, a ground firing test was conducted to validate the EM wave propagation characteristics and the channel characteristics. The experimental results are in good consistence with the theoretical results. The results indicated that the time-varying envelope of the transmitted EM waves obeys a log-normal distribution, whereas the time-varying phase shift obeys a normal distribution. Moreover, the time-frequency analysis method was applied to evaluate the EM-plume interactions in the time-frequency domain. These results are critical for designing the rocket communication systems and evaluating the systems performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2999661","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771370,61871302,61627901,61601353); Shaanxi National Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019JZ-15); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9112670","Channel characteristics;electromagnetic (EM) propagation in random plasma media;exhaust plume fading channel;turbulent plasma properties","Plasmas;Fluctuations;Time-frequency analysis;Propagation;Mathematical model;Time-domain analysis;Rockets","","12","","35","IEEE","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method has its roots in the surface equivalence principle, according to which the scattering due to an object can alternatively be represented by putting induced current sources (electric or magnetic) on its surface and then assumed to radiate in an open medium (physical equivalent) or in the presence of the cylinder (induction equivalence). Using this, a cylindrical object is approximated by a circular array obtained by discretizing the induced current. The scattered field is then represented as field radiated by the circular array. Using this representation, it is now possible to tailor the scattering pattern of a cylinder by placing another circular array concentric to the original cylindrical object and controlling its excitation magnitude and phases. In this way, the proposed method also leads to a generalization of the active cloaking concept, in which the excitation amplitude of concentric circular array is negative of that induced on the original cylindrical obstacle’s surface. The method is applied both for plane wave and line-source scattering of infinitely long conducting as well as dielectric cylinders and verified by COMSOL simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2999749","Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), India(grant numbers:IMP/2018/000043); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9112673","Active cloak;circular array;induction equivalent;physical equivalent;RADAR;scattering cross section;surface equivalence principle","Phased arrays;Current density;Electromagnetic scattering;Surface waves;Dielectrics;Magnetosphere","","4","","27","IEEE","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, an improved thin dielectric sheet-based method of moments is presented to model the scattering from the multiple and multilayer thin medium-coated objects. As a result, only unknowns exist on the target’s outer surface, and the computational resources can significantly be saved in comparison with solvers that associate unknowns with all the surfaces and interfaces. It should also be noted that the half RWG basis functions are introduced at the interface of different media for multiple medium-coated conductors. Finally, both the mean value and variance of the scattering electric current are derived by applying a perturbation approach to account for the target’s uncertain variable geometry.

The PSE scheme alleviates the need for highly accurate and intricate forward and inverse EM field solvers and mitigates the introduction of numerical errors in addition to the unavoidable experimental uncertainties.

As a proof of concept and to develop insight, an EM-circuit co-simulation is presented to show that the received signal contains a signature of the logic circuit under test, which is imprinted on the relative power levels of the modulated scattered clock harmonics.

The main dish of a push-broom antenna is generated by rotating a section of a parabola about a tilt axis, forming a ring focus around the axis. Such a ring focus enables one to place multiple feeds to a single reflector to create multibeams for imaging. Currently, the synthesis of such a system is based on either geometrical optics or physical optics. However, since so many feeds are used and each beam has to be evaluated, these methods are less competent in the design of such an antenna. This communication builds a direct link between the output beam and the geometrical parameters of the feeds and the main reflector. Such a link is established using the Gaussian beam and beam transformation theories. This method gives one a quick estimation of the output performance and good starting values for optimization. Additionally, a complete mathematic description of the reflector and feed design is provided.

The periodic element consists of a quarter-mode substrate integrated waveguide (QMSIW) cavity surrounded by two identical loop slots located on the top and bottom layers of the cavity. Two transmission poles and one transmission zero are caused by the fundamental mode in the QMSIW cavity, the slot mode, and the coupling between them, respectively. By precisely tuning the dual-mode configuration, the proposed FSS shows a wide passband with a good transmission efficiency and a rapid roll-off at the high side of the operation band due to the transmission zero. With the QMSIW-based miniaturized elements, the FSS is also insensitive to a large angle of incidence. Thanks to the novel structure, several higher order modes close to the target band are suppressed, making the parasitic passband far away from both sides of the designed band. To verify the advantages, a prototype operated at 10 GHz is fabricated and tested. The measured results show a wide passband performance with the 1/3 dB relative bandwidths of 34%/49% for normal incidence, which agree well with the simulated results. Besides, the 3 dB bandwidth still remains 23% for the incident angle of 60°.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2998220","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61871088,61631012); National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1801505); Project of Special Zone for National Defense Science and Technology Innovation; China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9107424","Frequency selective surface (FSS);quarter-mode substrate integrated waveguide (QMSIW);wide-angle;wideband","Frequency selective surfaces;Passband;Scattering parameters;Resonant frequency;Wideband;Substrates","","22","","42","IEEE","3 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition of the S-HIE-FDTD depends on the spatial discretization sizes only in two dimensions; therefore, for computation domains with fine geometric features only in the remaining dimension, it uses a time step size that is larger than that of fully explicit schemes.

The voxel-based variational Born iterative method (VBIM) is combined with the maximum entropy thresholding (MET) technique to reconstruct 3-D irregular scatterers embedded in the layered media. In each iteration, the VBIM first outputs the model parameters in discretized cells of the inversion domain, and the MET is then used to categorize them into “background” and “scatterer” types. Partial “background” cells will be removed in the next round iteration according to an adjustable threshold corresponding to the maximum entropy since they have no contribution to the measured scattered fields. Consequently, the inversion domain is gradually downsized in the successive iterations. The computation efficiency, memory cost, and the reconstruction accuracy are compared for VBIM with and without the MET.

Toward this end, the inverse problem at hand is recast to the minimization of the augmented Lagrangian function, and then it is efficiently solved by means of a novel accelerated total-variation CS (ATV-CS) approach. The ATV-CS, which is based on a smart implementation of the involved matrix-vector multiplications, is exploited to remarkably reduce the computational cost of the standard total variation (TV)-CS so that a reliable and efficient prediction of the FS is enabled in realistic applications concerned with wide areas, as well.

In this communication, a field-shaping method based on angular spectrum projection and the linear superposition principle is presented. The proposed method allows radiated electric fields to be shaped with different desired intensity patterns in a given limited target area with the use of the same antenna array. Via this method, all element excitations of the antenna array can be analytically calculated, and not only is the element excitation computational time reduced, but the real-time control of shaped fields is also made possible. Full-wave simulations were carried out to illustrate the 1-D and 2-D electric field shaping within a small given target area. In the 1-D case, three types of shaped fields with different desired distributions are demonstrated. In the 2-D case, three kinds of origin-symmetric shaped fields with different intensity distributions are illustrated. Finally, shaped fields with more complicated 2-D intensity distributions, like “I”- and “X”-shaped patterns, are demonstrated, and are achieved directly by applying the linear superposition principle to multiple point-focused fields with spatially overlapping focal spots.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2995362","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671133); Sichuan Applied Basic Research Project(grant numbers:19YYJC0025); 2018 Open Fund Project of the Guangxi Key Laboratory of Wireless Wideband Communication and Signal Processing(grant numbers:PF18190X); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099435","Electric field shaping;field synthesis;point-focused field","Electric fields;Optimization;Attenuation;Frequency-domain analysis;Phased arrays","","21","","28","IEEE","25 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is in good agreement with the time-consuming methods such as the finite-element method (FEM) and the method of moment (MoM) while it has an appropriate computational efficiency especially when the width of a groove increases.

This gap in the uncertainty analysis is closed by simulating a measurement scenario via spherical wave expansion. Thereby, the actual measurement sequence is imitated by using the matrix-vector representation of an antenna measurement. The spherical mode coefficients of the antenna under test held by the vector are mathematically rotated step by step and repeatedly multiplied by the field within the test zone which is represented by the coefficients in the matrix. As the technique is applicable to far-field and near-field data, the evaluation of antenna measurements is considered in general, and the emulation of a measurement process is exemplary carried out for a compact antenna test range.
