This unfetters the optimization process and can lead to potentially new designs due to the increased degree of freedom afforded.

The lens is sliced into multiple shells and each shell comprises of several triangular unit cells, and then the permittivity variation is achieved by manipulating the wall thickness of each triangular unit cells after the QICO discretization. Such a QICO model is firstly proposed to be used in LL design, which not only makes the lens mechanically robust and manufacturing-friendly (no support is needed in the processing) but also enables the antenna to be polarization insensitive and thus can sustain CP beams very well. A wideband ridged waveguide feed is selected to initiate left-handed CP (LHCP) and right-handed CP (RHCP) beams simultaneously. To prove the concept, a prototype was fabricated using 3-D-printing (3DP) technologies. The measurement results reveal an overlapped bandwidth of 33.1% (26.5-37 GHz) in terms of reflection coefficients lower than -10 dB and axial ratios smaller than 3 dB.

First, a set of shorting pins is loaded around the edge of the patch with decreased width, aiming to suppress undesired nonbroadside modes. Second, the far-zone radiated fields of the antenna are theoretically studied by using equivalent magnetic currents (EMCs). The results demonstrate that its broadside |Eθ|, |Eφ|, and -|Eθ| components of xoz plane radiation patterns could be orthogonally generated under TM1/2,0, TM1/2,1, and TM3/2,0 modes, respectively. Most importantly, these three broadside EMCs must be sequentially rotated. Third, the resonant frequencies of these triple radiative modes (f1/2,0, f1/2,1, and f3/2,0) are extensively analyzed and reallocated by loading the shorting pins. It proves that the f1/2,0 and f1/2,1 could be progressively pushed up to around the f3/2,0, resulting in generating the CP radiation as expected. With these arrangements, the AR-bandwidth of the proposed CP antenna is significantly widened under triple-mode resonance. In final, the proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. Simulated and measured results are in good agreement with each other. The measured results depict that the CP antenna has acquired an enhanced AR-bandwidth with two minima poles, covering a fractional bandwidth of about 5% from 3.25 to 3.41 GHz, which is about 3.3 times wider than the traditional counterpart (1.5%). Besides, its profile is kept only about 0.03 free-space wavelength.

A substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) is periodically loaded with closed (nonradiative) discontinuities acting as a bandpass filter, where the lower and higher stopbands are, respectively, stemmed from the SIW natural cutoff and the Bragg effect bandgap or bandstop caused by periodic discontinuities. By adequately adjusting the periodicity of filter unit cells and loading effects of closed discontinuities, filtering and dispersion behaviors of the periodic SIW can be flexibly engineered. Open (radiative) discontinuities are then deliberately introduced into the bandpass filter to generate a controllable radiation leakage, thereby accomplishing the design of the RBPF, i.e., the proposed LWA. With this concept, both filtering/dispersion and radiation tasks can be independently managed by different modules for LWAs. For demonstration purposes, two kinds of closed discontinuities, namely nonradiative longitudinal slot-pair (capacitive) and iris (inductive), are separately exploited for periodic SIWs with bandpass and high dispersion characteristics, whereas transverse slot (open discontinuity) is mainly aimed for radiation leakage. Two RBPF-based LWAs are simulated, fabricated, and measured. The simulated and measured results are in a reasonable agreement, and both demonstrate the rapid beam-scanning and filtering behaviors, thereby validating the proposed concept.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2984923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9059037","Bandpass filter;beam-scanning rate;Bragg effects;discontinuities;dispersion engineering;electromagnetic bandgap (EBG);filtering antenna;group delay;group delay dispersion (GDD);leaky-wave antenna (LWA);periodic structure;substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW)","Periodic structures;Metamaterials;Dispersion;Electromagnetic waveguides;Loading;Delays;Antennas","","25","","51","IEEE","7 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article proposes seven parameters to determine the best fit subreflector (BFS): five rigid parameters (three translation and two rotation parameters) and two parameters related to the change of the subreflector shape. These seven homology parameters are calculated by the least square method (LSM). The subreflector of the QiTai radio telescope (QTT) is used in two examples. The first example shows that the proposed method can effectively calculate the BFS surface and obtain the accuracy that has eliminated the harmless error of the distorted subreflector. In the second example, the accuracy without harmless error is used in the classical design so that the homologous design of the subreflector structure is realized.

However, state-of-the-art magnetoactuated approaches rely on soft-magnetic materials that suffer from stress failure, exhibit limited degrees of freedom, and do not allow programmable polarity deformations. Our work overcomes these challenges. By embedding NdFeB particles in soft silicone and by further coating e-thread antennas with the resulting flexible material, novel prototypes are brought forward that allow programmable polarity, stable magnetic properties, untethered actuation, response speed that could not be captured with high-speed camera (60 frames/s), reversible deformation, light weight, and extreme mechanical/thermal tolerance. In this article, we introduce the operating principle of this new class of antennas, optimize their fabrication, and validate them numerically and experimentally. As a proof-of-concept, validation is carried out for an accordion-based monopole, tunable from 680 to 835 MHz when actuated by a remote magnet. In future, this approach can be leveraged toward diverse reconfigurable antennas in consumer and defense applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2988937","King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9079612","Conductive threads;flexible antennas;magnetic substrate;reconfigurable antennas;textile antennas","Antennas;Magnetomechanical effects;Soft magnetic materials;Magnetic moments;Magnetic fields;Magnetic properties;Magnetic domains","","10","","35","IEEE","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the two thin and lightweight DDLs can transform the quasi-Gaussian beam with spherical phase front from the feed horn into a well-collimated and confined pseudo-Bessel beam. Second, we demonstrate that simultaneous in-plane rotation of the two DLLs in the same and opposite directions can steer the generated Bessel beam in the azimuth and elevation, respectively.

Thus, a wideband and low-profile unidirectional loop-dipole antenna with planar structure that is capable of scanning in the azimuth plane is proposed. The antenna consists of a one-wavelength loop, a modified half-wavelength bow-tie dipole, and two parasitic directors to achieve wide operating bandwidth and high front-to-back ratio (FBR). The dipole antenna is directly fed using coaxial cable, whereas the loop is excited using offset proximity coupling. The unidirectional radiation pattern is achieved by quasi-Yagi mode at lower frequencies and a combination of loop and dipole modes at higher frequencies. The parasitic directors are utilized to alter the current distribution on the loop and, thus, enable beam switching in different directions. To verify the proposed concept, two p-i-n diodes are used to change the current nodes on the loop and, hence, switch the radiation pattern from 200 to 00 and +200 in the azimuth plane. The proposed antenna, which has the compact size of 0.32λ0 × 0.2λ0 × 0.004λ0 (where λ0 is wavelength at the lowest operating frequency), has a wide fractional bandwidth of 55% at 0.8-1.4 GHz, which is suitable for pleural effusion detection.

Both the stored energies and the radiated power, required to evaluate Q-factor, are coordinate-independent and expressed in a similar manner to the periodic electric field integral equation and can thus be rapidly calculated. Numerical investigations, performed for several antenna arrays, indicate fine agreement, accurate enough to be predictive, between the proposed Q-factor and the tuned fractional bandwidth, when the arrays are not too wideband (i.e., when Q ≥ 5).

For the array element, to obtain wide-angle radiation and wideband characteristic, parallel slots with unequal lengths are deliberately etched on a low-profile substrate integrated cavity (SIC). The mutual impedance between two arbitrary elements is remarkably controlled and compensated by canceling the major coupling effect, which is realized by etching symmetrical slots and loading periodical loops within each element.

A major innovation is the seamless integration of several phase inverters into an electrically long TE0.5,0 mode open waveguide. The resulting open structure radiates as a collinear series of MD sections. The inverters facilitate the realization of in-phase electric fields along its entire length and, hence, phase coherence between all of these MDs. Each phase inverter is realized as a combination of a meandering slot on one metallic surface of the waveguide and several shorting vias surrounding it. Two such multistaged (six- and eight-element) collinear OTIP MD arrays were designed and optimized. Prototypes of both were fabricated with standard, low-cost PCB manufacturing technology. The volume of the six-element (eight-element) OTIP array is only 0.07 × 0.22 × 3.3 λ03 (0.07 × 0.22 × 4.3 λ03); it achieves a measured 8.2 dBi (10.4 dBi) peak realized gain (RG).

In this method, by introducing the concepts of normalized temporal angular frequency and spatial angular frequency, the broadband pattern is treated as a spatiotemporal spectral distribution. The relationship between the FIR coefficient distribution and the spatiotemporal spectral distribution can be built as an STFT, and consequently the 2-D fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) and inverse 2D-FFT (2D-IFFT) can be utilized to efficiently accomplish the transformation between the FIR coefficient distribution and the spatiotemporal spectral distribution. Thus, the proposed synthesis method starts from an initial spatiotemporal spectral distribution and then adopt an iterative modification-and-transformation strategy to successively update the obtained spatiotemporal spectral distribution and the corresponding FIR coefficients. Two kinds of pattern modification techniques including the mainlobe FI modification and broadband sidelobe control are adopted in each iteration. Several examples for synthesizing different FI patterns are conducted. Synthesis results show that the proposed method can obtain much better FI pattern performance in terms of both mainlobe FI property and sidelobe control than the original FT method whilst costing less CPU time than the convex optimization method especially for the case of large FI arrays.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2986696","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61871338); University of Technology Sydney; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066932","2-D fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT);Finiteimpulse-response (FIR) filter;frequency invariant (FI) beam pattern;spatiotemporal Fourier transform (STFT)","Broadband communication;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Broadband antennas;Finite impulse response filters;Iterative methods;Fourier transforms;Finite wordlength effects","","24","","23","IEEE","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In dual-band shared-aperture antenna arrays that operate in higher and lower frequency bands, feeding coaxial cables of the higher band antenna array will inevitably introduce electromagnetic coupling in the lower band antenna arrays. The cross-band coupling will further lead to radiation pattern distortion, gain decrease, and impedance mismatching in the lower band antennas. Instead of using conventional straight coaxial cable feedings, this article proposes to decouple the unwanted cross-band coupling with a novel helical torsion coaxial cable design. The helical torsion feeding (HTF) coaxial cables are investigated from equivalent circuit analysis and full-wave simulation. The analysis results demonstrate that the HTF coaxial cable possesses open-circuit characteristic in the operation band of the lower band antenna. Through this design, the cross-band coupling is effectively suppressed at 0.69 GHz. The effectiveness of the approach is then demonstrated in a dual-band shared-aperture antenna array.

Thus, all the energy carried by the SW is used for launching the single inhomogeneous plane wave into space without accumulation of reactive energy in the higher-order modes.

The water-based FSR consists of a bandpass frequency selective surface (FSS) and a 3-D-printed container. The water substrate is filled into the sealed space constructed by the above two structures. Numerical results show that the FSR can achieve absorption with high absorptivity from 8.3 to 15.2 GHz and can obtain a transmission band of 5.2-7.0 GHz. The minimum insertion loss of the transmission band reaches 0.72 dB at 6.14 GHz.

This article proposes a novel approach to adaptive transitions between different dipole moments to allow for consistent excitation of Fano and electric quadrupole resonances that are extremely sensitive to geometric errors. The proposed geometry of each metamolecule consists of four strips printed on a thin dielectric film with four gaps between the strips, and the geometric error is described as structural deformation by adjusting the strip lengths and gap sizes in the vertical direction. In each deformed state, current and magnetic-field distributions are analyzed to interpret operating principles, and multipole moments are calculated based on the multipole expansion using the current distributions. The results demonstrate that the consistent excitation of the electric quadrupole moment is enabled based on a simultaneous transition between toroidal and electric dipole moments, and the Fano resonance is consistently excited by the magnetic-to-electric dipole moment transition. For verification, original and deformed metasurfaces are fabricated, and their transmission and reflection coefficients are measured in a semianechoic chamber to experimentally validate the proposed dipole moment transitions. The results confirm that the proposed approach has great potential to bring advances in recent sensing and energy harvesting applications where an extremely high Q-factor is essential.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2983770","New Faculty General Research Fund of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)(grant numbers:1.180044.01); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:NRF-2018R1C1B5041286); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9055388","Dark mode;energy harvesting;high quality (Q) factor;high Q resonance;metasurface;microwave sensing;subradiative resonance","Magnetic moments;Magnetic resonance;Toroidal magnetic fields;Strips;Geometry;Current distribution;Q-factor","","5","","31","IEEE","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Without the use of any metallic unit, the dielectric element shows a high transmission magnitude of up to 0.95 and a nearly full phase-control coverage of about 330°. Moreover, the element is polarization-sensitive, capable of providing different phase gradients for the orthogonally polarized incident waves. As a result, two spatially separated foci can be obtained for the orthogonal polarizations through the focusing MS, and the focal positions can be independently controlled by tuning the lengths of the two orthogonal arms of the cross-shaped dielectric elements. For verification, a prototype of the dielectric focusing MS is fabricated and measured. A separation of more than two wavelengths between the two polarization-dependent foci is obtained.

Previously, most of the investigations on the Brewster effect are limited for the homogeneous isotropic medium and the condition is sensitive to the polarization states. Here, it is predicted both theoretically and numerically that an arbitrarily polarized electromagnetic wave can perfectly refract through an anisotropic plate. In particular, both TE- and TM-polarized incident waves can have an identical Brewster angle with total transmission at either normal or oblique incidence by adjusting the material anisotropy. As a proof of concept, we employ this unified theory into the design of a 2-D reflectionless lens with a simplified restriction condition. It is demonstrated that perfect wavefront shaping with no fundamental limits on its efficiency is obtained with the proposed topology. To illustrate practically the concept of Brewster lens, a three-layer cascaded lens is fabricated and measured with a thickness of 0.1λ and an aperture efficiency of 94.3%.

Perfect electric scatterers in homogeneous media are considered. Even though the frequency behavior can be complicated, the electromagnetic scattering does not arbitrarily change in the frequency band of interest. Thus, instead of using computationally inefficient, large-dimension numerical approximation scenarios, such as the method of moments, to solve for integral equations in the band of interest, a low-dimension reduced-basis space is identified to approximate the smooth evolution of the electromagnetic scattering itself as frequency changes. As a result, the frequency-parameter scattering problem is solved within a reduced-order model approach. The electric field integral equation formulation is addressed and properly selected electric currents are considered to span the reduced-basis space in the frequency band of interest. The involved frequency dependence in the integral equation due to the wave propagation phenomena described in the free-space Green's function has traditionally limited the applicability of reduced-basis approximations for fast frequency sweep in integral equation methods in electromagnetics. In this article, we focus on this difficulty and propose a physics-based approach where the frequency-parameter dependence shows an affine behavior in the integral equation, without relying on rather complicated interpolation schemes. As a result, a fast frequency sweep for integral equation problems in electromagnetics is proposed. Finally, real-life applications will illustrate the capabilities of this methodology.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2992882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091941","Computer-aided engineering;electromagnetic scattering;error analysis;Galerkin method;integral equations;method of moments (MoM);reduced-basis methods (RBMs);reduced-order systems","Integral equations;Method of moments;Electromagnetic scattering;Current;Reduced order systems;Mathematical model","","13","","36","IEEE","13 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second image-enhancing module (IEM) is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is used to refine further the images from the NMM to obtain high-accuracy pixel-based model parameter distribution in the inversion domain. Compared with the traditional approximate methods such as backpropagation, the NMM-IEM machine learning can produce the preliminary image with a much higher accuracy but the unknown weight matrices of the ELM are only solved once during training. Hence, the IEM connected to the NMM has a simple architecture and can be trained at a rather low cost.

The points, where exact ray paths intersect with the surface, are obtained according to the Fermat principle of least time. If the interaction surface is aligned with diffraction edges, the corresponding critical points of the second kind can also be retrieved and complicated diffraction treatments by shooting diffracted rays on Keller cones can be avoided. Thus, a substantial reduction in the number of rays can be achieved.

Taking into account the influence of this anisotropy on the signal along the direction of propagation at an angle y, to the horizon, can be useful in modeling and interpreting the results of measurements. Usually when modeling the propagation of an electromagnetic signal in the anisotropic turbulent atmosphere, the effective anisotropic parameter η is introduced. In the latter case, the dependence of the wave vector is given by the expression k = √ηk2ρ+kz2, where kz is a vertical component of k, and kρ is horizontal. However, the spectral index of the structural function, α, remains constant and independent of y. Here, we consider the structural function of atmospheric turbulence with dependence on the propagation angle y. The existing experimental data show that the spectral index α is a function of height and y. The dependence of the α parameter on y is introduced, and it is determined from the experimental measurements of atmospheric turbulent spectra.

The proposed solution uses a low-profile array of antenna elements (sensors) mounted on a finite conducting ground. A compact-size sensor array of six electrically small dual-band omnidirectional spiral antenna elements was designed as a front end of a tracker to operate in the 402 and 837 MHz spectrum bands. For the lower band, a three-element superposition method is applied to support estimation of the angle of arrival (AOA), whereas all six sensors are employed for the higher band. A low complexity and accurate AOA determination algorithm is proposed, the projection vector (PV), and this is combined with the array mentioned. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is integrated with the PV technique to increase the estimation resolution. The system was found to be suitable for installation on the roof of vehicles to localize the position of assets.

This is feasible when the antenna and the tag are stationary. However, in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RFID localization, the relative motion of the reader antenna and tag changes the antenna phase center and tag orientation, thus resulting in a continuous change of the initial phase. This change, which will cause the nonideal phase offset (NPO) and, thus, have an adverse effect on positioning, has been neglected in most previous SAR RFID studies. In this article, we investigate the antenna phase uncertainty and the tag orientation-dependent phase offset and analyze their influence on localization accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the initial phase is regarded as a variable in SAR RFID localization. In addition, a novel motion model-based localization (MoLoc) method is proposed, which exploits the relative motion model and visualizes the influence of NPO more intuitively. Compared with the conventional grid-matching methods, MoLoc shows higher accuracy and much lower computation time. Both the influence of NPO and the performance of MoLoc are verified by experiments implemented in real scenario. The experiments also evaluate the influence of NPO on the grid-matching method. The experimental results show that NPO has a significant impact on the accuracy of SAR-based localization methods.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2982448","National Key Research and Development Project of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102405); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972279,61671318); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9052482","Antenna phase center;localization;motion model-based localization (MoLoc);phase-based;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);ultrahigh-frequency radio frequency identification (UHF RFID)","Radiofrequency identification;Synthetic aperture radar;Antenna measurements;Antenna arrays;Phase measurement;Dipole antennas","","41","","36","IEEE","1 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Six-Component Vector Sensor Comprising Electrically Long Dipoles and Large Loops— To Simultaneously Estimate Incident Sources’ Directions-of-Arrival and Polarizations","S. Khan; K. T.

The former triplet aims to directly measure the 3 × 1 electric-field vector e, whereas the latter triplet aims to directly measure the 3 × 1 magnetic-field vector h. Their vector cross product e × h would yield the incident source's Poynting vector, which specifies the incident wavefield's propagation direction. In reality, all these are only an idealization. Instead, a real-world dipole triad's measurement could equal the incident e, only if the dipoles were electrically short (i.e., with an electrical length of (L/λ) <; 0.1). Likewise, a practical loop triad's measurement could equal the incident h, only if the loops were electrically small (i.e., with an electrical circumference of 2π(R/λ) <; 0.1). However, such short dipoles and small loops would be electromagnetically inefficient receivers. For a practical dipole that is electrically long, its measurement equals not the incident wavefield's e but a vector dot product between: 1) the incident wave's e and 2) that dipole antenna's “effective length” vector (which depends on that dipole's (L/λ) and orientation). An analogous complexity exists for a practical loop that is electrically large. For such practical dipoles and loops, the aforementioned vector-cross-product would fail to yield the Poynting vector, hence it would inaccurately estimate the direction-of-arrival. Instead, this article will advance a new closed-form algorithm to simultaneously estimate an incident source's direction-ofarrival and polarization, despite the practical dipoles'/ loops' mathematically complicated gain/phase responses as described earlier, but without any prior knowledge of the dipoles' electric length (L/λ) nor the loops' electric radius (R/λ).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2988980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9079610","Antenna arrays;array signal processing;direction of arrival estimation;parameter estimation;polarization;polarization estimation;radio direction finding;signal processing antennas","Dipole antennas;Antenna arrays;Antenna measurements;Electric variables measurement;Estimation;Manifolds;Directive antennas","","14","","45","IEEE","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reducing the number of samples along one of the spherical coordinates allows to decrease the number of positioner steps. Therefore, the savings in the number of samples are almost directly translated into measurement time savings. Under-sampling usually leads to aliasing; however, it can be controlled by exploiting the properties of the spherical wave expansion. The axial symmetry of conventional antennas leads to narrow azimuthal spectra, where the influence of this aliasing is small. By designing an estimator of the error introduced by the aliasing, the required number of φ samples for a given accuracy can be determined, without any a priori knowledge about the antenna under test. This allows the application of this technique for any kind of antenna regardless of its level of axial symmetry, obtaining different values of measurement time savings depending on the level of symmetry. Several examples using the numerical and measured data are presented, showing significant reductions in the measured samples for different antennas. In addition, the algorithm is successfully tested against antennas with poor axial symmetry to demonstrate its robustness.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2986718","Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (Programa Propio); Spanish Government, Ministry of Economy, National Program of Research, Development and Innovation through the Project FUTURE-RADIO “Radio Systems and Technologies for High Capacity Terrestrial and Satellite Communications in an Hyperconnected World”(grant numbers:TEC2017-85529-C3-1-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9067036","Aliasing;antenna measurements;near-field to far-field transformation;spherical wave expansion (SWE);under-sampling","Antenna measurements;Time measurement;Harmonic analysis;Antenna radiation patterns;Reflector antennas;Measurement uncertainty","","15","","21","IEEE","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, the TM00 and TM10 modes of such an antenna are theoretically studied based on the transmission-line model. It is revealed that the lower resonant frequency of the TM00 mode could be effectively reallocated by properly introducing the inductance at its center. Meanwhile, the upper resonant frequency of TM10 mode remains unaffected during this process. This theoretical analysis provides a physical insight into its working mechanism. Then, a set of shorting pins is symmetrically loaded in the center of the patch radiator to make use of their equivalent inductance for flexible control of its operating frequency. After parametric analysis is extensively executed, a unified design procedure is summarized. With these arrangements, a wide frequency ratio of two operating bands could be flexibly realized in a range from 1.38 to 3.36. Finally, two DBDM antennas with the same patch contour but distinct frequency ratio, i.e., 1.38 and 3.36, are designed, fabricated, and tested. The simulated and measured results are found in good agreement with each other, thereby certifying the validity of the proposed method.

In order to obtain the minimum number of molds satisfying the given electronic performance index, the electronic performance-oriented mold sharing design is suggested, in which the effective surface accuracy is used to evaluate electrical performance. The smaller the combined effective root-mean-square (rms) error value introduced after sharing the mold, the more preferential these rings should share the mold to reduce the number of molds.

In this method, only two points along the thin dipole antenna are properly found and loaded by two capacitors, lumped or distributed. At these two loading points, there are current nulls of the third mode of the dipole. With two capacitive loadings, an obvious upshifting of the first mode’s resonant frequency is observed but with little effects on the third mode. By compressing the first and third modes, an enhancement of the antenna bandwidth is achieved. In addition, a parallel line is used as a transformer for impedance matching. A prototype of the design has been fabricated and tested. The measured results agree well with the simulated ones. In the thin structure of  $1.01\times 0.09\,\,\lambda _{0}$  ( $\lambda _{0}$  is the free space wavelength at the center frequency), a wide bandwidth from 1.88 to 3.18 GHz (51.4%) is achieved, performing an omnidirectional radiation pattern with gain of 2.0–4.0 dBi in azimuthal plane.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2972642","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Manipulate(grant numbers:4182029); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program(grant numbers:2019Z08QCX16); Youth Top Program of Beijing Outstanding Talent Funding Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999787","Broadband antennas;capacitive loading;dipole antennas;multimode resonance","Dipole antennas;Loading;Bandwidth;Capacitors;Antenna measurements;Resonant frequency;Antenna radiation patterns","","39","","32","IEEE","14 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, an array antenna formed by 48 rings of slots is proposed following the design rules of traveling-wave arrays. Every ring is properly designed to achieve a uniform power distribution and consequently maximum directivity for the array antenna performance.
