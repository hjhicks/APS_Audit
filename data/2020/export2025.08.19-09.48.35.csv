However, large data sets restrict the popularization of the machine learning methods when the data acquisition is nontrivial. To solve this problem, a novel machine learning method is proposed in this article based on the modified K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, which can extract more features from the data sets through the advanced workflow and simulation techniques. In the applications presented here, our method is 5-30 times faster than the traditional machine learning methods such as the artificial neural network (ANN) and Bayesian optimization by reducing the required size of the data sets. The proposed method is then employed to optimize the antenna parameters, while an additional branch is built to run the simulation tools (e.g., HFSS) and update the data set during the training process instead of constructing the data set beforehand. The validity and efficiency of this proposed method are confirmed by four different antenna examples and other machine learning and gradient-based algorithms. In summary, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory optimal antenna design at little cost.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3001743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119820","Antenna optimization;K-nearest neighbor (KNN);machine learning","Training;Antennas;Machine learning;Data models;Measurement;Kernel;Testing","","109","","21","IEEE","17 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventionally, they increase the gain in the boresight direction only.

The side lenses are tilted to align with the maximum steering angle and cascaded to increase the focusing gain. The inner lenses increase the gain by 2.45 dB at boresight, and by 3.19 dB at the maximum steering angle. When the side lenses are repositioned, the simulated focusing gain increases to 4.69 dB. Asymmetric amplitude distributions are proposed to prevent the main lobe from splitting. An eight-element seven-lens prototype operating at 28 GHz achieved a gain from 12.96 to 15.35 dBi with a bandwidth of at least 1.3 GHz for all measured beam directions. The maximum measured azimuthal beamwidth was 27°. A design procedure and a theoretical analysis of diffraction through the lenses are provided.

Due to the symmetry of the coupler, the proposed rectenna can work at multipolarization modes, i.e., the circular polarization (CP) for the single-port operation and the linear polarization (LP) for the dual-port operation. Besides, a medium-power rectifying circuit is proposed, where its maximum radio frequency (RF) to direct current (dc) power conversion efficiencies is 53.6% (simulated) and 51.1% (experimental) at the input power of 0 and 0.5 dBm, respectively. By using the coupler, the conversion efficiency and impedance matching of the rectenna can be significantly improved. In addition, the power division between the two ports is considered at different modes.

Further, by appropriate placement of metallic via holes, a pair of back-to-back half-modes realizes generating two symmetrical side beams in E-plane with an enhanced gain over 40-52 GHz. Mode switching is performed electronically by incorporating p-i-n diodes and proper biasing network.

The proposed UCs can be employed to construct an RA antenna with 2-D beam-steerable abilities. For demonstration, the RA antennas with six different beam directions are presented as examples, by simply adjusting the rotations of the UCs. The impedance matches of the RA antenna are all below -10 dB from 22 to 33 GHz, and the measured radiation patterns of the RA antenna are all highly consistent with the simulated counterparts for the six different beam direction scenarios. A 1.5 dB gain drop bandwidth of approximately 20% from 24.7 to 30 GHz and a peak realized gain of 18.9 dBi at 26 GHz are experimentally obtained for the RA antenna with radiation patterns at broadside.

The improvement in the XPD is experimentally demonstrated by far-field measurement. When the beams scan to 30° off the boresight, the measured XPDs are 28 dB at the center frequency and higher than 25 dB over the operation bandwidth, which confirms that the cross-polarized radiation in the 2-D multibeam antenna array is suppressed by using the differential-feeding technique.

The antenna array simply consists of a microstrip line and a series of short stubs that are periodically introduced on one edge of the microstrip line, at an interval of about one guide wavelength. Owing to the perturbation of the additional stubs, the original symmetrical E-field distributions on the two opposite edges of the microstrip line become asymmetrical, and the intensities of the equivalent magnetic currents are unequal and unable to cancel each other out as in a pure microstrip line. As a result, the stub-loaded microstrip line can radiate effectively, producing broadside radiation patterns. The introduction of stubs can also generate an extra resonant mode, which combines with the resonant mode of the microstrip line, yielding a wide bandwidth of over 20%. In addition, the microstrip array is simply fed by a coaxial probe, without involving any complex feeding network. Therefore, the array configuration is very simple and compact. For demonstration, a $1 \times 4\,\,1$ -D microstrip linear array operating at 27 GHz is fabricated and tested. The measured results show that the array has an impedance bandwidth of 21.40%, an average realized gain of 12.18 dBi, and a first sidelobe level (FSLL) of about -13 dB. Moreover, the FSLL can be decreased to -28.4 dB by tapering the width of the microstrip line. Finally, the design is extended to realize a $4 \times 4\,\,2$ -D microstrip planar array.

It is also demonstrated that discrete radiating structures, like antenna arrays, are not capable of exciting pure (uncorrupted) OAM modes. The corruption is caused by an infinite number of higher-order modes, which is a direct consequence of the sampling theory. However, the impact of higher-order modes decays as the number of array elements increases. This leads to the fact that pure OAM modes can only be generated in the (continuous) limit of an infinite number of array elements, and proposes using transmitting and receiving arrays with considerably different number of elements for increasing the measurement accuracy of the intended fundamental modes. Closed-form expressions for the radiation patterns as well as graphical simulations justify the above-mentioned assertions. The array interelement coupling is finally considered, which shows some practical challenges related to the matching of multiple OAM modes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2993311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9093988","Antenna feeds;antenna radiation patterns;beam steering;butler matrices;mutual coupling;phased arrays;radio propagation","Antenna radiation patterns;Beam steering;Couplings;Array signal processing;Phased arrays;Channel capacity","","10","","20","IEEE","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each FSS element is formed by introducing parallel-coupled stepped-impedance slotline resonators (SISRs) on a printed circuit board (PCB). By periodically printing the FSS elements in long PCB pieces and then stacking them together with a certain distance, the incident spatial waves in free space can be converted into guided waves propagating along the slotline resonators of our proposed FSS and can be reconverted from guided waves into spatial waves. Therefore, the slotline resonators are designed to manipulate the incident spatial waves by controlling the filtering response of the guided waves within the FSS. An equivalent transmission-line (TL) model is then established to explain the manipulation mechanism. In order to systematically synthesize the filtering response, the transfer function of the equivalent TL model is mapped to the generalized Chebyshev equal-ripple response. The closed-form equations are derived, where all of the electrical and physical parameters are determined by the design specifications of in-band equal-ripple return loss (RL) and fractional bandwidth (FBW). To verify the theoretically predicted performances, three examples with different RLs (20, 30, and 10 dB) and FBWs (90%, 60%, and 120%) are designed, fabricated, and measured, respectively.

To this end, the ideal reflection and transmission properties of the metasurface unit cell are firstly revealed. And then an anisotropic unit cell composed of multilayered metallic patterns is designed to obtain the desired reflection and transmission properties. The bottom layer is composed of the typical patch-grid-patch bandpass frequency selective surface, which allows for high transmission in the transparent window and also behaves as a metallic-like reflection sheet in the RCS reduction band. Two metasurfaces, with checkerboard and aperiodic configurations, respectively, were designed, fabricated, and measured, as a proof-of-concept demonstration.

The periodic surface is initially simulated with an arbitrary azimuthal incidence angle, and its surface impedance matrix is derived. The impedance matrix is subsequently rotated by an angle $\varphi ^{rot}$ on the crystal axes $\chi _{1}$ and $\chi _{2}$ , thus nullifying its extra diagonal terms. The rotation angle $\varphi ^{rot}$ is derived according to the spectral theorem by using the terms of the matrix initially extracted. The diagonal terms of the rotated matrix, that is, the impedances $Z_{\chi _{1}}$ and $Z_{\chi _{2}}$ , are finally matched with the simple LC networks. The circuit model representation of the anisotropic element can be used to analyze the anisotropic FSSs rotated by a generic azimuth angle. The methodology provides a compact description of the generic FSS elements with only five parameters: the lumped parameters of the LC network $L_{\chi _{1}}$ , $C_{\chi _{1}}$ , $L_{\chi _{2}}$ , $C_{\chi _{2}}$ and the rotation angle $\varphi ^{rot}$ .

Different from the traditional SIE-DDM, where the interactions between subdomains are accounted for using global radiation coupling, LCMT-DDM uses a local coupling scheme. The original multilayered object is decomposed into several independent domains, i.e., the exterior region (free space) and many homogeneous interior regions (dielectrics). The boundaries of subdomains are all touching faces, where only the Robin transmission conditions (RTCs) are enforced to ensure the field continuity. Hence, each subdomain only couples with its neighboring regions, which makes the DDM system a highly sparse matrix, especially when the number of subdomains is large. In each subdomain, the electric-field integral equation (EFIE) and the magnetic-field integral equation (MFIE) for dielectrics are used as the governing equations. By imposing RTCs, well-conditioned equations are formed in each subdomain without invoking the combined-field integral equation (CFIE), which usually causes accuracy issues in dielectric modeling. Since the subdomain matrices are diagonally dominant, the flexible generalized minimal residual (FGMRES) technique is used to accelerate the iterative solution of the whole DDM system.

Accurate understanding and modeling of the ultrawideband propagation channel with large-scale array configuration is essential. In this contribution, a realistic spherical-propagation signal model considering the spatial nonstationarity of path gain across the array elements is proposed. A novel trajectory-aided maximum-likelihood (TAMax) algorithm is proposed to extract propagation parameters from the measured data, since the existing high-resolution propagation parameter estimation algorithms are not applicable due to either prohibitively high computation loads or assumption violations. In the proposed TAMax algorithm, the high-dimensional maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) problem is first decomposed into a subproblem where delays and amplitudes of multipath components (MPCs) are estimated at individual array elements. A novel transform is then proposed to identify multiple MPC trajectories in the delay-element domain. With interference cancellation and fast initialization obtained in the proposed transform, spherical propagation parameters are finally acquired via joint MLE with significantly decreased searching spaces.

The theory utilizes discrete phase-space sets of beam waves, which constitute overcomplete frames everywhere in the propagation domain, and thus can be considered as a local alternative to the conventional plane-wave or Green's function integrals used in conventional diffraction tomography. Specifically, we formulate two inversion schemes, a multi-frequency domain scheme, and a time domain scheme. The former utilizes isodiffracting Gaussian beams, while the latter utilizes isodiffracting pulsed beams. Both schemes consist of two phases: In the preprocessing phase, the scattering data are expanded as a sum of beams whose amplitudes, referred to as the “beam-domain data,” are extracted from the data using local beam-based transforms. In the imaging phase, the beam data are backpropagated and used for local reconstruction. In this Part I we discuss the preprocessing phase. We define the beam-based transforms, and then use the Born approximation to establish a cogent physical interpretation of the beam-domain data. Specifically, we show that these data are related to the local Radon transform of the medium, which is interpreted physically as a local Snell's law. This relation will be used in Part II to reconstruct the medium.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2992806","Israeli Science Foundation (ISF)(grant numbers:412/15,1111/19); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091932","Beam summation methods;diffraction tomography (DT);inverse scattering","Tomography;Scattering;Acoustic beams;Transforms;Inverse problems;Time-domain analysis;Frequency measurement","","8","","39","IEEE","13 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For discriminating between different components, a filter exhibits a frequency-selective response that, however, is not able to distinguish between different signals whose spectrum falls within the passband of the filter itself. In this regard, some electromagnetic structures exhibiting, at the same frequency, different responses depending on the waveform of the incoming waves have been recently proposed. In this communication, we extend the aforementioned approach to the case of a standard waveguide filtering module. In particular, by loading a bandpass filtering iris with a proper lumped-element circuit, we design a waveguide component able to distinguish between different pulsed waves, even at the same frequency, depending on their pulsewidth. Moreover, by using this filter for capping an open-ended rectangular waveguide, a radiating element with both frequency- and time-domain selectivity properties is presented. The structures discussed in this communication may pave the way to a new class of microwave systems that, being both frequency selective and time selective, are less sensitive to noise and interferences.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2977761","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(grant numbers:PRIN 2017 Project (protocol number 2017HZJXSZ)); frame of the activities of the research contract CYBER-PHYSICAL ELECTROMAGNETIC VISION: Context-Aware Electromagnetic Sensing and Smart Reaction; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028087","Filtering modules;time-domain response;waveguide components;waveform selectivity","Electromagnetic waveguides;Iris;Microwave filters;Band-pass filters;Time-domain analysis;RLC circuits","","33","","20","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
