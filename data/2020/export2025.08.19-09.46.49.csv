In building a better device or system, we are bound 1) by the properties of the materials available to us and 2) by our understanding of physical phenomena. The physical laws of the universe, immutable as they are, lead us naturally to question whether we may be able to “engineer” raw materials to better allow us to achieve, control, and manipulate natural phenomena for useful purposes. In order to do this, we must first define what we mean by the term “material.” The perception that a material must appear homogeneous to the naked eye (i.e., “a uniform goop, with no discontinuous bits and pieces” [1]), natural though it may be, is flawed: surely, all materials may be considered heterogeneous on some level of scale, but more importantly, this perspective is tied specifically to the electromagnetic response of these materials to wavelengths of light that are visible to the human eye. For example, although a diamond displays familiar macroscopic properties such as color, luster, and dispersion when viewed under visible light, illumination using X-rays results in a diffraction pattern that reveals its crystalline structure. Thus, the macroscopic properties of a material, e.g. polarizabilities, permittivity, permeability, refractive index, intrinsic bulk or surface impedance, and so on, are revealed only under illumination by wavelengths of light much longer than the size of its scatterers (i.e., its atoms and molecules) and their spacing (e.g., the lattice constants of a crystal). Therefore, it would seem that engineering such macroscopic properties of materials would require control of scattering at length scales of fractions—say several hundredths or even just tenths—of a wavelength, a prohibitive task if dealing in the nanometers or Angstroms. Fortunately, the reach of the electromagnetic spectrum permits us to examine the long-wavelength condition at frequencies where such length scales become much more accessible, such as the microwave and terahertz. Advances in nanoscale fabrication have extended this reach even further to infrared and visible light. At such scales, it becomes possible to synthesize scatterers to exhibit electric and magnetic responses that may then, in analogy to their natural counterparts, be homogenized to describe effective macroscopic electromagnetic properties apparent under illumination by correspondingly long wavelengths.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2969732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9023502","","Special issues and sections;Metamaterials;Dielectrics;Metasurfaces;Electromagnetics","","89","","78","IEEE","3 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using this approach, arbitrary plane waves are excited inside a metallic cavity by peripheral sources, and the cavity is engineered to radiate a single or multiple pencil beams through appropriately perforated slots on its top surface. The proposed peripherally excited (PEX) phased array architecture generates pencil beams that are electronically scanned by controlling the amplitudes and phases of the peripheral sources.

At the frequency where the SW wavelength matches the period of the impedance modulation, the -1 indexed (leaky) mode of the Floquet-mode expansion in cylindrical coordinates provides a broadside beam. The mismatch between the SW wavelength and the period of the modulation imposes a limitation on the product bandwidth-gain. Here, we overcome this limitation by exponentially stretching the radial period of the impedance modulation. Doing so, an annular active region is generated on the antenna aperture, which moves from the antenna center to the circular rim as the frequency decreases. This mechanism enables a broadside beam over an extreme large bandwidth. We, therefore, significantly extend the applicability of these antennas, e.g., to requirements of 30±1.5dB gain over 30% bandwidths. Here, an analytical formulation is proposed to treat the active region migration and edge outgoing by a Fresnel-type transition function. This function predicts in closed form the antenna bandwidth and average gain. A more accurate gain versus frequency response is also introduced by an integral formula that accounts for the frequency-dependent amplitude distribution of the aperture fields. The theory is validated by full-wave simulations and by measurements of a prototype realized by subwavelength elliptical patches. The presented results show that these antennas can provide a performance difficult to reach by any other flat antennas based on printed technology.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2940365","European Space Agency(grant numbers:4000113714/15/NL/MH/ats); Région Bretagne(grant numbers:SAD17012); European Regional Development Fund; French Region of Brittany, Ministry of Higher Education and Research, Rennes Métropole and Conseil Départemental 35 through the CPER Project STIC & Ondes; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839707","Circular polarization;impedance boundary conditions;leaky waves (LWs);metasurface (MTS) antenna;surface-wave (SW);broadband antenna","Apertures;Bandwidth;Broadband antennas;Frequency modulation;Impedance","","29","","38","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The MTS synthesis is performed by direct inversion of an electric field integral equation (EFIE) obtained after expanding the unknown equivalent impedance profile into Fourier-Bessel basis functions. Two approaches are explored. The first one assumes a priori a discrete azimuthal symmetry in the impedance profile, so as to constrain the solution to a subspace which automatically provides multiple beams when illuminated with feeds regularly arranged along azimuth. In the second approach, there are not a priori assumptions on the impedance profile, but the systems of equations corresponding to each beam are stacked and solved simultaneously in the least-squares sense. This second approach can also be used to obtain polarization diversity. More importantly, it also enables continuous beam scanning. The latter functionality is achieved through the generation of two embedded patterns in a common azimuthal window with opposite phase slopes, followed by a continuous phasing of the two feed points. Various designs are presented in this article.

Adjacent layers can be stored compressed in a stacked configuration with minimal height, then deployed to an operational arrangement to their full dimensions and capabilities.

Both antennas exhibit attractive properties such as significantly reduced beam-squint, low loss, low sidelobes, high directivity, and simple manufacturing. The beam-squint of conventional LWAs is reduced by refracting the leaked waves in a dispersive lens and the low sidelobe levels are achieved by tapering the leakage rate along the aperture. Since the antennas are implemented in groove gap waveguide technology, the losses are low. The two antennas are different in terms of their asymmetric/symmetric leakage tapering with respect to the broadside direction. Both designs are optimized for low sidelobes, but since symmetry is enforced in one, the resulting performance in terms of sidelobes is suboptimal. However, in the symmetric design, multiple stable beams can be obtained, simultaneously or independently. Twenty percent bandwidth is obtained with less than ±0.5° beam-squint. In this frequency range, the gain is stable at 17 and 15 dBi for the asymmetric and symmetric designs, respectively.

However, when steering the beam, such systems generate undesirable dominant grating lobes, which substantially limit their applications. Optimizing a pair of these metasurfaces to minimize the grating lobes using standard methods is nearly impossible due to their large electrical size and thousands of small features leading to high computational costs. This article addresses this challenge as follows. First, it presents a method to efficiently reduce the strength of “offending” grating lobes by optimizing a supercell using Floquet analysis and multi-objective particle swarm optimization. Second, it investigates the effects of the transmission phase gradient of PGMs on radiation-pattern quality. It is shown that the number of dominant unwanted lobes in a 2-D beam-steering antenna system and their levels can be reduced substantially by increasing the transmission phase gradient of the two PGMs. This knowledge is then extended to 2-D beam-steering systems, where we demonstrate how to substantially reduce all grating lobes to a level below -20 dB for all beam directions, without applying any amplitude tapering to the aperture field. When steering the beam of two meta-steering systems with peak directivities of 30.5 and 31.4 dBi, within a conical volume with an apex angle of 96°, the variation in directivity is 2.4 and 3.2 dB, respectively. We also demonstrate that beam-steering systems with steeper gradient PGMs can steer the beam in a wider range of directions, require less mechanical rotation of metasurfaces to obtain a given scan range, and their beam steering is faster. The gap between the two metasurfaces in a near-field meta-steering system can be reduced to one-eighth of a wavelength with no significant effect on pattern quality.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2955244","Australian Government International Research Training Pathway (IRTP) Scholarship; Australian Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917929","5G;beam-steering;communication-on-the-move (COTM);EBG;high-gain antenna;lens antenna;meta-material;near-field;phase gradient metasurfaces (PGMs);phase transformation;radial line slot array (RLSA);satellite communication (SATCOM);SATCOM;satellite TV;sidelobe;sidelobe level (SLL);satellite-on-the-move (SOTM);transmitarray","Two dimensional displays;Gratings;Beam steering;Satellite antennas;Antenna arrays;Metals","","74","","42","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By changing geometric parameters, the dispersion property of the MA can be engineered, so that the cutoff frequency is shifted freely, as well as the strong absorption band being changed. Thus, if the cutoff frequency of the MA is very close to the upper bound frequency of a patch antenna, the patch antenna will obtain polarization-independent low-RCS property out-ofband or in-band cross-polarized and out-of-band copolarized low-RCS properties by replacing the radiation patch with the modulated MA.

Due to their versatility, Huygens' metasurfaces have been used for numerous applications. One interesting application has been perfect or reflectionless wide-angle refraction. In recent years, it was shown that for perfect refraction, omega-bianisotropy was required in Huygens' metasurfaces. To realize omega-bianisotropic designs, asymmetric unit cells were proposed and demonstrated utilizing stacked-layer unit cells. However, an omega-bianisotropic wire-loop unit cell for modulated Huygens' metasurfaces has yet to be demonstrated.

Different from the conventional dielectric lens or single-layered transmitting metasurface, the proposed folded reflective structure achieves the required cubic phase using a quartz-based reflective metasurface with reduced volume and increased efficiency. A quasi-I-shaped unit cell is proposed for the metasurface to manipulate the incident THz wave by efficiently converting the initial illumination to its cross polarization and simultaneously adjusting its phase with a range of 2π.

In comparison with the classical architectures of wireless communication systems, the TDCM has advantages for simple architecture, easy manufacture, and low cost. However, the wireless communication systems based on the TDCM are still limited by low conversion efficiency, spectrum pollution, and hard to implement high-order modulation schemes. To solve these limitations, we propose a new route to achieve multi-modulation schemes in wireless communications by regulating the reflection phases of the TDCM in a nonlinear way. By carefully designing the regulation voltages applied to the diodes on TDCM, arbitrary constellation diagrams are successfully synthesized. The novel systems can implement various modulation schemes such as quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 8PSK, and 16QAM with good communication quality, high stability, and free scheme switching.

We rigorously characterize the electro-optical frequency conversion performance of the metasurface. We then exploit the dispersionless angle-independent phase discontinuities on the wavefront of higher order frequency harmonics to achieve dynamic multi-wavelength multi-beam scanning across S, C, and L telecommunication bands via pixelated control over the modulation phase delay. It is established that such time-modulated metasurfaces can be utilized as reflectarray antennas for active multicasting as well as wavelength and angle multiplexing, thus improving optical communication capacity by providing multiple access and integrating several communication channels into a single antenna platform.

Periodically, time-modulated structures which are usually considered enable wave control over narrowband signals. However, for ultrawideband short-pulse signals, time variation in the form of temporal discontinuities is required. Such a setup has recently been proposed as a means to overcome the Bode-Fano bound on impedance matching. While hard (abrupt) temporal discontinuities are relatively simple to analyze by employing continuity of magnetic flux and electric charge, soft (gradual) temporal switching of the guiding structure parameters is more challenging. This article explores the case of a short-pulse dynamics in a 1-D, metamaterial transmission line (TL), medium with general smooth time variation of its parameters. In this time-varying TL, wave-field solutions are obtained by a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approach which is more common in the context of gradual spatial variations. Using this methodology, a leading order transmitted and reflected waves due to time variation are derived, followed by a discussion of the energy balance in such switched media. A canonical example of capacitor discharge into a long time-varied TL is given. These results may be used as analysis/synthesis tools for time-varying wave devices in electromagnetics and acoustics.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2967302","Israel Science Foundation(grant numbers:545/15); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8966563","Bode–Fano bound;temporal-discontinuity;time-varying medium;transmission-lines (TLs);Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approach","Switches;Media;Impedance;Propagation;Soft switching;Power transmission lines;Impedance matching","","24","","67","IEEE","22 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, physical bounds have been recently derived, based on the Bode-Fano theory of broadband impedance matching, that quantify the inherent difficulty in broadening the bandwidth of any linear, causal, and passive cloak. If we relax the passivity restriction, introducing active media into the system, it is then relevant to ask the following questions: 1) Can the Bode-Fano limit on broadband invisibility be surpassed, at least theoretically, and to what extent? 2) Can we guarantee the stability of a broadband active cloak? In this article, we discuss some steps toward answering these general questions. We first offer an intuitive discussion of why a passive cloak cannot be arbitrarily broadband. Then, we use a 1-D example to show, for the first time, that active cloaks have indeed the potential to operate beyond the Bode-Fano bandwidth limit. Finally, we design a simple 3-D active cloak that exhibits a much broader bandwidth than passive scattering-cancellation cloaks. All the designed active cloaks are stable, and we discuss some relevant conditions to ensure stability.

It is based on two orthogonally polarized small antennas connected via a negative impedance converter (NIC). An NIC converts the admittance of the first antenna into a negative admittance, canceling the admittance of the second antenna within a theoretically infinite bandwidth. This system behaves as a special kind of a nearly perfectly matched small active antenna that supports oscillations at every frequency within NIC's operating bandwidth. Frequency tuning is achieved either by inclusion of a resonant circuit or by injection locking from an external source.

The proposed approach can be scaled in both power and frequency. The concept makes use of the k = 0 mode in a periodic resonant surface to excite a series of phase-locked individual sources on the surface. The phase-locked sources create an overall coherent mode in the far-field toward the desired direction. The proposed idea is inspired by spark-gap transmitters, pulsed ring-down sources, and antenna arrays to provide a novel and highly scalable electromagnetic source.

Unlike conventional continuous metamaterials, for which spatial dispersion originates mostly (but not exclusively) from the nonlocality of their inclusions, they exhibit large spatially nonlocal effects that emerge solely at the array level because of the periodic structuration of simple spatially local scatterers, often allowing for an intrinsically subwavelength granularity. Herein, we demonstrate the unique relevance of metamaterial crystals to induce nonreciprocal electromagnetic propagation at deep subwavelength scales. This is obtained by combining the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, using an externally biased magnetic material, with appropriate spatial-dispersion engineering, via subwavelength structural modification of the metamaterial crystal. Interestingly, the material unit cell can be scaled down without affecting this functionality, leading to the exciting possibility of largely enhanced wave-matter interaction at deep subwavelength scales. Altogether, our proposal provides an interesting route for transposing the rich physics of nonreciprocal systems down to the subwavelength scale.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2925927","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F??rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(grant numbers:172487); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758448","Metamaterials;nonreciprocity;parity-time symmetry;subwavelength wave manipulation","Dispersion;Metamaterials;Magnetic materials;Crystals;Scattering;Resonators;Photonic band gap","","2","","66","IEEE","9 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is achieved by placing a metasurface atop of a ferrite slab, and judiciously phase matching two radiant and one subradiant meta-waveguide modes in order to enhance the magneto-optical response and to create an accidental Dirac cone in the reciprocal space. By applying an in-plane magnetic field, the reciprocal and nonreciprocal contributions to magneto-optical response can interfere constructively/destructively depending on the propagation direction, thereby shifting the apex of the Dirac cone and creating a one-way propagation bandgap.

Two topological variants of the MTM-EBG are introduced and shown to provide different bandgap sizes, suiting each proposed application. A dual-band Wilkinson power divider, a dual-band quadrature hybrid coupler, and a dual-band impedance transformer are designed with embedded MTM-EBGs, which due to their ability to be realized in an entirely uniplanar form without vias and using a single dielectric layer, allow these devices to be entirely printable as well.

The obtained ABCD matrices for equivalent interfaces capture the non-local effects due to the evanescent transverse magnetic (TM) WM mode and in part due to the propagating transverse electromagnetic (TEM) WM mode. This enables one to characterize the overall response of bounded WM structures by cascading the ABCD matrices of equivalent WM interfaces and WM slabs as transmission lines supporting only the propagating TEM WM mode, resulting in a simple circuit-model formalism for bounded WM structures with arbitrary terminations, including the open-end, patch/slot arrays, and thin metal/ 2-D material, among others. The individual ABCD matrices for equivalent WM interfaces apparently violate the conservation of energy and reciprocity, and therefore the equivalent interfaces apparently behave as non-reciprocal lossy or active systems. However, the overall response of a bounded WM structure is consistent with the lossless property maintaining the conservation of energy and reciprocity. These unusual features are explained by the fact that in the non-local WM, the Poynting vector has an additional correction term that takes into account a “hidden power” due to non-local effects. Results are obtained for various numerical examples demonstrating a rapid and efficient solution for bounded WM structures, including the case of geometrically complex multilayer configurations with arbitrary terminations, subject to the condition that WM interfaces are decoupled by the evanescent TM WM mode below the plasma frequency.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2940370","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(grant numbers:UID/EEA/50008/2019); European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016432); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8889989","ABCD matrix;additional boundary condition (ABC);homogenization theory;metamaterials;spatial dispersion (SD);wire medium (WM)","Transmission line matrix methods;Surface impedance;Wires;Media;Impedance;Metamaterials;Dielectric materials","","1","","73","IEEE","1 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, devices with doubly connected contours, thus including masts with arbitrary sections and lenses with holes/forbidden regions in which the material properties cannot be controlled, can be handled. A set of numerical experiments is presented to assess the features of the proposed method in terms of field-manipulation capabilities and complexity of the lens material in a comparative fashion.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2948771","Project Cloaking Metasurfaces for a New Generation of Intelligent Antenna systems (MANTLES); Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research within the PRIN2017 Program; Project SNATCH; Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Directorate General for Cultural and Economic Promotion and Innovation 2017???2019; Project ???SMARTOUR - Piattaforma Intelligente per il Turismo???(grant numbers:SCN_00166); Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research within the Program ???Smart cities and communities and Social Innovation.???; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8887488","Conformal mapping;field manipulation;material-by-design;Schwarz???Christoffel (SC) mapping;transformation electromagnetics (TE)","Lenses;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Electromagnetics;Shape;Conformal mapping;Antenna theory;Antenna arrays","","4","","32","IEEE","30 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome this limitation, a possible solution consists in etching on a grounded substrate two concentric radiating elements and combining two modes (one for each element) with proper amplitude/phase relations. Although this technique leads, in principle, to an infinite number of possible configurations (i.e., each patch element can support an infinite number of modes), the theoretical and experimental verifications available in the literature are limited to the first two radiating modes (TM11 and TM21) of a circular patch antenna. Recently, we have shown that the design of this circular patch can be effectively performed by exploiting the topological properties of vortex fields and, in particular, by controlling the phase singularity exhibited by the higher order right-handed circularly polarized (RHCP) TM21 mode of the circular patch. Since the number of RHCP higher order modes of a circular patch is infinite, we can in principle deal with an arbitrary number of phase singularity points, whose combined control leads to unprecedented possibilities to shape the radiation pattern of a circular patch. In this article, we present a complete design tool to determine the number and position of phase singularity points arising when combining the RHCP modes of a circular patch antenna and, eventually, manipulate them to synthesize the required radiation pattern. As a realistic application example, we show how the proposed tool can be used to effectively design a single antenna whose radiation pattern can be properly tailored to switch between two different states, i.e., a sector and a saddle shape, widely used in base stations for mobile and satellite communications, respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2944533","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research as a PRIN 2017 Project(grant numbers:2017HZJXSZ.); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8859618","Phase singularities;radiation pattern;saddle pattern;sector antenna;topology;vortices","Antenna radiation patterns;Patch antennas;Shape;Design tools;Switches;Antenna arrays;Periodic structures","","57","","21","IEEE","4 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then provide an intuitive overview of the CI framework and argue that metamaterial antennas are a near ideal platform for implementing such schemes at microwave frequencies. We describe two metamaterial antenna implementations: frequency diverse and electronically reconfigurable. The tradeoffs governing the design and operation of each architecture are examined. We conclude by examining the outlook of metamaterial antennas for microwave imaging and propose various future directions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2968795","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-18-1-0187); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8972939","Antennas;computational imaging (CI);metamaterials;metasurfaces;microwave imaging","Microwave antennas;Microwave imaging;Metamaterials;Hardware;Microwave theory and techniques","","177","","139","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The EIW-TLs are implemented by etching a chain of complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs) in a metallic plate. Such metallic plate acts as the ground plane of the microstrip (access) lines, necessary for feeding each EIW-TL and collecting the transmitted power at the output ports. The working principle of the sensor is mode conversion, caused when the EIW-TLs are asymmetrically loaded. Thus, one of the lines is loaded with the reference (REF) sample, whereas the other one is loaded with the sample under test (SUT). If both samples are identical and the pair of EIW-TLs is fed by a common-mode signal, a pure common-mode signal is collected at the differential output port. Conversely, mode conversion arises when the lines are unequally loaded, due to the different propagation characteristics (particularly the phase velocity) of the lines. Due to the typical dispersion relation of the EIW-TLs, with strong variation in the phase velocity (or phase constant) with frequency, the structure is very sensitive to dielectric constant differences between the REF and SUT samples. Thus, the proposed structure is useful for the accurate measurement of dielectric constants (sensor functionality) and the detection of tiny differences between the REF and SUT samples (comparator functionality).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2938609","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades(grant numbers:TEC2016-75650-R); Generalitat de Catalunya(grant numbers:2017SGR-1159); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) funds; Universidad Politécnica de Madrid(grant numbers:VJIDOCUPM18MGB); Juan de la Cierva Program(grant numbers:IJCI-2017-31339); European Social Fund; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8826584","Complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs);electroinductive waves;microstrip technology;microwave sensors;permittivity sensors","Integrated circuit modeling;Dielectric constant;Sensitivity;Dispersion;Transmission line measurements;Microstrip;Power transmission lines","","81","","71","IEEE","6 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed metasurface measures 6 cm × 6 cm × 0.1 cm, achieving a greatly reduced thickness over a 3-D metamaterial, especially relative to the long wavelength at the chosen operating frequency of 5.77 MHz, which is in the range of typical wireless biomedical implants. Such feature is obtained by virtue of an extremely compact connected double-spiral unit cell, which provides high inductance values despite the small size. We prove through numerical simulations that the proposed metasurface considerably lowers the electric field level with respect to traditional two- or three-coil WPT systems, while maintaining the same magnetic field level at the receiver. In addition, we conducted efficiency measurements on a fabricated prototype, confirming the performance of our design. The excellent efficiency enhancement, combined with the resulting low electric field, makes the proposed metasurface an attractive solution for a number of WPT applications, especially where the exposure in terms of specific absorption rate (SAR) is one of the major concerns, such as in biomedical implants and rechargeable devices.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2967320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8966613","Low frequency;magnetic field;metamaterial;metasurface;unit cell;wireless power transfer (WPT)","Metamaterials;Magnetic materials;Magnetic resonance;Magnetic separation;Magnetic susceptibility;Receivers;Surface impedance","","54","","50","IEEE","22 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
