The proposed technique operates solely on the transfer admittance matrix of a perfect electrically conducting antenna fabric that is obtained using a full-wave simulator only once. The desired antenna, which must be a subset of the fabric, is then synthesized by progressively loading the fabric and applying a computationally efficient iterative postprocessing technique that transforms the stored admittance matrix into one that corresponds to the desired antenna or array. Given that the admittance matrix of the fabric is used as the basis for all subsequent antennas that can be represented by the fabric, it contains the solutions to an entire class of antennas. The proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to the class of colinear antennas up to five wavelengths long, arranged along a single axis. The method is validated by comparing its results to those obtained using a conventional full-wave simulator. The proposed method is applied first to the case of multiple loads located at arbitrary port locations along the fabric. Then, open-circuited loads are used to decimate the tips of a linear antenna to demonstrate that the method accurately predicts the response of an electrically shorter antenna. Finally, decimation is used to transform the fabric into an array of smaller antennas, where it is shown that mutual coupling effects are accurately predicted.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3008624","Directorate of Technical Airworthiness and Engineering Support, Department of National Defence, Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9194368","Antenna decimation;loaded antenna;mutual coupling","Loaded antennas;Fabrics;Loading;Antenna arrays;Admittance;Method of moments","","3","","13","Crown","10 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The multipolarization antenna is realized by combining a bidirectional planar antenna with a carefully designed polarization rotating reflector. The reflector reflects and rotates the wave radiated from the bidirectional antenna. Then, two orthogonal waves of the same magnitude, including the reflected wave and the wave radiated directly from the bidirectional antenna, are obtained. Furthermore, the designed reflector helps to tune the phase difference between two orthogonal waves ranging from 90° to -180° with a monotonic continuous variation.

Complex J/K inverters are introduced to characterize couplings between CMs_iso_dri/par and their values are extracted from derived formulas. The requirements on values of these inverters are also derived for effective bandwidth enhancement. Several antenna examples with electric and magnetic couplings are presented for validation.

Starting from a low-profile shorted bowtie dipole antenna, it is found that by varying the shorting wall position, three different types of resonant antennas could be realized with different radiation features. A low-profile planar inverted F antenna (PIFA) -type dipole is obtained by moving the shorting wall toward the feeding, which exhibits a low resonance frequency without obvious back lobe radiation or sidelobes. When the shorting wall is placed in the middle of the radiating patch, a mushroom-type dipole antenna can be built. A zeroth-order mode is also observed. This structure differs from the magnetoelectric dipole due to a low-profile structure. Placing the wall toward the end of the dipole arm leads to a loop-type antenna with a broader beam and a reduced gain. It also shifts the resonance toward the higher frequency. Based on the PIFA- and mushroom-type structures, two circularly polarized antennas with crossed shorted dipoles are designed and investigated carefully. Finally, two optimized, compact, and low-cost RFID reader antennas based on simple metal stamping process and screws are designed, fabricated, and tested, showing an excellent RF reading range. This study demonstrates that for the shorted dipole antennas, miniaturization and bandwidth control can be achieved simultaneously. Particularly, for higher gain and smaller size, the shorting wall should be placed close to the feeding to suppress the loop mode. For omnidirectional radiation, the loop mode should be enhanced by moving the shorting wall close to the end of the dipole arm.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2998163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9107423","Antenna miniaturization;circular polarization;electric dipole;loop antenna;magnetic dipole;planar inverted F (PIFA) antenna;radio frequency identification (RFID) antenna;shorted dipole antenna","Dipole antennas;Radiofrequency identification;Resonant frequency;Magnetoelectric effects;Magnetic resonance imaging;Impedance;Inductors","","14","","43","IEEE","3 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna can also steer in diagonal and OFF-diagonal planes using a combination of the E and H plane steering techniques. Simultaneously, the antenna maintains a 2:1 VSWR for all the states.

The CMs of the aircraft platform provide the modal significances, modal currents, and modal radiation fields of each mode. An in-depth investigation over the useful CMs information is performed to prove the feasibility of design VHF band antenna array using the CMs of the platform. Switchable radiation patterns with horizontal polarization are then synthesized from these CMs. The switchable beams and polarization constraint make it more challenging than CM-based fixed power pattern synthesis. The polarized switchable beam synthesis is carried out with a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. A trade-off among the synthesized current distributions for different beam steering angles is made to determine the optimal current excitation locations for antenna array development. Meanwhile, a novel bandwidth enhanced triple-couple-line coupling element is proposed to allow aircraft platform flush-mounted designs.

Previous reports have also shown that HMS pairs are capable of realizing transformations that break the local power conservation requirement by redistributing the total power, while the wave propagates between the two metasurfaces. However, the required separation distance overshadows the low-profile characteristics of the individual metasurfaces and leads to bulky designs, especially for lower frequencies. In this article, we develop a method of designing omega-bianisotropic HMS pairs, relying on a point-matching process of the real power at the two metasurfaces. We highlight the versatility of our method by presenting two variations of the configuration, depending on whether the electromagnetic source is located within or outside the metasurface pair. Based on the examples of a cylindrical-wave to plane-wave transformation and a beam expander, we examine the impact of multiple reflections, as a way to overcome the size limitations and design compact structures. Moreover, we explore possible beamforming applications through an example of a Taylor-pattern antenna with a single feed-point between the two metasurfaces.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2995423","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development of Ontario and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto; Alexander S.

A single plane wave is matched to the boundary when it satisfies the boundary conditions identically. The wave vector of a matched wave is a solution of a dispersion equation characteristic to the boundary. The equation is of the second order, in general. Conditions for the boundary are studied under which the dispersion equation is reduced to one of the first order or to an identity, whence it is satisfied for any wave vector of the plane wave. It is shown that boundaries associated with a dispersion equation of the first order, form a natural generalization of the class of perfect electromagnetic conductor (PEMC) boundaries. As a consequence, the novel class is labeled as that of generalized PEMC (GPEMC) boundaries. In another case, boundaries for which there is no dispersion equation (NDE) for the matched wave (because it is an identity) are labeled as NDE boundaries. They are shown to be special cases of GPEMC boundaries. Reflection of the general plane wave from the GPEMC boundary is considered and an analytic expression for the reflection dyadic is found.

This leads to a high hardware effort and thus higher costs. To use a single, linear polarized radar sensor as a polarimetric system, a frequency-dependent, polarization rotating reflector which can be placed in front of the radar antenna is presented. The reflector is based on a frequency selective surface (FSS) consisting of slot-excited substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) resonators. Resonator modes are analyzed and an equivalent circuit diagram to describe the filter functionality is developed. For using the described FSS as reflective structure, the design focuses on 45° oblique incidence. Different field vectors for normal and oblique incident angles are considered and different cavity modes for these cases are analyzed. An undesired mode is suppressed by an additional plated through via hole and slot impedances are matched. Reflector designs for normal and oblique incident angles are presented for 15 GHz (Ku-band) and afterward adapted to 35 GHz (Ka-band). The frequency band of operation with 12% fractional bandwidth is divided into two 4.5% subbands which allows a frequency-dependent polarization rotation of a linear polarized electromagnetic wave. Investigations on the fabrication accuracies are presented and reflectors for both bands are manufactured. Measurements are performed with a vector network analyzer and results fit well to the simulated curves. In the band of polarization rotation reflection, the matching is better than -13 dB and dielectric losses of less than 1 dB are achieved.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3001430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119197","Frequency selective surface (FSS);polarization rotating surface;radar polarimetry;reflector;resonator;substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW)","Radar polarimetry;Frequency selective surfaces;Reflection;Radar antennas;Electromagnetic scattering;Resonators","","20","","17","CCBY","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although our sun and most other stars are spherical in shape at optical wavelengths, previous determinations of speckle and correlation functions have modeled stars as circular disks rather than spheres because of the mathematical tools available for partially coherent fields on planar surfaces. However, with the incentive that most stars are indeed shaped like spheres and not disks, this article models a star as a spherical antenna composed of a random distribution of uncorrelated volume sources within a thin surface layer (photosphere). Working directly with the time-domain fields, a self-contained, straightforward, detailed derivation of speckle patterns and correlation functions is given based on a novel, angularly symmetric, spherical mode expansion with coefficients determined by the assumed Lambertian nature of the star's radiation and the uniform asymptotic behavior of the spherical Hankel functions. First-order spatially averaged and temporally averaged correlation functions are proven to be identical, and the normalized second-order correlation function is shown to equal one plus the square of the first-order correlation function. The direct time-domain approach reveals explicit expressions for the quasi-monochromatic wave-packet fields of stellar radiation as well as new criteria for the validity of the far-field approximation for the fields of incoherent sources that are much less restrictive than the Rayleigh-distance criterion for coherent sources.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2997995","U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research through Dr. Arje Nachman under Contract(grant numbers:FA9550-19-1-0097); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9106790","Correlation;interferometry;spherical antennas;stellar speckle","Sun;Correlation;Optical surface waves;Surface waves;Speckle;Atmospheric modeling;Solid modeling","","4","","26","IEEE","2 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that the resulting line is a quadratic curve, e.g., an ellipse, in barycentric coordinates of the quadratic triangle, since the incident wave is a plane wave and the scattered fields are observed at the far-field. To evaluate the PO integral: 1) the PO integral is represented in barycentric coordinates and the type of the intersecting curve is determined; 2) an appropriate coordinate transformation is applied, e.g., elliptic coordinates for the ellipse; and then 3) the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule (GLQR) is applied.

Based on the previous pioneering work of memory-efficient SL-DGTD method, two improvements have been implemented to extend the scope of application. First, multiple kinds of cells, which can be placed arbitrarily on a square lattice, are allowed after a generalized interface recognition scheme. Therefore, besides the large finite periodic arrays successfully solved by previous memory-efficient SL-DGTD method, the aperiodic and/or the quasi-periodic array can be simulated with much less memory as well. Second, certain part of a cell can be cut out to form a new cell. In other words, the cells can be embedded hierarchically, and this is crucial for an efficient modeling of multiscale structures.

In this article, we present a macromodeling approach to efficiently simulate complex EM surfaces composed of PEC traces, possibly with fine features, on a finite-sized multilayer dielectric substrate. In our approach, we enclose each element of the structure with a fictitious surface. By applying the equivalence principle on each surface, we derive a macromodel for each element of the array. This macromodel consists of a linear operator that relates the equivalent electric and magnetic current densities introduced on the fictitious surface. Mutual coupling between the elements of the structure is captured by the equivalent current densities in a fully accurate way. The crux of the proposed technique is to solve for equivalent current densities on the fictitious surface instead of directly solving for the actual current densities on the original scatterer. When simulating complex surfaces, this approach leads to fewer unknowns and better conditioning. We also propose a rigorous acceleration algorithm based on the fast Fourier transform to simulate electrically large surfaces. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly faster and requires less memory than commercial solvers based on the surface integral equation method while giving accurate results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3000857","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Strategic Partnership Grants for Projects; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117019","Accelerated solvers;equivalence principle algorithm (EPA);macromodeling;metasurface;multiscale problems;reduced-order modeling;reflectarrays;surface integral equation (SIE) method","Electromagnetics;Nonhomogeneous media;Dielectric substrates;Current density;Acceleration;Antennas;Integral equations","","9","","55","IEEE","15 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is typically achieved by using one or multiple test probes to scan a sphere encompassing the device under test (DUT), which can be either set to transmit (Tx) or receive (Rx). Measurement data are usually collected in magnitude-only and near-field to FF transformations cannot be straightforwardly applied in a majority of test cases. In the case of large DUT, the active antenna in the device may not be located at the center of the measurement coordinate system, due to mechanical positioner or anechoic chamber constraints. Such an offset is known to introduce significant errors on assessed radiated quantities, which are mostly due to variations in the path length and the angular position of the apparent phase center of the Tx/Rx structure, with respect to the probe boresight direction. This article proposes a novel solution to this problem and introduces an algorithm to compensate errors from known antenna displacements within the coordinate system. This compensation applies to both OTA Tx and Rx cases. The accuracy of the identified solution is demonstrated through simulated and experimental results, using setups operating at 5G NR millimeter-wave frequencies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2999740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115827","5G mobile communication;antenna measurements;antenna radiation patterns;millimeter-wave communication","Probes;Antenna measurements;Antenna radiation patterns;Position measurement;Coordinate measuring machines;Noise measurement","","5","","19","IEEE","12 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The three fundamental blocks identified are: 1) the transmit and receive coils; 2) the matching network; and 3) the channel characteristics of the MFs. The first block explains how a single-dimensional coil is used to establish a directional communication link between a transmitter and a receiver and then the method by which the directionality problem is solved using multidimensional coils and metamaterial coils. Furthermore, the matching network explains the difference between the induction and resonance phenomena and their effect on the range and capacity.

Then, different from the previous works with the aid of additional harmonic rejected elements, a compact 50 Ω coplanar waveguide (CPW) with the function of an impedance transformer is employed to feed the antenna. After the proper design is executed, the TM01 mode could be well matched and those unwanted high-order modes are totally mismatched at impedance. The ultrawideband harmonic suppression is thus obtained and additional elements are not required at all. The equivalent circuit model is presented to give a clear insight into its working principle and a unified design procedure is generalized. Finally, two prototypes are designed, fabricated, and tested. The simulated and measured results are in good agreement with each other, certifying the validity of the proposed method. All these results show that an ultrawideband harmonic suppression (7 f0, f0 is the operating frequency) has been successfully achieved while keeping the omnidirectional radiation, low profile (0.037 λ0), and compact patch size (0.096 λ0 × 0.096 λ0, λ0 is the free-space wavelength at f0).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2995422","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971475,61571468); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under FDCT Research(grant numbers:0095/2019/A2); University of Macau under Multi-Year Research(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00007-FST,MYRG2018-00073-FST,CPG2017-00028-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099453","Compact configuration;harmonic suppression antenna (HSA);omnidirectional radiation;short-circuited ring-patch (SCRP) antenna;ultrawideband suppression","Antennas;Harmonics suppression;Resonant frequency;Manganese;Ultra wideband technology;Impedance;Power harmonic filters","","17","","34","IEEE","25 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the p-i-n diodes are in the OFF-state, the proposed structure performs broadband absorption functions from 3.7 to 10.7 GHz. When the p-i-n diodes are in the ON-state, those parallel lumped resistors are shorted and the structure transforms into a rectangular loop that converts the x(y) - to a y(x) -polarized one from 5.9 to 9.6 GHz.

This communication presents a strategy to realize the independent and arbitrary control of the amplitude and phase responses for the circularly polarized EM wave by using a dual-phase hybrid metasurface that integrates both geometric and propagation phases. A beam deflector with a tailorable amplitude is then designed to verify the proposed strategy. As a proof of concept of its practical application, a circularly polarized reflector antenna with a high gain and an extremely low sidelobe is implemented by the proposed metasurface. Experimental results are in good accordance with the simulation ones, demonstrating that the sidelobe of the designed antenna can be reduced by 8 dB compared with a reflector antenna actualized by the phase-only metasurface.

The transformation of the initial NP-hard problem to a convex optimization problem is described in detail. We applied the proposed algorithm to several MPT scenarios with multiple transmitting antennas around and one receiver placed near a box-shaped phantom model. The channel response and the electric field response for the receiver and phantom required for the optimization process are obtained using full-wave electromagnetic simulations. The received power and the power transfer efficiency (PTE) of the proposed optimization (OPT) technique are compared with those of the time-reversal (TR) technique at 0.9 GHz. The results show that the OPT technique can transfer more power than the TR technique with a lower PTE within the SAR limit and that the proposed technique can be applied to various MPT scenarios.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2981674","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIP)(grant numbers:2016R1E1A1A01943375); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9046256","Convex optimization;human safety;maximum received power;microwave wireless power transmission (MPT);specific absorption rate (SAR);time reversal (TR)","Optimization;Transmitting antennas;Phantoms;Receiving antennas;Specific absorption rate;Convex functions","","5","","26","IEEE","24 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this communication, we focus on the resolution performance of such imaging scheme, where we specifically demonstrate for the first time that the 3-D resolution can be achieved using the programmable microwave imager and a 3-D image reconstruction has been simulated successfully. We provide insights into the 3-D imaging resolution of programmable imager from two perspectives, i.e., the Ewald sphere and the point spread function (PSF). The influences on the 3-D imaging resolution of some important factors are theoretically and numerically investigated, including the distance between the object and the metasurface, the metasurface's size, and its coding style.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2986653","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066911","Microwave imaging;3-D resolution;programmable metasurface;Ewald sphere;point spread function (PSF)","Three-dimensional displays;Microwave imaging;Spatial resolution;Microwave communication","","22","","35","IEEE","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
