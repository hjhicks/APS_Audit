This history concentrates on the last 40 years of publication as the first 30 years are covered in an earlier article. The issues faced by each of the past 11 Editors-in-Chief (EiCs) since 1982 are outlined. In the first 20 years of this period, the main issue was the limited number of publishable pages, which was determined by society finances. The last 20 years have seen an exponential increase in submissions and the number of TAP pages published. The major reason for this increase has been the wireless revolution, which began in the late 1990s. Other changes have been that the editorial board has evolved from one or two non-North American members to today, where it is now fully international and gender diverse.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3287414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10159658","Antenna;editors;history;IEEE Society;impact factor (IF);propagation;time to publication;transactions","Antennas;Wireless communication;History;Delays;Indexes;Computers;Biographies","","4","","17","IEEE","22 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Proposal and Design of a Null Reconfigurable Patch Antenna on the Basis of Multimode Method","S. -T. Wang; L.

First, the characteristics of a multimode antenna are theoretically investigated with respect to mode combination and excitation. It is revealed that a small frequency span between the exploited modes is required for simultaneous excitation. Then, the null formation conditions are established based on a unified equivalent circuit model, thus, proving that the desired power ratio and phase difference can be simply achieved by tuning feeding locations and working frequency without needing any additional gain attenuators and phase shifters. To demonstrate the method, a single-plane null reconfigurable antenna (NRA) on a rectangular patch is then presented by extracting the excitation coefficients. Besides, a feeding network is proposed for state switching and impedance matching. To further improve the null angle coverage and show the generality of the proposed method, a hemispherical NRA on a circular patch is employed to design an NRA whose pattern null can be reconfigured in the upper hemisphere. In final, both prototypes are fabricated and measured. A good agreement between simulated and measured results verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method and proves its potential applicability to other types of antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3276512","National Natural Science Foundation of China through the General Program(grant numbers:61971475); Science and Technology Development Fund of Macao under FDCT Research(grant numbers:0085/2020/AMJ,0080/2021/A2); University of Macau(grant numbers:CPG2023-00020-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130103","Multimode;null reconfigurable antenna (NRA);null steering;patch antenna;pattern reconfigurable antenna (PRA)","Resonant frequency;Patch antennas;Tuning;Directive antennas;Phased arrays;Loading;Impedance","","5","","45","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A three-state-reconfigurable network is designed, which is realized by two 3-dB bridges sharing a branch integrated with p-i-n diodes. The patch antenna can be excited to receive distinct polarized waves at 5.8 GHz by controlling p-i-n diodes’ ON or OFF state. In addition, a high-efficiency rectifier network includes two rectifier circuits integrating with a circulator for optimal input power. The function of the rectifier circuit 1 is to convert the radio frequency (RF) power in the power transfer link into direct current (dc) power. Rectifier circuit 2, as a part of the polarization control link, aims to use the energy reflected by the rectifier circuit 1 to provide a dc bias for the p-i-n diodes. A polarization-reconfigurable antenna without an external dc power source is realized. Finally, a WPT system is established based on the proposed self-powered polarized reconfigurable rectenna. The measured results show that the proposed rectenna has a maximum conversion efficiency of 66% at 5.8 GHz and a conversion efficiency higher than 50% in the incident power range from 21 to 30 dBm.

The framework is built on our innovations in tandem neural networks consisting of two cascaded neural networks. Our structures are parameterized in an exponentially large design space of discrete variables (pixels), leading to the realization of nonintuitive structures. This end-to-end synthesis in terms of discrete variables is enabled by introducing a new type of “smooth thresholding” (ST) activation function, which, along with crucial regularization terms in the network loss function, aids in designing our structures. We perform extensive neural network optimizations and study various trade-offs in the design process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by generating single and dual-band resonant structures, which can be up to 50% more compact in terms of area, and up to 18% thinner in terms of substrate height than conventional structures, while retaining competitive performance parameters in terms of gain, polarization properties, radiation efficiency (RE), and fractional bandwidth (FBW).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3276524","Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India, through the Project “6G: Sub-THz Wireless Communication with Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS)”(grant numbers:R-23011/3/2022-CC&BT-MeitY); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130105","Antennas;artificial intelligence;design automation;microstrip antennas;optimization methods","Antennas;Neural networks;Microstrip antennas;Electromagnetics;Training;Performance evaluation;Dual band","","45","","46","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through a simple model of fields in a parallel-plate waveguide, a linear system of equations can be defined and solved to find the peripheral source excitations that best approximate a desired field pattern. This model is used to solve for a uniform broadside beam and yields a higher aperture illumination efficiency than a broadside beam obtained from an equal-amplitude excitation.

First, the bottom layer patch is meticulously designed based on a modified TM11 mode to meet the matching conditions. Then, the structures of the parasitic layer patches are contrived to form similar peripheral radiative current distributions compared with the bottom one, aiming to simplify the analysis process. After that, the three-layer patches are stacked in a capacitively coupled fashion, which guarantees the out-of-phase scheme between the middle layer patch and the other two-layer patches. By means of the cavity-model theorem, further investigations on the multilayer distributions of the equivalent magnetic currents for the three radiators have successfully demonstrated that the destructive interference among the currents will result in the emergence of radiation nulls for both the E-plane and H-plane patterns. As a result, the beamwidth of the antenna in the two principal planes can be narrowed, which contributes to a significant improvement in the overall gain performance. Furthermore, a thorough array factor analysis on the flexible control of the radiation nulls is highlighted with both the theoretical predictions and full-wave quantitative verifications.

This leads to much reduced cross-band coupling between the LB and HB antennas. The proposed methods are applied to a “one LB + one HB” dual-band array configuration with only one LB cross dipole and one HB cross dipole placed side-by-side to exclude the effects of the array topology. The robustness of the proposed methods is comprehensively verified for different scenarios by simulations and experiments.

Subsequently, a mechanically controlled, reflection-type phase shifter consisting of a branch line coupler and two Pi-network reflective loads is presented. A movable metallic overlay tunes the impedance of the reflective loads, thus effectively modifying the output phase.

The out-of-band RCS of the reflectarray for both the TE and TM polarized incident waves is reduced by replacing its ground with an absorptive frequency selective reflector (AFSR). A systematic methodology based on the synthesis of the equivalent circuit model (ECM) is presented to expedite the design of the AFSR. The unit phasing element of the reflectarray is designed in such a way that it exhibits minimum coupling between the two orthogonal reflected LP-field components. Moreover, during the reflectarray construction, a novel phase synthesis is used which takes into account the possible lowest of the existing mutual coupling while providing quadrature phase difference between the orthogonal LP components with minimum phase error. The proposed design is fabricated using  $14\times 14$  phasing elements to experimentally validate the numerically simulated results. The performance of the reflectarray is compared with a conventional reflectarray without the AFSR. It is observed that when the reflectarray is integrated with the AFSR, its gain is reduced only by 1.16 dB. However, its out-of-band RCS is reduced significantly. The 8-dB RCS reduction bandwidth can be observed from 3.55 to 7.2 GHz (67.9%) and from 11.85 to 14.21 GHz (18.11%).

This article details, for the first time, both the electromagnetic and temporal characterization of four commercially available DFLC mixtures in W-band, enabling their use in designing faster devices. To evaluate the experimental characterization, a reflectarray surface (made of 50 × 50 cells) specifically designed to achieve fast switching times with a sufficient phase range has been manufactured and measured. For this cell, a preliminary addressing technique based on overdriving has been used, exhibiting reconfigurability (rise and decay) times of 20 ms, one order of magnitude faster than the current state of the art of LC-based mm-wave planar devices. The measured results match the simulations and reveal that a precisely designed biasing technique using overdrive (OD) must be used for DFLC-cells to achieve time reduction.

A variety of FDA schemes are proposed to focus the beam energy on the interested spot with a fixed range and angle, namely, the dot-shaped beampattern. However, the time-variance of the FDA beampattern makes it unavailable for practical engineering applications. Thus, some time-invariant techniques have then been analyzed and designed. Although the state-of-the-art publications have pointed out that the time-invariant FDA transmit beampattern is incorrect based on the range–time–frequency relationship, the newly designed joint transmit–receive FDA beampattern cannot be explained by the current theories. In this article, the time–range relationship is reviewed, and the traditional FDA, the time-modulated weighted FDA (TMW-FDA), and the transmit–receive FDA schemes are deeply analyzed.

A key challenge for MTS to generate multiple independent beams is the mutual interference of different impedance modulations. This interference can lead to reduced directivities of main beams and high sidelobe levels (SLLs). A full-wave-based optimization for a large number of beams is significantly time-consuming and practically ineffective. The source locations are optimized here by employing the aperture field calculated from a zeroth-order approximation (ZOA) of the currents on the surface. This provides a good preliminary accuracy without any full-wave analysis. The relevant design method is verified by two examples of three-beam and seven-beam MTS antennas. Furthermore, the seven-beam MTS antenna is fabricated and successfully measured. The measurements show a measured realized gain of 20 dBi at 14.10 GHz with a beam coverage (10-dB overlap) up to ±36°.

The antenna operates in dual working bands with right-handed circular polarization (RHCP) from 17.7 to 21.2 GHz and left-handed circular polarization (LHCP) from 27.5 to 31.0 GHz. For the K-/Ka-band shared-aperture beam-scanning array antenna, the main challenge is to simultaneously achieve a wide beam scanning range, low profile, and high cross-band isolation. Compared to high-profile endfire duplexing or filtering antennas, planar laminated antennas have a stronger coupling between two elements operated at different frequency bands. In this design, two embedded two-stage filters are proposed and integrated into the dual-band feeders. The minimum spacing between the elements is 1/4 wavelength, and both in-band wideband impedance matching and cross-band filtering are performed simultaneously. First, two square lattices with a 45° rotation angle between them and a non-stacked topology are employed in the design of uniform arrays for both bands. This design is better suited for this filtering array. Second, to improve CP performance during beam scanning, the Ka-band-induced current on the K-band radiator should be suppressed. The rotary feed phase and the segmented patch are used to suppress the induced current and produce the reverse induced current in the small and large beam scanning area, respectively. Finally, the equivalent circuits and chain matrices are used to design the filtering feeders. As a result, the dual cross-band isolations increase to 38 and 41 dB. The total profile is less than 3.2 mm, much smaller than the existing K-/Ka-band filtering antenna’s profile of 10 mm, and the proposed design also has a wide operating bandwidth and a large beam scanning range of ±60°.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3284163","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1806202); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U22A2016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10151799","Circular polarization;K-/Ka-band;low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication;low profile;shared aperture beam-scanning array antenna","Antenna arrays;Topology;Antennas;K-band;Polarization;Filtering;Low earth orbit satellites","","28","","43","IEEE","13 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we propose a simple and comprehensive strategy to design and optimize the HMS antenna. The strategy builds an equivalent model of the HMS antenna and deals with the designs from the perspective of phase optimization, which is simple and straightforward. A fast and efficient algorithm is presented to solve the optimization problem under the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The phases obtained by this strategy are naturally compatible with the passive and lossless conditions and can be directly implemented by metasurfaces. Furthermore, the strategy imposes constraints on the phase difference of adjacent meta-atoms, thus reducing the performance deterioration caused by aperiodic boundary conditions.

Furthermore, the article shows that the modern formulation of Weber electrodynamics is clearly superior to standard electrodynamics in electrical engineering, because it not only eliminates internal contradictions, but also represents considerable simplification and compression.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3278078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10134544","Computational electromagnetics;electromagnetic forces;electromagnetic propagation;vector wave equation;weber electrodynamics","Electrodynamics;Force;Propagation;Maxwell equations;Standards;Magnetic fields;Electromagnetic scattering","","1","","22","IEEE","24 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The 5G system has expanded its frequency range and widened the bandwidth to achieve higher throughput rates and more stable wireless qualities, which brings new challenges to the over-the-air (OTA) MIMO evaluations. The wide bandwidth introduces systematic uncertainties into the MIMO measurement because of the increased amplitude and phase variation issues under different frequencies in the wideband signals, and it could lead to valid MIMO throughput measurement results when severe. The effect on antenna isolation resulting from amplitude and phase variation in wideband MIMO measurements is analyzed based on the radiated two-stage (RTS) MIMO measurement method. A wideband inverse matrix algorithm is introduced to solve this issue and improve the wideband MIMO antenna isolation. The proposed method can be used in both multiple probe anechoic chamber (MPAC) and RTS chambers, which paves the way for decreasing the OTA measurement uncertainties on both 5G sub-6-GHz wideband MIMO and millimeter-wave MIMO evaluations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3276443","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971083,51939001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130097","Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO);over the air (OTA);radiated two-stage (RTS);wideband inverse matrix","MIMO communication;Antenna measurements;Wideband;Receiving antennas;Measurement uncertainty;5G mobile communication;Transmitting antennas","","1","","19","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The parameters of a multipath data model in terms of directions, time-of-flight, and Doppler shift are estimated from observations in frequency, time, and space. A maximum likelihood estimation framework allows joint high resolution in all dimensions. The prerequisite for this is an appropriate parametric data model that represents the multipath propagation correctly. At the same time, a device data model is necessary that typically results from calibration measurements. The used model should be as simple as possible, since its structure has a considerable effect on the estimation effort. For instance, the inherent effort in parameter search is reduced if the influence of the parameters is kept independent. Therefore, the data model is characterized by several approximations. The most important is the “narrowband assumption,” which assumes a low relative bandwidth and also avoids considering any frequency response in magnitude and phase. We extend the well-known multidimensional Richter maximization approach (RIMAX) parameter estimation framework by including proper frequency responses. The advantage reveals itself with high bandwidth in the mmWave and sub-THz range. It allows for a more realistic modeling of antenna arrays, and it breaks with the usual narrowband model and allows a better modeling of mutual coupling and time delay effects. If the interacting object extends over several delay bins (hence, an extended target in radar terminology), we propose a model that assigns a short delay spread and a frequency response to the propagation path that associates it with the respective object. We verify the validity of the device model by numerical experiments on simulated and measured antenna data and compare it with RIMAX. In addition, we use synthetic data based on ray-tracing results and measurements both ranging from 27.0 to  $\mathrm {33 \text {G} \text {Hz} }$  with known ground-truth information and show that the proposed estimator delivers better performance for higher relative bandwidths than the conventional RIMAX implementation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3286024","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the Project “HoPaDyn”(grant numbers:TH 494/30-1); Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy through the Research and Development Program 5G-Bavaria; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155651","Algorithms;antenna arrays;array signal processing;maximum likelihood estimation;parameter estimation","Data models;Antenna arrays;Antenna measurements;Estimation;Wideband;Frequency estimation;Channel estimation","","14","","36","IEEE","19 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These equations have been shown to be robust at low frequencies and immune to topology breakdown. But they mimic the ill-conditioning behavior of CFIE at high frequencies. This article addresses this deficiency through new Calderón-type identities derived from the vector potential integral equation (VPIE). We construct novel analytic preconditioners for the VPIE and scalar potential integral equation (SPIE) constrained to perfect electric conductors (PECs).

For high-density chaff elements, their scattering properties can be calculated quickly and accurately by the vector radiative transfer (VRT). During the process, Monte Carlo solver is used to simulate the energy change of photons and the coupling effect among chaffs. Meanwhile, the advanced integral equation model (AIEM) is applied to calculate the electromagnetic scattering energy of the sea.

The transverse static modes are the eigenmodes, with zero surface-divergence, of the magnetostatic integral operator that determines the tangential component of the vector potential, as a function of the surface current density.

The static modes expansion allows for the regularization of the integral operators and also leads to a significant reduction in the number of unknowns compared to a discretization based on sub-domain basis functions.

The coefficient matrix depends on the permittivity values in the MoM solution to the scattering problem. Therefore, it requires matrix inversion whenever these values change slightly. Here, we propose a new expression where the matrix coefficients are independent of the permittivity values of each homogeneous part. Accordingly, when the geometry does not change, we propose a semi-explicit procedure for updating the solution with less computational complexity. Although the proposed method can be used for all 2-D and 3-D problems, the formulation details are implemented for 2-D problems, TM incidence.

However, when it is electrostatically- and magnetostatically-biased, it exhibits anisotropy described by a surface conductivity tensor. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the shielding effectiveness (SE) of anisotropic graphene in the RF/microwave region. Since graphene’s thickness is many orders of magnitude smaller than the shortest wavelength in the considered regime, it does not affect substantially the computation of the fields. For this reason, we replace the graphene layer with a surface current boundary condition (SCBC), hence its effect is equivalent to a surface electric current density. We employ the method of auxiliary sources (MAS) to analyze a planar and a cylindrical shielding configuration. For the cylindrical shield, the derived MAS results are compared with the exact solutions, which are also extracted.

The full 3-D patterns of all antenna elements in the array need to be characterized because they are in general different due to construction inaccuracy, coupling, antenna array’s asymmetry, etc. The effective aperture distribution function (EADF) can provide an analytic description of an antenna array based on a full-sphere measurement of the array in an anechoic chamber. However, as the array aperture increases, denser spatial samples are needed for EADF due to large distance offsets of array elements from the reference point in the anechoic chamber, leading to a prohibitive measurement time and increased complexity of EADF. In this article, we present the EADF applied to large-scale arrays and highlight issues caused by the large array aperture. To overcome the issues, an enhanced EADF is proposed with a low complexity that is intrinsically determined by the characteristic of each array element rather than the array aperture. The enhanced EADF is validated using experimental measurements conducted at 27–30 GHz frequency band with a relatively large planar array.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3286099","Horizon Europe Framework Program under the Marie Skodowska-Curie(grant numbers:101059091); Swedish Research Council(grant numbers:2022-04691); Strategic Research Area Excellence Center at Linköping — Lund in Information Technology (ELLIIT), Excellence Center at Link Ping Lund in Information Technology; Fordonsstrategisk Forskning och Innovation (FFI) Simulation and Verification of Wireless Technologies 2 (SIVERT 2) Project Supported by VINNOVA, Sweden’s Innovation Agency, and Ericsson; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155666","Antenna measurement;array characterization;channel parameter estimation;large-scale array","Antenna arrays;Antenna measurements;Array signal processing;Aperture antennas;Frequency measurement;Anechoic chambers;Probes","","9","","25","EU","19 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method adopted in this article belongs to the family of methods of analytical preconditioning. The revolution symmetry allows us to reduce the problem to an infinite set of dual integral equations in the vector Hankel transform (VHT) domain for suitable unknowns vanishing outside the hole. Such equations are transformed into matrix equations by means of the Helmholtz-Galerkin discretization technique. The orthogonal eigenfunctions of the most singular part of the integral operator, reconstructing the behavior of the fields at the edge and around the center of the hole, are selected as expansion functions, thus leading to fast converging Fredholm second-kind matrix equations, whose elements can be expressed as quickly evaluable proper integrals.

However, these systems often rely on time-consuming image reconstruction techniques, which are disadvantageous for timely stroke treatment. In this article, a novel microwave medical sensing (MMS) method is proposed for fast stroke classification and localization, which utilizes space division of the region under examination (RUE) (i.e., the head). The space division is enabled by the generalized scattering matrix (GSM) theory and incorporates the brain anatomy. Then a novel decision-tree learning method is proposed, which facilitates efficient stroke feature identification for classification. The spatial information acquired from the decision-tree also results in rapid stroke localization. To verify the proposed method, we investigate the feasibility of classifying brain strokes between an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) stroke and an ischemic stroke (IS) with a wearable MMS system. Both numerical and experimental results are obtained. Compared to the traditional method, the classification rates for simulation and experimental results are improved by 14.1% and 19.2%, respectively. Furthermore, by utilizing the a priori information, the localization time is reduced by 21.1%. Finally, the localization accuracy is higher than 0.90 in both simulation and experimental studies. The classification accuracy and localization efficiency are shown to be greatly improved compared to the traditional method, which has great significance for wearable devices.

The basic antenna element is a pair of parallel folded dipoles (PFDs) connected at the terminals. Compared with a single half-wavelength dipole, the PFD can achieve a flatter impedance curve in the working frequency band, and it is easier to achieve broadband impedance matching with 50- $\Omega $  feeding line. Moreover, a coupling slot feeding method is adopted to feed the proposed antenna element. The capacitance provided by the coupling slot can counteract the inductance caused by the PFD, thus improving the impedance matching at the low-frequency band. Benefiting from the innovative design, the proposed antenna element can achieve an ultra-wide impedance bandwidth of 64% and a compact size of  $0.26\lambda _{0} \times 0.28\lambda _{0}$ . Furthermore, a wide scanning angle with ±50° over wide bandwidth is testified by a  $1\times8$  array using active simulation. For verification, a  $4\times4$  full corporate-fed array is designed based on the proposed element. The measured results prove that the proposed  $4\times4$  array has a −10 dB impedance bandwidth of 65% covering 17–33.75 GHz and a peak gain of 17.5 dBi. The measured total efficiency is from 69% to 82% over the working frequency band.

Short parasitic strips or slots are added to both sides of the dipole or slot antenna. In the third mode, the reversed current or E-field will destroy the omnidirectivity or bidirectivity of these two antennas. But, the induced current or E-field on the parasitic elements is opposite to that on the original antenna canceling the effect of the reversed current or E-field. As a result, the radiation patterns of the dipole and slot in the third mode are reshaped to be omnidirectional or bidirectional, respectively. The effects of parasitic element length, spacing, and position on radiation patterns have also been studied. Besides, it is proved that parasitic loops have the same effect. For simplifying impedance matching, a novel feeding method for slot antenna is designed especially without using lumped elements. Two prototypes, dipole and slot antennas with parasitic elements, were fabricated and tested to validate the concept. The measured results are in good agreement with the simulated ones.

The reflectarray is an all-metal planar structure and is composed of unit-cells featuring perpendicularly placed size-variable slots carved in a metal sheet. Owing to negligible interactions between orthogonal slots of the unit-cell, a multipolarized metal-only reflectarray with dual-linear and dual-circular operations can be realized by rotation of a linearly polarized (LP) feed with 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°, respectively. For proof-of-concept, a prototype hosting 441 unit-cells and operating at X-band is manufactured and measured. The testing data reveals that the proposed design can achieve reasonable 1 dB gain drop bandwidths and peak aperture efficiencies for all polarizations, for instance, 15.3% and 45% in the case of right-hand circular polarization (RHCP). Moreover, the 3 dB axial ratio bandwidths for RHCP and left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) are also wide, which are 26% and 39%, respectively. These satisfactory behavior as well as the metal-only configuration make our design a competitive candidate for multi-polarization applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3275468","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871223); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127641","Low-cost;low-profile;metal-only;multi-polarization;reflectarray antenna (RA)","Feeds;Substrates;Bandwidth;Apertures;Reflector antennas;Behavioral sciences;Prototypes","","16","","30","IEEE","16 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The wide-angle scanning array with four elements is achieved with a small element spacing of  $0.3\lambda _{0}$ . Two critical difficulties for the compact array with  $0.3\lambda _{0}$  spacing are the realization of the small element and the mutual coupling reduction between each element. For the small antenna element, a modified quarter-wavelength shorted patch antenna (SPA) element working at 25.5–27.5 GHz is designed. The coupled shorted structure and coupled feeding structure of the element are designed to reduce the H-plane cross-polarization level (XPL) which is a key drawback of quarter-wavelength SPA. For the mutual coupling of the four-element array with  $0.3\lambda _{0}$  spacing, three compact neutralization lines (NLs) are applied to reduce the mutual coupling to better than −15 dB. Finally, the proposed compact four-element array only occupies a small size of  $1.14\times 0.3\lambda _{0}$ , which is the smallest mm-wave four-element array in the open literature. Also, the proposed array can scan from −60° to 60° with a peak gain of 9 dBi, a gain fluctuation of less than 1.3 dB, a good sidelobe level (SLL), and an acceptable XPL. The proposed mm-wave array with the superior performance of small array size and wide beam scanning is promising for modern mobile phones.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3278872","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101133); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:21ZR1406800); Shanghai Rising Star Program(grant numbers:22QC1400100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10137450","Array antenna;compact;millimeter-wave (mm-wave) antenna;mobile phones;wide-angle scanning","Antenna arrays;Antennas;Patch antennas;Electric fields;Mutual coupling;Mobile handsets;Substrates","","13","","40","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proof is based on the reflection properties of the electric and magnetic fields through PMCs and PECs, and it is valid for arbitrary oblique incidence. As an application of this concept, the spectral-domain method of moments (SD-MoM) is reformulated to deal with MPSs limited by PMCs and PECs, and it is used in the design of a mirror-symmetric multilayered linear polarization (LP)-to-circular polarization (CP) converter. The results obtained with SD-MoM are validated by comparison with commercial software CST. Numerical simulations show that the CPU time required by both SD-MoM and CST in the analysis of half the LP-to-CP converter limited by PMC and PEC is between 30% and 42% smaller than that required by the analysis of the complete LP-to-CP converter, which shows the numerical advantage gained in exploiting the symmetry when it is present.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3285364","MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033(grant numbers:PID2020-116739GB-I00); Spanish Ministry of Universities, Plan de Recuperación, Transformación y Resiliencia (PRTR), and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM)(grant numbers:CA2/RSUE/2021-00325); European Union “NextGenerationEU”/PRTR(grant numbers:PID2020-116968RB-C32,TED2021-130650B-C21); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154616","Multilayered media;periodic structures;polarization conversion","Metallization;Electric fields;Conductors;Periodic structures;Mirrors;Scattering;Microwave circuits","","1","","21","IEEE","16 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for CATR in the form of a multi-reflector or large aperture, the size of geometric space is an optimization metric that needs attention. In this communication, the proposed method combines the intelligent optimization algorithm with the B-spline surface-shaped algorithm closely, which allows the design of tri-reflector CATR with arbitrary aperture, and satisfactory results are achieved for electromagnetic characteristics and geometric space. The former optimizes the size of geometric space, and the latter generates the two shaped sub-reflectors under the condition that the geometric space reaches the global optimum. Finally, the designed tri-reflector CATR is simulated by physical optics (PO) and physical theory of diffraction (PTD) in GRASP10.

Conventionally, the CBFM is implemented to reduce the solution time at a single frequency. However, wide band analysis of the above problem is still time consuming when a large number of frequency samples (FSs) are employed with uniform sampling. To mitigate this issue and improve efficiency, the AFS algorithm is proposed to select FSs with a reduced number via an iterative process based on error-estimators. The vector-fitting (VF) algorithm is used to derive the rational model, which allows to generate the scattered fields in the band efficiently. The key feature of the proposed AFS is it minimizes the number of the FSs and guarantees the convergence of the solution simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that the number of required samples is significantly reduced without compromising the accuracy of the solution.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3281058","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901189); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10144544","Buried object;characteristic basis function method (CBFM);fast frequency sweep;layered media;vector fitting (VF)","Mathematical models;Method of moments;Computational modeling;Convergence;Silicon;Numerical models;Nonhomogeneous media","","5","","21","IEEE","5 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
