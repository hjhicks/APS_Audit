Mechanical scanning using two transmit arrays (TAs) with independent axial rotation movements—known as the Risley prism approach—is being considered as a potential enabling technology for many cost-driven applications. There is an ongoing research effort to improve this solution, and however, grating lobes are still a main limitation for the operation of these antennas. Herein, we show that this vestigial effect can be overcome by a codesign of the phase correction of the two rotating surfaces, instead of considering each TA as a separate “prism” (the conventional approach). The proposed generalized phase correction is compared with the conventional counterpart using a design example based on fully dielectric TAs. Experimental results confirm that the predicted grating lobes of the conventional design can be mitigated, corresponding to a significant reduction of the sidelobe level (SLL) in the complete scanning plane. For the given full-dielectric Ka-band design example, it is possible to scan up to 55° with SLL  $ < -8.3$  dB and scan loss of −3.6 dB, whereas, with the conventional approach, the same scan implies SLL  $ < -4.4$  dB and a scan loss of −6.1 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3313230","Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT) through the Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER)—PT2020 Partnership Agreement(grant numbers:Project PTDC/EEI-TEL/30323/2017-LISBOA-01-0145-FEDER); Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) through the European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:101097101); U.K. Research and Innovation (UKRI) through the U.K. Government’s Horizon Europe Funding Guarantee; European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) through the COST Action Symat (CA18223); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10251119","Beam steering;dielectric antennas;millimeter-wave antennas;rotating bodies;satellite mobile communication;scanning antennas;sidelobe suppression;transmit array (TA)","Gratings;Microwave antennas;Apertures;Transmitting antennas;Harmonic analysis;Europe;Satellites","","16","","16","IEEE","13 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They typically have a dispersive traveling wave leading to beam squinting behavior, which can significantly decrease the useful operating bandwidth in point-to-point communications. An innovative method that avoids beam squint with frequency over a wide band is developed in this work using a negative dispersion slope. By integrating a baffle of square bracket-shaped metal pieces into a transverse-slot LWA, the main beam angle is almost fixed at an angle,  $\theta = 37^{\circ } \pm 2^{\circ }$ , across a wide frequency band from 9.5 to 12.2 GHz. The wide bandwidth is a consequence of the negative dispersion slope produced by the interaction between the baffle and the slotted waveguide. In the  $\theta = 37^{\circ }$  direction, the gain variation is less than 3 dB across this band. Equivalent circuit analysis and full-wave modeling are presented to demonstrate the negative-slope dispersion diagram. The obtained 3-dB gain curve exhibits a filter characteristic. In addition, the bandwidth can be chosen by a suitable selection of parameters. It is the first time that these desirable features have been reported for wideband fixed-beam LWAs. The final antenna was fabricated with a low-cost additive manufacturing (3-D printing) technology. The measured results agree well with the simulated ones and verify the effectiveness of the antennas developed in this way.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3310005","2022 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society Fellowship Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10241313","3-D printing;leaky wave antennas (LWAs);low-cost;negative dispersion slope;slot array;wideband fixed-beam","Dispersion;Wideband;Metals;Equivalent circuits;Broadband antennas;Antennas;Gain","","3","","54","IEEE","5 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna consists of a feeding probe as the source of the TA and an annular receiving/transmitting (Re/Tr) array surrounding the probe. The Re/Tr unit cell is composed of a pair of back-to-back angled dipoles and a delay line. The unit cell utilizes the rotation freedom of the direction of the Tr unit for a 0°/180° phase shift (1 bit), and an additional delay line between the Re and Tr cells for a continuous phase shift between 180°. Then, 1 bit+ Re/Tr unit cells with a continuous phase shift between 0° and 360° are built to form an omnidirectional array. By tuning the phase distribution of the longitudinal cells, the array can compress a wide conical omnidirectional beam from the probe radiator into a high-gain narrow omnidirectional beam in the azimuth plane. Measurement results show that the operating bandwidth of the antenna is 14.2% (from 26.1 to 30.1 GHz), within which the antenna can achieve a high gain of around 8.0 dBi and a stable omnidirectional beam. The design that transplants the concept of TA into a high-gain omnidirectional antenna is proposed for the first time.

Unlike standard (laboratory-based) validations reported in the state-of-the-art (SoA) literature, the scenario at hand mimics a realistic indoor environment to replicate as close as possible the user experience (UE) when using commodity devices. Representative results from the experimental field trials are reported to confirm the performance predictions arising from the numerical studies and the tolerance analyses carried out with a commercial ray-tracing (RT) tool. Besides experimentally validating the SEME idea, this study is also aimed at (roughly) quantifying the economic advantage of an SEME implementation, relying on simple manufacturing/low-cost field manipulating devices without any additional biasing circuitry, with respect to standard approaches that imply the densification of the active radiating sources.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3305053","Project “Smart ElectroMagnetic Environment in TrentiNo - SEME@TN”; Autonomous Province of Trento (CUP: C63C22000720003), the Project “SPEED”(grant numbers:6721001); National Science Foundation of China under the Chang-Jiang Visiting Professorship Program, the Project “ICSC National Centre for HPC, Big Data and Quantum Computing (CN HPC)”; European Union - NextGenerationEU within the PNRR Program (CUP: E63C22000970007), and the Project “AURORA - Smart Materials for Ubiquitous Energy Harvesting, Storage, and Delivery in Next Generation Sustainable Environments”; Italian Ministry for Universities and Research within the PRIN-PNRR 2022 Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10227906","Experimental assessment;indoor;ray tracing (RT);smart electromagnetic environment (SEME);static-passive EM skins (SP-EMSs);Wi-Fi","Wireless communication;Buildings;Wireless fidelity;Electromagnetics;Power distribution;Skin;Ad hoc networks","","9","","53","IEEE","23 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The radiated electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by the induced current on the RFR’s surface determine the feed-array source distribution. The second method directly projects the ideal planar source onto the RFR’s surface with phase adjustment. The EM fields radiated by the surface current are then employed to synthesize the source distribution of the feed array. The third method employs conjugate field matching optimization to determine the array source distribution. The difference beams are synthesized by employing Gram–Schmidt’s orthogonalization method.

To simultaneously support multiple communication standards in a shared aperture, base-station antennas need a wide stopband with high rejection to maintain sufficient isolation from other operating frequencies. However, this usually requires filtennas to be designed with multiple radiation nulls, which makes the filtennas difficult to match. Therefore, without an additional impedance-matching circuit, it is challenging to achieve a filtenna with sufficient impedance matching in the passband, wide stopband, and high out-of-band rejection. To solve this problem, we propose a multipath-coupled filtenna with enhanced stopbands. The proposed filtenna consists of two stacked patch radiators connected by four metal strips, a crossed feeder, and four hooked strips. The wide stopband was obtained by four radiation nulls introduced by these structures. To improve the impedance matching in the passband, four metal strips were used to connect the two stacked patches to tune the coupling between them. Finally, a prototype was fabricated and measured. The measurement results show that the proposed filtenna has a passband of 3.3–3.8 GHz with an average gain of 8.9 dBi and an upper stopband up to 7 GHz with an out-of-band suppression more than 19 dB.

Unlike the scattering suppression designs of existing antennas, the inevitable higher-order-mode reflection at ultrawideband frequency has been considered to realize the hPA’s mRCS amplitude regulation. With perfect absorption for in-band RCS reduction, the reflection coefficient with the higher-order-mode condition has been integrated into the antenna mode scattering to accomplish the hPA’s out-of-band mRCS reduction.

The exploration and development of ocean resources depend on underwater communication, so it is promising to study the communication of low-frequency (LF) ME antennas in seawater environments with lossy media.

A theoretical justification of this behavior is found through the rigorous treatment of the canonical problem of an infinite homogenized impedance surface sinusoidally modulated along the propagation direction. By deriving a closed-form solution of this problem at broadside scan, it is shown that, while the sinusoidally modulated isotropic impedance exhibits a null of the attenuation constant, the complex propagation constant for the proposed anisotropic modulation has a finite value and a regular behavior. A closed-form formula for the leakage constant  $\boldsymbol {\alpha }$  is also derived, allowing for an accurate design of the aperture field amplitude. The full-wave analysis of a patch-based implementation of the MTS is in excellent agreement with the results based on the homogenized impedance model, thus demonstrating the practical applicability of the theoretical results. The elimination of the OSB behavior allows for the design of LWAs able to scan the beam from backward (BWD) to forward (FWD) without any frequency regions of blindness.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3312596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10247212","1-D periodic modulation;broadside radiation;Floquet theorem;leaky-wave antennas (LWAs);metasurfaces (MTSs);open stopband (OSB);periodic structures","Impedance;Surface impedance;Slabs;Periodic structures;Frequency modulation;Metasurfaces;Mathematical models","","8","","34","CCBY","11 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna hybridizes folded transmitarray (FTA) for the lower band and folded reflectarray (FRA) for the upper band. The top metasurface employs the receiver–transmitter (Rx–Tx) structure and works as a polarization grid to collimate electromagnetic (EM) waves at the lower band. In addition, this top metasurface realizes wave conversion from linear polarization to circular polarization for dual bands. Meanwhile, a double-layer bottom metasurface realizes wave collimation at the upper band and 90° polarization twisting in both bands. In this way, right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) at 26 GHz and left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) at 39 GHz are achieved simultaneously. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid antenna is fed by a wideband magneto-electric (ME) dipole with a single LP. This planar ME dipole is inherently integrated with the bottom metasurface. For validation, a dual-band antenna including a top metasurface and a bottom metasurface is designed, fabricated, and measured. The height-to-diameter ratio (H/D) is only 0.22 for FTA and 0.24 for FRA, while the 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidths are 11.4% (24.9–27.9 GHz) and 4.2% (37.7–39.3 GHz), respectively.

Based on the relation between these refractive indices and wavelengths of antennas, a patch antenna with a Lorentz-dispersive material substrate simultaneously operates at two distinct frequencies with a single electrical size. This phenomenon offers the possibility of generating single-mode radiation over two frequency bands for antenna designs.

The proposed antenna is kept inside a flat device and simulated in a human head model.

First, the principle of decoupling between antennas is explained through the field analysis. It demonstrates that the essence of the decoupling of loaded metal structures is that the field is transferred between the antenna and the metal structure, with the metal structure acting as a resonator. The isolation of the antenna array generates a decoupling null when the resonator resonates with the excited antenna. Moreover, these resonators can independently control the corresponding decoupling nulls on the isolation. Therefore, broadband decoupling in the antenna array can be achieved by introducing multiple resonators within the operating frequency band of the antenna. The design method of the decoupling structure in the antenna array is also elucidated in this article, which provides significant computational resource savings. Finally, three examples are designed and tested to verify the proposed method.

However, the analog backscattered signal contains the coupling effects between the antenna’s nearby environment and the unknown measurement setup, such as mutual distance and orientation between the read/write device (RWD) and sensor tags, and line-of-sight obstruction, which affects measurement accuracy. This article proposes an optimal power-oriented setup-independent technique that utilizes commercially self-tuning RFID tags to extract the environment in the vicinity of the antenna, independent of the measurement setup. The concept is based on an observation that the level of the radiated power of the RWD and the received power of the self-tuning RFID IC are linearly regressed. The condition of the environment is identified by the self-tuned value from the RFID chip under an optimal chip impedance. In the offline state, the optimal received power level is determined to maximize the pairwise Euclidean distance of the tuned values of the environment state near the tag. The radiated power level of the RWD is adjusted linearly to implement the sensing at the optimal power level. A water-filling sensor tag operated with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes is demonstrated. Experiments show that the proposed system provides accurate sensing information under different measurement setups. The RFID tags can also be used in installations with heterogeneous environments.

Here, we numerically and experimentally demonstrated two types of waveform-selective microwave metasurface absorbers (MMAs) with a single square-patch structure and a lumped nonlinear circuit. Our MMAs were designed to preferentially absorb signals at the same frequencies, including a higher-order mode. The proposed capacitor-type MMA was comprised of a single square-patch structure connected with a diode bridge containing a capacitor paired with a resistor in parallel, which could effectively absorb short pulses at two distinct frequencies. Similarly, the proposed inductor-type MMA was comprised of the same square-patch structure, except for the internal circuit replaced with an inductor paired with a resistor in series, which could effectively absorb continuous waves (CWs) at the same two frequencies. The effects of the parameters of lumped circuit components (resistor, capacitor, and inductor) and geometrical parameters on the waveform-selective absorptance of these two types of MMAs for normal incident short pulses and CWs were systemically studied. Both the simulation and experimental results showed selective absorption for specific waveforms at the same two frequencies, including a high-order mode.

By validating different load-impedance densities perpendicular to the two incident polarization directions, the DPMGs can achieve energy distributions between multiple propagating diffraction orders in two planes. To validate the proposed design, two proof-of-concept MG samples are fabricated and tested, and the experimental results are found to be consistent with the simulated ones. Under orthogonal polarized incidences, we validate a first scenario where the beam is reflected in the +1st diffracted order in both the planes. Then, a second scenario is considered, where beam-splitting between +1st and −1st diffracted orders in one plane and reflection in the +1st order in the other plane are realized.

Accurate characterization of the dielectric properties of LCs is crucial for designing and optimizing reconfigurable microwave components. In this article, a method for characterizing the dielectric properties of LCs is proposed based on epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterials. The measurement device is first designed using a waveguide-based ENZ structure. When LC-materials under tests (MUTs) are filled into the coupling tunnel, the strong electromagnetic intensity within ENZ metamaterials is fully utilized to sensitively detect the transmission response. In addition, biased circuits and preconditioned alignments are also designed and integrated to extract complex dielectric permittivities of anisotropic materials. Particularly, due to the metallic structure of the measurement device, a temperature control system consisting of a sensor and heating device can effectively and precisely control LC-MUTs’ temperature so that dielectric responses of LC-MUTs under different temperatures can be obtained. On this basis, according to the measured transmission parameters, the perturbation method is used to calculate complex dielectric permittivities of LC-MUTs. A prototype is fabricated and tested to verify the method. Complex dielectric permittivities of two LC-MUTs are extracted at 1.9 GHz, which verifies the effectiveness of the method. Note that the dielectric properties of a powder sample are also investigated using the same device, demonstrating the universality of this method.

The focus is on improving the computational efficiency to offer better service for problems involving large-scale BoRs. Computational electromagnetics for the radiation and scattering problems of BoRs is one of the typical problems that is widely used in electromagnetic engineering. The method of moment (MoM) is an effective numerical method to solve the problems of BoR. In order to improve the computational efficiency, many fast algorithms based on the MoM have been proposed. The computations involving the Green’s function are important in the MoM since it consumes a dominating part of the computational sources. Either the modal Green’s function (MGF) or the PGF is required to be evaluated in BoR-MoM. The methods based on MGF are invested and used more widely than PGF. However, for a large-scale problem, the evaluations of MGF require an excessive number of recurrences to avoid significant loss of precision, or the forward and backward recurrences should incorporate with each other to keep the algorithms stable. The integration of PGF can be obtained in closed-form with respect to the length of generatrix  $t$  based on Taylor expansion to get rid of the heavy computations of recurrences. The lack of research studies on PGF is mainly because it requires the distance between two adjacent discrete points on the generatrix to be less than (or equal to) a tenth of the wavelength of the incident field. In this article, the spectral accuracy for the computation of PGF is achieved based on high order Taylor expansions. The restriction of “less than (or equal to) a tenth of the wavelength of the incident field” is overcome.

In order to precisely locate multiple harmful R-PIM sources, we develop a novel imaging method called the cascaded time-reversal multiple signals classification (CTR-MUSIC). This method multiplies a group of time-reversal multiple signals classification (TR-MUSIC) pseudo-spectra together to form the new pseudo-spectrum. The cascaded multiplication highly brightens the pseudo-spectrum peaks to easily identify the positions of the R-PIM sources and suppresses the remained pseudo-spectrum approximately to 0. By combining the multiple-static data matrices (MDMs) optimized by the weak-correlation filter (WCF), the proposed method exhibits a good ability in removing the redundant frequency information. The imaging computational complexity, positioning error, and positioning resolution of CTR-MUSIC are analyzed by numerical simulations. Compared with the existing ultra-wideband TR-MUSIC (UWB-TR-MUSIC), the results show that the proposed method improves the positioning accuracy, reduces computation consumption several times, and decreases the number of detecting antennas required for the same positioning accuracy. Experimentally, the R-PIM source is located with the positioning error of 0.04 wavelength at the signal central frequency of 1.7 GHz that proves the feasibility of positioning R-PIM source using the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3309372","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171082); Key Laboratory Fund Project of National Defense Science and Technology(grant numbers:6142605190102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10238436","Cascaded time-reversal-multiple signals classification (TR-MUSIC);multiple signals classification;passive intermodulation (PIM);weak-correlation filter (WCF)","Antenna arrays;Imaging;Multiple signal classification;Arrays;Pattern classification;Signal resolution;Scattering","","7","","36","IEEE","1 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To highlight this fundamental result, we have introduced an original metric called the “minimum achievable  $K$ -factor” derived from the  $K$ -factor, the one which assesses the ratio between the stirred and the unstirred energy within a reverberation chamber (RC). When comparing with the results obtained in a classic RC, it is shown that the amount of unstirred energy is significantly reduced in our VIRC, which can benefit to numerous RC applications. Moreover, the presence of unstirred paths is shown to be fully canceled above 7 GHz; the  $K$ -factor being similar to the minimum achievable  $K$ -factor.

In this article, we investigate a method to reduce the number of measurement nodes in RF imaging so that it is more suitable for integration with wireless communication. The approach is to exploit antenna-pattern diversity so that each node can collect multiple independent measurements from the same measurement location, thereby decreasing the number of measurement nodes required. Furthermore, we formulate pattern diversity for RF imaging using the recently developed extended Rytov approximation (xRA), which has been demonstrated to provide remarkable RF reconstruction accuracy. The advantage of utilizing xRA is that it allows us to utilize the metric of sensing capacity to straightforwardly quantify the potential of various pattern diversity configurations. Using the sensing capacity metric, we are able to identify configurations where the number of measurement nodes can be reduced by at least a factor of 2. Simulation results are provided to verify the RF imaging approach with reduced measurement nodes, which demonstrates the potential of using pattern diversity.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3310200","Hong Kong Grants Council Collaborative Research Fund (CRF)(grant numbers:C6012-20G); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021B1515120029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10241308","Extended Rytov approximation (xRA);inverse scattering;pattern diversity;radio frequency (RF) imaging;radio tomographic imaging (RTI);Rytov approximation (RA)","Imaging;Antenna measurements;Radio frequency;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Image reconstruction;Wireless communication","","7","","50","IEEE","5 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, these methods typically provide a single estimate of the permittivity pattern, which may be inadequate or misleading due to noise and the ill-posedness of the problem. In this article, we propose a data-driven framework for inverse scattering based on deep generative models (DGMs). Our approach learns a low-dimensional manifold as a regularizer for recovering target permittivities. Unlike supervised methods that necessitate both scattered fields and target permittivities, our method only requires the target permittivities for training; it can then be used with any experimental setup. We also introduce a Bayesian framework for approximating the posterior distribution of the target permittivity, enabling multiple estimates and uncertainty quantification (UQ). Extensive experiments with synthetic and experimental data demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional iterative solvers, particularly for strong scatterers, while achieving comparable reconstruction quality to the state-of-the-art supervised learning methods such as the U-Net.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3312818","European Research Council Starting(grant numbers:852821–SWING); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10250175","Convolutional neural networks;deep learning;unsupervised learning;inverse problems","Inverse problems;Permittivity;Scattering;Training;Iterative methods;Image reconstruction;Generators","","6","","69","CCBY","12 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this deficiency, this article presents an adaptive alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based method on the basis of the state-of-the-art MIMO-SAR fast image-solving model. Different from the traditional ADMM, the proposed algorithm avoids the multiplication and inversion of a large-scale sensing matrix, and the computation is significantly reduced. In addition, adaptive weighting is introduced to adjust the intensity of the  ${\ell _{1}}$  regularization item, with the objective of mitigating the loss in imaging accuracy caused by the state-of-the-art fast algorithm. On this foundation, considering the sensitivity of the optimized regularization coefficient to different targets and MIMO array configurations, an efficient optimized regularization coefficient searching method is developed, which greatly enhances the accomplishment of high-quality target image reconstruction in different scenarios as quickly as possible.

The ATW is pattern-free, meaning that the same windows can be excited without being affected by polarization. The left edge of ATW is controlled by the refractive index of the PC dielectrics, while the right one can be adjusted by the temperature, and the two edges can be independently regulated. ENZ edge state maintains linear variation in both frequency and angle domains, which provides the possibility for the sensing design in two freedoms. Frequency-domain detection can be used for a large measurement range while angle-domain detection is equipped with extremely high sensitivity. In addition, the proposed structure has the capability of multivariable sensing to measure different physical quantities.

The resulting wideband near-field conditions challenge channel characterization, since most traditional algorithms were proposed under narrowband far-field assumptions and hence fail to work properly. The frequency-invariant beamformer (FIBF) based on the uniform circular array (UCA) is promising for wideband 3-D near-field mmWave channel characterization, due to its capability to achieve the invariant beam pattern with respect to the frequency, elevation angle, and distance. However, this work finds out that the FIBF with existing phase mode selection would suffer from performance deterioration in practical 3-D near-field scenarios, which is overlooked in the literature. Suitable guidance for the generic application of the FIBF is still missing. In this work, we first demonstrate how the FIBF performance is deteriorated by improper phase mode selection through both simulation and theoretical derivation. Then, a novel and unified phase mode-selection guideline is proposed to ensure the robustness of the FIBF in various mmWave scenarios, that is, narrow/wide-band 2-D/3-D far/near-field scenarios, through theoretical analysis and a two-stage brute-force method. Finally, a numerical simulation and three wideband channel measurements with different parameter settings, that is, frequencies (28 and 15 GHz) and UCA radii (0.5 and 0.24 m), are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the guideline, where excellent estimation results are achieved. Our proposed phase mode-selection guidance will be valuable for UCA-based FIBF design for accurate and robust mmWave channel characterization.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3316791","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:92167202); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61925102); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62031019); National Natural Science Foundations of China(grant numbers:62201087); BUPT-CMCC Joint Innovation Center; BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation(grant numbers:CX2022202); Startup Research Fund of Southeast University(grant numbers:RF1028623309); European Partnership on Metrology Project MEWS(grant numbers:21NRM03); 6G-SHINE Project; European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Program; Participating States; Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU); 6G-SHINE Project within the European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:101095738); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10262256","Frequency-invariant beamformer (FIBF);mode selection;phase mode excitation;uniform circular array (UCA);wideband near-field millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel characterization","Millimeter wave communication;Three-dimensional displays;Antenna arrays;Wideband;Guidelines;Broadband antennas;Estimation","","13","","32","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Resorting to mathematical rigorous parameter tuning methods is a matter of practical necessity as interactive techniques (e.g., parameter sweeping) that are no longer adequate when handling several performance figures over multidimensional parameter spaces. The most common design scenarios involve local tuning since decent initial designs are often rendered at the early phases of the design process. Notwithstanding, antenna optimization is usually executed using full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation tools, inevitably requiring a considerable amount of computational resources. This article introduces a novel technique for expedited gradient-based antenna optimization with numerical derivatives. The two major acceleration mechanisms, both of which exploit the problem-specific knowledge carried by the antenna characteristics, include the response feature methodology and sparse sensitivity updates restricted to selected principal vectors. The former permits flattening the landscape of the objective function, whereas the latter effectively reduces the problem dimensionality to dimensions that have the most significant effect on antenna characteristics, which are established using an automated decision-making procedure. Our methodology is applied to optimize three antenna structures. Comparisons with several benchmark procedures indicate that the relevance of the adopted mechanisms and considerable computational savings that can be achieved. The average savings amount to 50% over conventional trust-region (TR) gradient search, and slightly lower, yet still significant, over accelerated versions thereof.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3312582","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:206606); National Science Centre of Poland(grant numbers:2020/37/B/ST7/01448); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10247213","Antenna design;automated decision making;gradient-based search;optimization;response features;simulation-driven design","Antennas;Optimization;Tuning;Sensitivity;Task analysis;Reflection;Reflector antennas","","7","","70","IEEE","11 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the perturbation of the slot, the SIW cavity is able to generate two resonant modes in the passband and simultaneously a radiation null at the lower bandedge. The via-loaded patch can generate an additional resonant mode to increase the operating bandwidth and further enhance the in-band gain of the antenna. In addition, the parasitic strip can offer the fourth resonance in the passband and, in the meantime, generate another radiation null at the upper bandedge due to its interaction with the rectangular patches. Consequently, a quasi-elliptic bandpass filtering response is achieved, along with enhanced impedance bandwidth and boresight gain. For demonstration, a prototype operating in the 5G mm-wave band is fabricated and measured.

To flatten the feeding surface of Luneburg lens (LL) while maintaining the wide-angle scanning capability, three effective measures have been taken. First, the focal points of LL are shifted to the interior to obtain GL ( ${f}$  = aR,  $0 < {a} < 1$ ) by utilizing Hamiltonian optics, and then the GL is truncated through the interior focal circle at  ${t}$  = bR ( ${b} < {a}$ ) to provide a focal surface with a larger radius of curvature. Second, the feeds are arranged on two sides of the focal surface to reduce the distance variation between the feeds and focal surface, thus reducing the gain fluctuation in the wide-scanning range. Third, two metal posts are introduced near the edge feeds to perturb the electric field in the vicinity, further enhancing the gain of edge beams. Consequently, a truncated GL with stable wide-angle beam-scanning performance is achieved, and simultaneously its permittivity features a narrow range and a regular distribution profile which is easy to implement. Moreover, to facilitate the process of the GL, its desired permittivity is synthesized using dielectric-post cells of different sizes and complementary air-hole cells of the same material. For validation, a truncated 2-D GL with a thickness of 4.5 mm and a diameter of 65 mm is processed using 3-D printing technology, and tested with nine feeding patch antenna elements that are linearly arranged on a planar surface.

However, if the TTA is designed, the fewer metal and dielectric layers, the more advantageous it is in terms of optical transparency (OT). Therefore, only a single glass layer was chosen to design a TTA with high OT. The novel analysis technique was applied to obtain the theoretical transmission response of the single substrate unit cell (UC) and to obtain impedance information to quickly design UCs by combining circuit analysis. Then, the aperture efficiency was increased using two methods: 1) two types of double resonance UCs were combined and 2) oblique incidence on the UCs on the edge of TA aperture was considered.

Finally, a dual-polarized array antenna operated at 24.0 GHz is fabricated and tested for verification. The measurements demonstrate and validate that both the desired high-gain VP and HP radiation patters are achieved at broadside.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3304057","National Natural Science Foundation of China through General Program(grant numbers:61971475); Science and Technology Development Fund of Macao through FDCT Research(grant numbers:0080/2021/A2,0085/2020/AMJ); University of Macau under Special Grant(grant numbers:CPG2023-00020-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10220118","Automotive application;dual-polarized;leaky-wave antenna;overlapped radiation aperture","Radar antennas;Antennas;Antenna arrays;Microstrip;Radar;Microstrip antenna arrays;Microstrip antennas","","4","","32","IEEE","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the dielectric waveguide model (DWM), new solution with a low-profile feature (height-to-radius ratio = 0.17) is found. For the demonstration, a low-profile tri-polarized cylindrical DRA is developed for WLAN 5.8-GHz application, which is fed by four notched slots of nearly a “O” shape. Two sets of slot pairs excite the  ${\text{HEM}}_{\mathrm {13\delta }}^{\mathrm {x}}$  and  ${\text{HEM}}_{\mathrm {13\delta }}^{\mathrm {y}}$  modes, which generate the broadside radiation patterns with  $y$ - and  $x$ -polarization, respectively. As four slots have in-phase and equal-amplitude inputs, the  ${\text{TM}}_{\mathrm {02\delta }}$  mode of the cylindrical DRA can be activated, which produces the omnidirectional radiation pattern with vertical polarization. The result shows that the proposed tri-polarized cylindrical DRA can provide a height of  $0.1\lambda _{\mathrm {o}}$ , which is a new low among the reported tri-polarized DRAs.

When the relative permittivity of the substrate is close to one, the horizontal dipoles dominate, and the radiation in the horizontal directions is negligible. In contrast, when the relative permittivity is high, the radiation pattern of the antenna resembles the pattern of a loop placed perpendicularly to the ground plane. The developed models explain the gain reduction due to the presence of the dielectric of up to around 4.3 dB (compared with the antenna in a vacuum), which we have confirmed numerically. Another contribution of this communication is the derivation of a simple formula for the gain as a function of the substrate permittivity.

In this work, an adaptive mesh technique is introduced to realize the nonuniform distribution of mesh size, and the FPO method is adopted to obtain the scattered field from every element. The technique is adopted for two reasons. Firstly, the physical optics (PO) scattered fields mainly originate from high-frequency critical points, resulting in a nonuniform distribution of the PO integral on scatterers’ surfaces. Secondly, the fast variation of the PO integral depends on the gradient of the phase term, which is nonuniform on the surface. Therefore, the proposed adaptive mesh technique has the potential to use fewer patches than the standard Nyquist sampling rate in certain regions. The technique is based on a posteriori error estimation, which allows for adaptive refinement of the mesh. Finally, advantages of the technique in computational accuracy and efficiency are verified through several numerical examples. The proposed method satisfies accuracy requirements at all scattered angles and reduces the number of sampling points by one order of magnitude compared with a uniform mesh algorithm.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3309092","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62231007,62231021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10236998","Adaptive mesh technique;mesh number;Nyquist sampling theorem;physical optics method;quadric patch","Optical surface waves;Physical optics;Surface waves;Surface treatment;Mesh generation;Error analysis;Behavioral sciences","","1","","20","IEEE","31 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The symplectic FDTD $^{\mathrm {(4,4)}}$  method, which exhibits higher-order numerical accuracy in both temporal and spatial domains, is utilized as the basis for this algorithm. The primary objective of this research is to overcome the limitations imposed by the Courant–Friedrich–Levy (CFL) condition. To achieve this, the study leverages the SF technique to establish an enlarged CFL condition within the proposed SF-SFDTD $^{\mathrm {(4,4)}}$  algorithm. Additionally, a novel hybrid subgrid technique is introduced to accommodate arbitrary coarse/dense grid ratios within the simulation domain. Specifically, the standard FDTD $^{\mathrm {(2,2)}}$  method is employed in the coarse grid region, while the proposed SF-SFDTD $^{\mathrm {(4,4)}}$  method is applied to the dense grid region. This approach ensures that the entire simulation can employ the same time increment determined by the stability condition of the coarse grid, owing to the highly stable characteristic of the SF-SFDTD $^{\mathrm {(4,4)}}$  method. To confirm the accuracy and advantages of the proposed SF-SFDTD $^{\mathrm {(4,4)}}$  algorithm and its extended method of hybrid subgrid technique, some numerical examples are carried out. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm in terms of both efficiency and memory requirement.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3304984","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201003,62271004,62231003,U20A20164,62301001); Anhui Province Key Research and Development Plane(grant numbers:2023z04020018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10224842","Spatial filtering (SF);subgrid technique;symplectic finite-difference time-domain method (SFDTD)","Standards;Finite difference methods;Numerical stability;Dispersion;Three-dimensional displays;Power system stability;Time-domain analysis","","4","","9","IEEE","18 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve the ISPs with limited aperture, an unrolling algorithm of subspace-based optimization method under physical contraction integral equation subspace optimization method (CIE-SOM), named CIE-SOM-NET, is proposed. The CIE model reduces nonlinearity, enabling CIE-SOM-NET to achieve better results in addressing regression problems. The proposed algorithm is composed of several submodules, and each submodule is constructed with a small convolutional neural network (CNN) and an operator of least square method, which are utilized to update the induced current and the modified contrast function, respectively. In addition, a weighted loss function, which is composed of the consistency function of the induced current, the scattered field, and the relative permittivity, is defined to constrain the training process in the physical CIE model. Compared to traditional iterative inversion methods, the proposed CIE-SOM-NET exhibits several merits in terms of imaging accuracy and computational cost. The proposed method also achieves better stability and robustness compared to the initial SOM-NET. Several numerical examples validate that the proposed CIE-SOM-NET has excellent inversion performance in the case of limited aperture.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3305834","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62293493,61971174); Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Anhui(grant numbers:2108085MF201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10225705","Convolutional neural network (CNN);inverse scattering problems (ISPs);limited aperture;weighted loss function","Mathematical models;Integral equations;Apertures;Permittivity;Image reconstruction;Neural networks;Inverse problems","","5","","27","IEEE","21 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method is capable of reconstructing the 3-D dielectric relaxation model using measured data acquired at multiple transmit frequencies. A least-squares optimization using the conjugate gradient method with Tikhonov regularization is applied at each VBIM step to relax the memory requirements. For evaluating the algorithm performance, two experiments are conducted with our newly designed MWI system, and image reconstruction is performed under black-box conditions with no a priori information. The phantom models in these experiments are: 1) a single ping-pong ball filled with 75% isopropyl–25% water mixture submerged into a plastic cup filled with 90% isopropyl–10% water mixture and 2) a coplanar distributed object consisting of five ping-pong balls filled with water at the same vertical level.

Each element is enclosed by an equivalence surface (ES), and the unknowns on the element can be transferred onto the ES using the equivalence principle algorithm (EPA). The challenge arises when the ES intercept the current carrying conductor, which is hard to evaluate numerically using traditional Rao–Wilton–Glisson (RWG) basis. In this communication, a new method based on grid-robust higher order vector basis (GRHOVB) function is proposed to deal with this challenge. To reduce model order further, the characteristic basis functions (CBFs) based on  $3\times3$  array are constructed on the ESs, which can analyze the strong coupling of connected elements. The proposed method is also accelerated by multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) and sparse approximate inverse (SAI) preconditioner to solve large periodic arrays with thousands of connected elements. Numerical examples are given to show the significant advantages of the proposed method compared with commercial solver.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3314530","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071263,61934006); Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo(grant numbers:202003N4150); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254492","Basis functions;electromagnetic scattering;equivalence theorem;fast solvers;integral equations;periodic structures","Interpolation;Integral equations;Microstrip;Green's function methods;Electromagnetic scattering;Boundary conditions;Transmission line matrix methods","","3","","26","IEEE","18 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
