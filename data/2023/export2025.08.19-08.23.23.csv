Therefore, a contactless method to estimate the efficiency of ESAs and IAs is necessary. This article proposes a novel method to estimate antenna efficiency contactlessly using a reverberation chamber (RC): the contactless efficiency method (CEM). In the CEM, we combine the two-antenna method (TAM) with the contactless characterization method (CCM), to estimate the  ${S}$ -parameters contactlessly. To validate the results, the CEM measurements are compared to the measurements of the widely used TAM and for both methods, an uncertainty analysis is performed. Results show a good agreement in the 95% confidence interval between the CEM and the existing connectorized method for both the total antenna efficiency and the radiation antenna efficiency. The uncertainty of the CEM with a 95% confidence level is below 6% for the whole 0.55–1.05-GHz frequency band.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3253216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066262","Antenna efficiency;contactless characterization method (CCM);contactless efficiency method (CEM);reverberation chamber (RC);wireless testing","Antenna measurements;Antennas;Contacts;Scattering parameters;Uncertainty;Transmitting antennas;Reverberation chambers","","2","","51","IEEE","10 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They support orthogonally polarized surface-wave modes with the same phase velocity in the principal direction of propagation. The isofrequency dispersion curves of these modes are hyperbolas, and therefore, these metasurfaces (MTSs) fall in the category of hyperbolic MTSs. It is shown here that the hyperbolas may degenerate in some cases into almost straight lines, which implies that the velocity of energy transport is constantly directed along the complementary strips at any frequency and for any possible phasing orthogonal to the strips. In this circumstance, the SCM can be conveniently used to design dual-polarized leaky-wave antennas by modulating the impedances of the complementary strips. Each strip behaves as a channel, which can be independently fed with the desired phase and amplitude. We demonstrate here that these antennas exhibit a strong decoupling between both co-polar and cross-polar channels, even when the distance between strips is electrically small. This increases the performance of the antenna, especially in azimuthal beam scanning. A prototype at 2.6 GHz has been constructed and successfully measured confirming the theoretical conjectures.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3244688","Huawei Technologies Company Ltd., within the Joint Antenna Innovation Laboratory between Huawei and the Department of Information Engineering and Mathematics, University of Siena; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10048771","Antennas;Babinet principle;leaky-waves (LWs);metasurfaces (MTSs);phased array;self-complementarity","Metasurfaces;Dispersion;Strips;Antennas;Impedance;Boundary conditions;Surface impedance","","3","","54","IEEE","17 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The desired radiation patterns (DRPs) are taken as the known information to reconstruct the permittivity distribution of the dielectric-type superstrate within a certain region. Based on the DRPs, the scattering fields in the far-zone can be assumed. Therefore, according to the electromagnetic inverse scattering method, the parameters of the dielectric-type superstrate can be reconstructed. To validate the proposed method, for simplicity, three shaped-beams are considered in the 2-D simulation first. Then, the reconstructed 2-D dielectric-type superstrates are directly extended to 3-D for applications. The results of the 2-D and 3-D simulations are in good agreement with each other. Good shaped-beam radiation patterns are obtained as expected. In addition, from the reconstructed superstrate, it can be concluded that the inverse design method without any prior knowledge is well beyond the ability of traditional forward design methods. Furthermore, unlike deep learning which requires datasets for training, the proposed method does not have this process, so it is also efficient.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3242353","Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2021ZYD0040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041835","Beamforming;Born iterative method;inverse design;inverse scattering method;shaped-beam radiation pattern;superstrate","Antenna radiation patterns;Inverse problems;Permittivity;Brain modeling;Antenna arrays;Three-dimensional displays;Optimization","","3","","28","IEEE","9 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first and second modes of the half-width microstrip line (HWMSL) are investigated and it is found that these two modes can be employed to design a dual-frequency HPO bidirectional leaky-wave antenna (Bi-LWA). Moreover, it is revealed that the first mode would be unexpectedly excited at the operation frequency of the second mode ( $f_{2}$ ). Therefore, shorting pins are periodically loaded underneath the HWMSL, so as to create a stopband for the first mode at  $f_{2}$ . With resort to the transmission line model of this pin-loaded HWMSL, the lower and upper cut-off frequencies of the stopband are explicitly derived. Under the guidance of these formulas, one can effectively control the position of the stopband, so as to suppress the undesired mode at maximum. The internal electric fields of a uniform and a pin-loaded HWMSL Bi-LWA are extracted, illustrating that the first mode component has been efficiently reduced at  $f_{2}$ .

The frequency ratio between the two bands is more than 4. Because of the contradiction between large element size in the Sub-6 band and narrow element spacing in the mmW band, it is hard to design one antenna array to be used in both of the two carrier frequency bands, especially for a miniaturized communication system. In this article, a novel dual-band planar antenna array is proposed to solve the contradiction by using recombining technology.

It is an integration of a textile patch antenna and a highly efficient rectifier on a small PCB substrate, where the feeding aperture of the antenna is significantly miniaturized by exploiting an LC loading technique to have an effective integration with the rectifier. The feeding-rectifying circuitry is attached to the back of the antenna by normal sewing threads. The essential components are soldered on the small rigid PCB for a robust connection. The size of the rectenna is  $0.817\times 0.817\,\,\lambda _{0}^{2}$  while the rigid substrate area for the feeding-rectifying circuitry is only  $0.278\times 0.147\,\,\lambda _{0}^{2}$  ( $3.4\times1.8$  cm) at 2.45 GHz. The intrinsic dielectric/conduction loss of textile feedlines, the loss of antenna-to-rectifier interconnectors, the loss of soldering or gluing on textiles, and the loss due to body absorption from typical large feeding slots are constitutively reduced. The soldering points and the consequent hard-to-be-characterized parasitic effects on textiles are avoided. The proposed integration approach reduces the cost and eases the rectenna design, fabrication, and integration. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the rectifier reaches up to 39.5% at −20 dBm input power level whilst the experimental rectenna prototype achieves the state-of-the-art PCE of 41% at an extremely low incident power density of  $0.4~\mu \text{W}$ /cm2.

Its dual-band aperture-shared structure is fed by two groups of independent feed networks, from the side and the bottom, using the quasi-planar coaxial waveguide line (QCWL) and the hollow-waveguide (HW) feed structure, respectively. The Ku-band antenna and Ka-band antenna are carried out through the same quad-ridge waveguide aperture and have the same array spacing. Thus, the large element spacing at high-frequency band inevitably leads to high sidelobes. The parasitic elements are adopted to suppress the high sidelobes in the E-plane and H-plane, and the realized gain of the high-frequency antenna is increased accordingly. In addition, a 1/ $2\lambda $  short-circuited stub is designed in the QCWL-based feed network for isolation enhancement.

The QGA implemented in this work automates the design process and enables the antenna designer to generate static or reconfigurable miniaturized microstrip folded antenna topologies. The QGA is also implemented to generate a pixelation pattern within the antenna radiating surface to optimally tune the antenna operation for IoT communication needs as well as for Wi-Fi operation. In this article, we also present a QGA-optimized folded miniaturized antenna in both static and reconfigurable topologies. The reconfiguration is achieved through a single radio frequency (RF) micro-electro-mechanical switch (RF MEMS) whose location is optimized through the automated process. The automated design process achieves 87% antenna size reduction at 868 MHz compared to a typical patch antenna operating at the same frequency. As a result, the static and reconfigurable antenna prototypes achieve good radiation efficiencies in comparison to their miniature size with acceptable gains thus satisfying the IoT physical and operational constraints.

In this article, a new scheme for enhancing XPD of a ±45° dual-polarized dipole antenna pair, the most prevalent antenna element form for MIMO BS antenna arrays, is proposed and is applied to a dipole antenna array. The new scheme induces the required coherent currents on a pair of vertical monopoles from the feeding line.

The structure couples the signal from the feeding line and excites two opposite currents on the vertical monopoles, whose radiated fields effectively compensate the  $\theta $ -component of electric field in a wide scanning angle. The working principle of the scheme is elaborated in detail with a simplified analytic model.

The simulation of an ME antenna involves the nonlinear coupling of electrostatics, solid mechanics, and magnetic physics, making it difficult to model such devices. This article proposes a fully multifield coupled model for the ME antenna, in which the nonlinear magnetostrictive model is taken into account. The nonlinear magnetization is solved and then ac and dc simulations are performed by coupling different physics. The effects of magnetic bias and pre-stress on the converse ME (CME) coupling and near-field radiation are discussed for the first time, to regulate the performance of the ME antenna with fixed dimensions. The results indicate that the magnetic bias and pre-stress can change the resonance frequency, CME coefficient, and near-field radiation of the ME antenna. Particularly, it should be noted that pre-stress has the opposite effect in the low and high regions of the bias field. The near-field radiation is significantly enhanced by applying a proper magnetic bias or pre-stress. This simulation may facilitate the understanding of nonlinear CME behavior and provide a basis for designing nonlinear active and tunable ME antennae.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3252465","Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2022JM020); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYTS23024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064238","Converse ME (CME) coupling;magnetoelectric (ME) antenna;multifield coupled;near-field radiation","Magnetostriction;Magnetic resonance;Antennas;Magnetoacoustic effects;Magnetoelectric effects;Magnetomechanical effects;Mathematical models","","21","","38","IEEE","8 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The crisscross-shaped dipole antenna is fed by four L-shaped strips, and a photonic bandgap (PBG) cell is loaded in the middle of each arm of the LB antenna to achieve HB-induced current scattering suppression without affecting the LB antenna, so the distortion of radiation patterns from the cross-band scattering can be avoided. As the LB antenna employs a crisscross structure, the four rings and patches can be integrated together with the LB antenna on the same substrate, which not only helps to broaden the bandwidth but also acts as the array-antenna decoupling surface (ADS). With the codesign of LB antenna and ADS, no extra substrates are required for in-band decoupling.

The omnidirectional pattern is obtained by virtue of the parasitic monopole, whereas the broadside pattern can be obtained when the DRA and radiation mode of the feeding ring slot are excited.

A tightly coupled dipole with an etched slot is proposed as the element antenna, which has a low active input impedance in a wideband and a wide scanning range. Thus, a simple feed strategy without requiring additional external matching networks and baluns could be adopted for the designed scheme. To obtain a large polarization isolation, a capacitively loaded cross-shaped metallic wall (CSMW) is proposed. It is also helpful to improve the in-band matching by mitigating the bandwidth-limiting loop mode at lower frequencies and removing the undesirable common-mode resonance. As a demonstration, an array is designed with a 4.1:1 bandwidth (0.69–2.88 GHz) and an active VSWR < 3.4 while scanning up to ±45° in the E-, H-, and D-planes. Its polarization isolation is better than 45 dB at the broadside and 35 dB within most of the bandwidth when scanning to ±45° in the E-/H-planes. Its cross-polarization level is more than 51 dB at broadside and 40 dB in scanning up to ±45° in the E- and H-planes. A dual-polarized  $8 \times $  8 array prototype (64 ports per polarization) is manufactured and evaluated. Results from the experiment demonstrate good agreement between the measurement and design.

The proposed algorithm can be used to synthesize arbitrary antenna array patterns as per the reference pattern while complementing the constraints on the aperture length and the desired thinning levels. The hybrid algorithm provides a computationally efficient and deterministic technique for synthesizing LSAAs with low sidelobe level (SLL) and demonstrates a wide angular scanning with minimal loss in directivity and SLL over the scan volume.

To address the issue, we propose reverse thinking, i.e., low scattering performance precedes radiation performance, and present a universal and definite route to achieve low-RCS array antennas directly from metasurfaces rather than from antennas. A specific design method is carefully elaborated to illustrate this route. First, a low RCS metasurface is designed. Then an interdigital arrangement of the metasurface and proper feeding techniques are exploited to excite parts of the metasurface cells to produce efficient radiations. These partially excited cells play twofold roles as the radiating structures for array antenna and as part of scattering structures for the low-RCS property. As examples, 1-D and 2-D metasurface-based array antennas are elaborately designed and fabricated, in which good radiation performance and broadband low RCSs are achieved simultaneously. Both numerical simulations and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Different from the conventional phased arrays and reconfigurable antennas, the radiated electromagnetic (EM) wave can be flexibly controlled by simultaneously modulating its phase and polarization. To realize phase switching, a clever text 1 bit phase shifter (0°/180°) is introduced in the element design. The polarization states are controlled by integrating the switch-loaded feeding structure, and a compact 2 bit polarization tuner [0°-LP, 90°-LP, right-handed circular polarization (RHCP), and LHCP] is finally realized. Since every element can realize 1 bit phase and 2 bit polarization switching, the text far-field beams and polarization types of the array format can be arbitrarily modulated by designing the coding sequence. To verify the proposed working principle, a compact reconfigurable text metasurface-loaded DR element and a four-element digitally reconfigurable linear array are implemented, text respectively. The overlapped 10 dB impedance and 3 dB axial ratio bandwidths are 2.35–2.55 GHz (12.5%) and 2.42–2.48 GHz (2.4%), respectively, (covering 2.40 GHz WIFI/bluetooth (BT) band).

This article proposes a physical-method-driven deep-learning-based (PMDL-based) fast beam stabilization algorithm for antenna array deformation. First, we theoretically analyze the radiation pattern synthesis of the conformal array with the arbitrary surface to design the corresponding physical method, and we verify the accuracy of the method by the calculated and simulated results. Then, the deep neural network (DNN) driven by the physical method is designed integrated with the aforementioned radiation pattern synthesis, whose training process is given. Finally, a  $1\times16$  array antenna is taken as an example to verify the validity of the beam stabilization algorithm when the designed array is deformed. The simulated and measured results indicate that gain dropping and sidelobe level (SLL) rising are, respectively, less than 1.5 and 2 dB by applying the proposed PMDL-based fast beam stabilization when the array antenna is deformed within the range of  ${\mathrm {100}}^{\circ }$  of the normal vector of each array element, while the beam stabilization time is less than 1.0 ms (testing time).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3249348","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61871036); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1803200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10058151","Beam stabilization;conformal array antenna;deep learning (DL);deformed array antenna;physical method driven","Manganese;Antenna arrays;Deformation;Antenna radiation patterns;Phased arrays;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Wireless communication","","18","","39","IEEE","2 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A CP stacked microstrip patch antenna is used as the element radiator with a structural modification on the parasitic patch to minimize gain variation. Since the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of the element radiator is inherently narrow, sequential rotation is employed to yield a wide AR bandwidth while forming the  $2\times 2$  subarray, which is then used as a building block to construct the larger  $8\times 8$  phased array.

A beamforming network (BFN) is integrated within the stackup of the phased array that comprises a commercially available silicon beamforming chip. This facilitates beam steering through the independent control of the input amplitudes and phases of the individual element radiators.

This study proposes a time-domain calibration method based on the simultaneous perturbation (SP) algorithm. Two objective functions were established: power of the received signal at array output or combination of power and correlation coefficient between the signal at array output and a target signal. For both criteria, the convergence settings require only two measurements at each iteration. One advantage of the method is that the entire signal operation for calibration is performed in the time domain. This is achieved by resolving the effects of distortion on time delay of each channel, which accounts for both amplitude and phase distortions at different frequencies. Therefore, the proposed method significantly increased the calibration efficiency for ultrawideband antenna arrays. Since time delay coefficients for calibration associated with array elements were determined independently due to characteristics of the SP, the estimation accuracy of the method is tangential to the number of elements in the array and is mainly dependent on the convergence conditions. This gives the method an additional distinct advantage for calibrating large-scale antenna arrays with ultrawide bandwidth. An estimation accuracy of 99% on time delay adjustments has been achieved and demonstrated.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3255642","NSFC(grant numbers:62174091,62201294); Post-Doc International Exchange Programme(grant numbers:YJ20210098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071954","Aperture array;calibration;simultaneous perturbation (SP);stochastic approximation (SA);time domain","Calibration;Antenna arrays;Delay effects;Phased arrays;Finite element analysis;Convergence;Loss measurement","","1","","45","CCBY","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The irradiation of a target area with OAM beams with different modes has been proven to be a feasible solution to improve the azimuthal resolution of the target. This article is the first to propose and validate novel spatiotemporal OAM beams generated by a uniform circular frequency diverse array (UC-FDA). Unlike the conventional uniform circular array (UCA), signals with frequency intervals need to be fed to the antennas in the UC-FDA structure. The mode of the spatiotemporal OAM beam can be switched automatically with spatial transmission, which enhances the flexibility of mode switching and reduces the switching time. The evolution characteristics of the OAM beam are fully demonstrated. Meanwhile, the intrinsic spatiotemporal evolution rules and influence parameters are analyzed and summarized. Furthermore, an optimized dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithm is proposed and used to implement mode detection. Finally, the spatiotemporal evolution of OAM beams is applied to a rudimentary exploration of radar imaging.

For the dual-polarized phased array antennas, the sources of cross-polarization leakage mainly include the polarization coupling from the feedlines and the radiators. Electric-dipole (E-dipole) and magnetic-dipole (M-dipole) are the most common radiators, which both suffer from the deteriorated polarization isolation when scanning in D-plane. Here, the hybrid M-/E-dipole is employed to overcome this issue. To avoid the serious cross-polarization leakage from the typical 1/4 wavelength feedline of E-dipole, the M-dipole is chosen to form the primary radiator with the typical 1/10 wavelength feedline. Therefore, the excited electric-/magnetic-current field vectors on the radiators and the feedlines can be significantly weakened. However, the low-profile M-dipole introduces the half-patch TM11 mode due to the coupling between the horizontal feedline and the ground plane. This parasitic radiation mode with the slant polarization seriously deteriorates the polarization isolation of the M-dipole. The shorted posts are employed to suppress the half-patch TM11 mode without breaking the M-dipole mode. Through that, the high polarization isolation characteristic of the dual-polarized M-dipole radiator is maintained. Then, the double-layer meta-surface (MS) is designed to act as the secondary radiator, i.e., the E-dipole. The MS also plays the role of the impedance matching layer. Based on these methods, the cross-pol. level better than {−66, −59, −52} dB in E-/H-planes and {−66, −28, −17} dB in D-plane when scanning to {broadside, 30°, 60°} is achieved, respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3256486","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807404,2021YFB2900402); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62031019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076403","Dual-polarized phased array antenna;fifth-generation (5G);low cross-polarization leakage;millimeter wave;wide scanning;wideband","Phased arrays;Dipole antennas;Wideband;5G mobile communication;Millimeter wave technology;Couplings;Millimeter wave communication","","12","","69","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, the geometric complexity is to be handled by modeling EM scatterer shapes as nonuniform rational basis spline (NURBS) surfaces, which enables an easy and intuitive shape control. Using the surfaces’ control points as optimization variables, the shape optimization problem is to be solved with the heuristic optimization strategy, which can effectively handle nonlinearity and the associated local optima. Specifically, the recently developed grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is employed. Although GWO can effectively avoid local optima and achieve quasi-optimal results, it requires repeated calls to time-consuming EM simulations. To solve this efficiency issue, a filter-enhanced version of GWO is proposed to reduce the times of calling EM simulations, and an efficient, adaptive remeshing method is proposed to accelerate the numerical analysis process within each EM simulation call. Altogether, they lead to a quasi-optimal and efficient method for optimizing EM scatterers.

Numerical results corroborate the presented theory and show the effectiveness of our approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3247896","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation)(grant numbers:SFB 1270/2-299150580); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054504","Broadband;electric field integral equation (EFIE);integral equations;loop star;loop tree;low frequency;multiply connected;near field (NF);quasi-Helmholtz projectors","Current density;Integral equations;Stars;Noise measurement;Electric fields;Topology;Testing","","10","","43","IEEE","28 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The boundary element method (BEM) can be an effective simulation tool for these problems because it allows modeling 3-D objects with only a surface mesh. However, existing BEM formulations can be restrictive because they make assumptions specific to particular applications. For example, capacitance extraction formulations usually assume a constant electric scalar potential on the surface of each conductor and cannot be used to model a flowing current, nor to extract the resistance. When modeling steady currents, many existing techniques do not address mathematical challenges such as the null space associated with the operators representing the internal region of a conductor. We propose a more general BEM framework based on the electric scalar potential for modeling conductive objects in various scenarios in a unified manner. Restrictive application-specific assumptions are not made, and the aforementioned operator null space is handled in an intuitive and rigorous manner.

The approach consists of two stages and has an efficient way in dealing with multiple constraints, including the array aperture, number of elements, and minimum spacing between adjacent elements. In the first step, a density-weighted method is implemented to generate a thinned array structure by introducing the weighted coefficient based on the distribution function of a uniform full array to the elements, which can reduce the time and improve the efficiency of the optimization of sparse matrices. On the basis of a density-weighted array, tent chaotic mapping is introduced to initialize the population, then the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is used to further optimize the location of each element of the array antenna to search for the global optimal solution. As a consequence, the proposed method exhibits improved flexibility with respect to other analytical techniques, and reduces the computational cost of the optimization algorithm.

Here, we determine the lower bounds of  $Q$  factors of small-size plasmonic and high-permittivity dielectric resonators, which are characterized by quasi-electrostatic and quasi-magnetostatic natural modes, respectively. We expand the induced current density field in the resonator in terms of these modes, leading to closed-form analytical expressions for the electric and magnetic polarizability tensors, whose largest eigenvalue is directly linked to the minimum  $Q$  factor. Our results also allow to determine in closed form the corresponding optimal current density field. In particular, when the resonator exhibits two orthogonal reflection symmetries, the minimum  $Q$  factor can be simply obtained from the  $Q$  factors of the single current modes with nonvanishing dipole moments aligned along the major axis of the resonator.

In the absence of enough experimental measurements, rain attenuation can be estimated by using physical models of radiowave scattering in raindrops combined with information about the raindrop size distributions (DSD). In this work, the characterization of rain attenuation in the 80–200 GHz frequency range is carried out from a large database of 12 years of experimental DSD gathered in Madrid, Spain. Rain attenuation is estimated for each collected minute of rain using two approaches: a first one based on the assumption of raindrops as spherical and the application of the Mie theory, and a second one that uses a non-spherical raindrop model and electromagnetic simulations and is consequently more realistic. The main results show that the currently used International Telecommunications Union-Radiocommunications Sector (ITU-R) model generally underestimates rain-specific attenuation; the influence of polarization becomes smaller and negligible as the frequency approaches 200 GHz; and rain-specific attenuation significantly varies due to the spread of the DSD.

Theoretical analysis and real experiments demonstrate that the inversion efficiency of CC-CSI has been improved dramatically in comparison to the strategies of LU decomposition and the Biconjugate gradient (Bicg) algorithm. Specifically, the inversion speed of the proposed fast CC-CSI algorithm is at least one order of magnitude higher than using the latter two approaches in 3-D inversion, while the memory requirement of the proposed algorithm is intermediary and acceptable.

The operating mechanism is analyzed with several parametric studies based on the momentum-matching principle, and a systematic design procedure for a practical EW absorber is concluded. Three samples made of indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films are designed, fabricated, and tested, and the experimental results agree well with the theoretical results. The maximum measured absorptance reaches up to 97%. Compared with conventional plane-wave absorbers with multilayer conductors, the proposed EW absorber only requires a single-layer conductor and has a distinct working mechanism, design principle, and application scenario. In the examples considered in this study, the samples can serve as the specific matching component for calibrating the RWG below the cutoff frequency.

The feasibility of using low-band channel information for coarse estimation of high-band beam directions strongly depends on the spatial congruence between the two frequency bands. In this work, we try to answer two related questions. First, how similar is the power angular spectrum (PAS) of propagation channels between two widely separated frequency bands? Then, what is the impact of practical antenna configurations on spatial channel similarity? We propose a beam directions-based metric to assess the power loss and the number of false directions if out-of-band spatial information is used instead of in- band information. This metric is more practical and useful than comparing the PASs directly.

Because the ITR results in a partly missing pulse signal, spectrum aliasing occurs and the target range profile is difficult to be obtained. Therefore, frequency domain filtering and sparse reconstruction are proposed to recover the target range profile. However, frequency domain filtering is ineffective when the wideband signal is utilized. The calculation of sparse reconstruction is complex and the reconstruction performance may be poor for some cases of ITR parameters. To solve this problem, the code-ITR (code-ITR) of the pulse signal is proposed in this article. First, the ITR sequences are coded according to the duty ratio of each sub-pulse.

This approach avoids the air gap introduced by the traditional split-block technology, and thus solves the problems of orthogonal-modes leakage and mode resonance caused by the waveguide discontinuity. Therefore, the proposed polarizer possesses the merits of broadband, resonance-free, high consistency of orthogonal modes, and low insertion loss (IL). In the polarizer measurement, a circular to rectangular waveguide converter is designed and fabricated. The measured IL of the polarizer is found to be around 0.28 dB in the frequency range of 198–260 GHz, and the in-band return loss is better than 15 dB.

In our system design, the RDA is developed by transmitting a stepped frequency linear frequency modulation waveform and delaying the received echo with a small time offset between adjacent receive antenna elements. In doing so, a range-angle-dependent beampattern is obtained in the joint transmit–receive spatial domain. A two-stage beamforming scheme, including the equivalent data-independent transmit beamforming and dimension-reduced data-dependent receive beamforming, is then proposed to mitigate mainlobe interferences. Furthermore, according to the adaptive array theory, by designing a transmit weight vector dependent on the interference steering vector, two beampattern synthesis algorithms are developed, respectively, based on the maximum gain and minimum deviation to adjust multiple responses of the transmit beampattern precisely. The mainlobe of the receive beampattern is also broadened with the use of the derivative constraint. By combining the devised transmit and receive weight vectors, a 2-D joint transmit–receive beampattern with a flat-top mainlobe and broadened nulls can be formed, where the interferences are mitigated against the direction-of-arrival (DOA) mismatch. Theoretical and practical analyses and parametric studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beampattern synthesis methods in mitigating mainlobe interferences.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3247916","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101402,61931016,62271386,62071344); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology (CAST)(grant numbers:2021QNRC001); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021TQ0261,2021M702547); SAST Innovation Fund(grant numbers:SAST2022-041); Science and Technology Innovation Team of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2022TD-38); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054556","Adaptive array theory;beampattern synthesis;direction-of-arrival (DOA) mismatch;joint transmit-receive spatial domain;mainlobe interferences;receive delay array (RDA)","Array signal processing;Interference;Frequency modulation;Delays;Delay effects;Adaptive arrays;Receiving antennas","","54","","41","IEEE","28 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Proper temporal control of the backscattered phase can cause the investigating radar to estimate the wrong range and velocity, thus cloaking the real position and trajectory of the scatterer. This deception method is exploited here theoretically for arbitrary Doppler tolerant waveforms and then tested experimentally on an example of the linear frequency modulated (LFM) radar, which is the most common waveform of that class used in practice. The method allows retaining radio silence with a semi-passive (battery-assisted) approach that can work well with time-dependent metasurfaces.

Placing an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) surface underneath the AoC not only isolates the antenna from the lossy substrate but also boosts its performance through in- phase reflection. Ideally, the AMC, which has a periodic structure, should be infinite in size, but practical chip sizes limit its dimensions. The gain of an AMC-backed AoC shows a positive correlation with the AMC lateral area. However, in the ultrathin stack-up of standard CMOS processes, the AMC cannot be irradiated uniformly by the antenna because of the physical illumination issue, so the AoC gain does not increase with the AMC area after the initial increase. To improve the illumination of the AMC by an AoC, this work introduces coupling enhancement structures (CESs) that employ the available metal layers of the stack-up. The proposed AMC-backed AoC with CES demonstrates a gain of 9.8 dBi and a radiation efficiency of 71% at 94 GHz, which are improvements of 4.3 dB in gain and 23% in radiation efficiency, respectively, compared to an AoC backed by a conventional AMC.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3239102","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Research Funding (KRF)(grant numbers:ORA-2022-5314); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10028749","Antenna-on-chip (AoC);artificial magnetic conductor (AMC);coupling enhancement structure (CES);effective illumination;system-on-chip","Antennas;Lighting;Gain;Substrates;Silicon;System-on-chip;Reflection","","7","","29","IEEE","27 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SIW cavity formed with sparse metalized posts is embedded in the square patch, and the impedance bandwidth can be broadened by merging the TM10 mode of the square patch, excited by the electromagnetic energy escaping from the sparse posts, with the TE210 mode in the SIW cavity through differential excitation.

The CSRRs, surrounding the differential excitation ports, are etched into the bottom surface of the SIW cavity, and a lower-edge radiation null is produced to further sharpen the roll-off rate. By adjusting the geometrical parameters of the SSIRs and CSRRs, the positions of the two radiation nulls can be independently controlled.

Initially, the traditional MPA under modes 1–4 is theoretically studied. This proves that the four modes maintain a high MC of approximately–2 dB. To address this issue, shorting pins 1 and 2 are inserted below the radiator, leading to a more than 12 dB MC reduction between the two ports along the  $x$ -axis. After that, the MC between the two ports along the  $y$ -axis is deeply studied. This proves that the electric field nulls of the MPA could be moved near unexcited ports and reduce the MC by combining modes 1 with 2 (or modes 3 with 4). Hence, shorting pin 3 is loaded for mode combination and low MC. In addition, shorting pin 4 is loaded to reshape the radiated fields in the upper band. Moreover, the impedance matching and the bandwidth are improved by cutting the ring slots. Finally, a four-port MPA is fabricated and tested.

However, both the magnitude and phase information are necessary to reconstruct the 3-D radiation pattern of the tested radiating system. The two scans technique allows for accurate phase retrievals from magnitude-only measurements. In this communication, the two concentric spheres setup is considered with a Gerchberg–Saxton (GS) algorithm as a phase retrieval procedure. These methods are known for their convergence problems, the price to pay for the easier, magnitude-only, measurements.

The design is composed of a specially engineered L-shaped driven dipole, a near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) crossed Egyptian axe dipole (EAD), and an NFRP inductive grid-array metasurface. The L-shaped driven dipole simultaneously excites two degenerate modes of the crossed-EAD with an intrinsic 90° phase shift to produce one AR pole. Similarly, it also effectively excites two orthogonal modes of the grid-array metasurface to generate the second AR pole. A wide AR bandwidth is achieved by pressing these two AR poles close together. The measured results agree well with their simulated ones. The measured impedance bandwidth, where  $\vert S_{11}\vert < -10$  dB, ranges from 1.28 to 1.73 GHz (29.9%) and the 3-dB AR bandwidth ranges from 1.35 to 1.66 GHz (20.5%).

Owing to these four different resonances, the CP reflection bandwidth is greatly improved and elaborately adjusted by controlling the coupling between the crossed dipoles.

A few equivalent boundary conditions (BCs) are able to replace thin structures with zero-thickness surfaces and avoid volumetric discretization. However, their near-field solutions suffer from loss of accuracy as the thickness increases, because the reduction of thin structures to zero-thickness surfaces changes the original problem. This work presents a mesh-splitting technique for the impedance transition BC (ITBC), which effectively eliminates the aforementioned error without additional number of unknowns. Under certain assumptions, the technique can be easily applied and yield much more accurate solutions than several other equivalent BCs; otherwise, it may be unfeasible or lead to marginal improvements. Moreover, the mesh-splitting ITBC is incorporated into the spectral-element spectral-integral (SESI) method for the modeling of doubly periodic problems including metasurfaces.

Modeling of the GPR system has a significant role in the successful estimation of subsurface media properties, imaging, and detection of buried object. A model should provide good accuracy and computational efficiency while taking care of numerous GPR scenarios. However, achieving accuracy and speed of computation is a difficult task. In this respect, analytical modelings are promising techniques to represent a specific GPR scenario. In this work, a simplified full wave model (FWM) for bi-static GPR has been developed to represent radar transceivers with layered media. The model has been derived from an existing FWM solution. The accuracy of the proposed model has been verified by comparing it with existing FWMs, and by laboratory experiments based on stepped frequency continuous wave (SFCW) GPR. The corresponding results show that the proposed bi-static model is as accurate as FWM and its computational efficiency is enormous in estimating the sub-surface media properties.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3241725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041853","Bi-static model;calibration;full wave model (FWM);Green’s function;ground penetrating radar (GPR);layered media;stepped frequency continuous wave (SFCW) radar","Computational modeling;Nonhomogeneous media;Mathematical models;Green's function methods;Numerical models;Ground penetrating radar;Transmitting antennas","","4","","25","IEEE","9 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
