In this work, we present a new design methodology for dual-band LWAs (Fabry–Pérot type). The proposed methodology is based on the use of a single partially reflective surface (PRS) that fulfills the resonant condition at two different frequencies. Consequently, a dual-band single-layer antenna can be designed. The potential of this methodology is demonstrated through two different designs of antennas showing also how control of the directivity is also possible. A prototype is manufactured and measured to validate the presented methodology and theoretical results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3195510","Spanish Government(grant numbers:TEC2016-79700-C2-2-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9976943","Directivity enhancement;dual-band antennas;Fabry–Pérot antenna;leaky-wave antennas (LWAs);metasurfaces (MTSs)","Dielectrics;Permittivity;Slabs;Leaky wave antennas;Dual band;Impedance;Metasurfaces","","4","","45","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, two individual identical slots are arranged in coupling to each other in a perpendicular position, thus acquiring a pair of orthogonal linear polarization (LP) with equal amplitude. Simultaneously, an inherent  $90^{\mathrm {\circ }}$  phase difference is naturally produced by the inductive coupling between two slot radiators. In order to clearly illustrate the evolution principle of this proposed CP realization method, the whole structure is in general modeled as an equivalent three-port network for efficient study. Based on these two achieved conditions, a CP slot antenna with one minimum AR point of 4.7% AR bandwidth (ARBW) is satisfactorily realized. After that, based on this proposed design concept, an additional slot is introduced to construct a new inductive coupling, thus facilitating two AR points under triple-mode resonance. With this arrangement, a wideband CP slot antenna with an improved ARBW of 14.1% is successfully implemented, which in turn validates the effectiveness and flexibility of this CP design approach. Finally, both the CP slot antenna element and the wideband CP antenna are implemented, fabricated, and tested. The measured results of the antenna prototypes are found in good agreement with the simulated results, thereby confirming the design concept.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3233445","National Natural Science Foundation of China under General Program(grant numbers:61971475); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund through FDCT Research(grant numbers:0085/2020/AMJ,0080/2021/A2); University of Macau(grant numbers:CPG2022-00008-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10012670","Circularly polarized;coupled slot radiators;equivalent three-port network;inductive coupling;wideband axial ratio (AR)","Slot antennas;Couplings;Broadband antennas;Wideband;Inductive coupling;Dielectric resonator antennas;Microwave antennas","","11","","49","IEEE","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Narrowband Passive RF Tags for Frequency-Selective Harmonic Doppler Radar Tracking","C. Hilton; J. A.

Harmonic RF tags receive an incident microwave signal and generate a retransmitted signal at a harmonic of the incident frequency, typically the second harmonic. Since environmental backscatter occurs at the fundamental frequency, the second harmonic can be easier to detect. Typical harmonic tags operate over a reasonably wide fractional bandwidth, and thus to detect multiple tags within the same field of view, additional circuitry must generally be added to the tag to differentiate the responses. We propose a different approach based on frequency selectivity implemented by the tag antenna. Based on narrowband split-ring printed antennas, the tags accept incident signals over a specified narrow fractional bandwidth, after which the second harmonic is generated by a diode and retransmitted with a standard dipole antenna. The narrowband filtering occurs at the fundamental frequency antenna, and thus with tags designed at adjacent narrowband frequency channels, no additional circuitry is necessary to differentiate multiple tags. Fabricated tags achieved fractional bandwidths below 0.5% at carrier frequencies below 2.5 GHz while maintaining gains above 2 dBi. The construction of the tag is simple and low-cost, requiring only a single component (a diode) on a printed antenna structure. We demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously measuring the time-varying harmonic Doppler signature of multiple tags in the field of view by experimentally verifying the frequency selectivity of tags in motion using a 2.4/4.8 GHz harmonic Doppler radar.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3220489","Procter and Gamble Company; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9947030","Harmonic radar;micro-Doppler;narrowband antennas;radio frequency (RF) tags","Harmonic analysis;Dipole antennas;Power harmonic filters;Radar antennas;Antenna measurements;Resonant frequency;Bandwidth","","10","","27","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the main part of the feed network, we found that the sidewall reflection of the parallel plate waveguide (PPW) is the major reason for the deterioration of the beam-scanning performance at large angles. Therefore, a hybrid feed network composed of PPW and substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) is proposed. Mechanical beam-scanning is realized by a planar parabolic reflector-based line source generator (LSG). To expand the beam-scanning range, an SIW delay line-based phase compensation structure is introduced after theoretically analyzing the phase deviation generated by the LSG. The CP radiation is realized by improved CP antenna elements with a wide 3 dB axial ratio (AR) beamwidth. These CP antenna elements are fed by a corporate-fed network to avoid the frequency-dependent squint beam. A K-band prototype of an  $8\times14$  array is fabricated and measured to verify the design. According to the measured results, the beam-scanning range of 0°–51° in elevation with the peak gain of 22.3 dBi is realized.

The proposed antenna was constructed from a metamaterial-based polarizer mounted above the aperture of a rectangular waveguide. The polarizer was oriented at 45° to E-plane of the waveguide. The proposed polarizer is composed of multiple metamaterial layers. The unit cell of the proposed polarizer consists of a single dielectric slab incorporating a series of rectangular split ring resonators that are printed on both sides of the slab. Impedance matching layers (IML) are introduced to enhance the axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth. The polarizer has a low profile in terms of electrical length (thickness of  $0.41 \lambda _{0}$ , where  $\lambda _{0}$  is the free-space wavelength at 10.5 GHz). A full-wave electromagnetic simulator was used to verify the anisotropic characteristics of the unit cell.

Therefore, the proposed antenna has the advantage of a simple structure.

Because the antennas are connected and fed in series in MTSAA, in-phase radiation of the antenna elements with properly tapered amplitude for achieving a broadside beam with a low sidelobe level (SLL) is challenging. Although the reported series-fed patch and comb-line arrays accomplished the goal, design equations for the optimum distances between antenna elements in the series-fed array do not guarantee in-phase radiation due to the mutual coupling in array structures. Therefore, optimization of the distances in the array using full-wave simulations is inevitable. In this article, we propose the first universal and non-iterative design equation that compensates for the phase offset generated in patch and comb-line MTSAAs and successfully found optimum distances for broadside beams with low SLLs without optimization. Finally, we fabricated both MTSAAs with ten elements operating at 76.5 GHz and demonstrated almost 13 dB boresight gain and low SLLs near −18 dB without a beam tilt.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3227751","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant; Korean Government Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)(grant numbers:2020R1C1C101209912); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9984181","Comb-line array;millimeter-wave antenna array;series-fed patch array;traveling-wave series-fed antenna array","Antennas;Microstrip antenna arrays;Phased arrays;Mutual coupling;Mathematical models;Delays;Couplings","","7","","22","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from linearly polarized (LP) patch arrays, a dual-feed structure is adopted for each element to enhance the CP performance. The dual-feed structures should be integrated into the DFN, and hence the coupling paths become very complicated. An orthogonal mode decomposition (OMD) method is established to analyze the coupling mechanism between the CP patch elements. Based on the OMD, a network model of the mutual coupling between the CP patch elements is established, which can be used to assist design of the DFN. To verify the decoupling effect, a prototype of a  $2\times $  2 CP patch array for a satellite navigation system is fabricated and measured. After applying the DFN, mutual coupling between all ports is reduced to below −33 dB at the center frequency of 1.26 GHz, and the decoupling effects reach 15–23 dB.

Thus, the proposed antenna topology is denoted as antenna-in-display (AiD). To fit the extremely narrow embedding conditions of the given DS (= $0.03 \lambda _{0}$  at 28 GHz), a new-shape coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed folded dipole antenna was devised and efficiently tailored in the DS area. The bottom side of the panel was modified to render the effect of a coplanar defected ground structure (CDGS) for antenna minimization, and a new asymmetrical antenna geometry was proposed for wideband impedance matching and broadside radiation pattern. Compared with conventional studies, the proposed antenna concept provides an improved gain resulting from the good conductive metal in DS, the complete display visibility, and touch sensor compatibility, whereas the previous antenna-on-display (AoD) approaches inherently suffer from the limited gain obtained at the expense of lower conductivity of the optically invisible antenna electrodes.

Moreover, to improve the gain and sidelobe level at high frequencies, the SSPP units in the quad-band antenna are tilted. Then, an SSPP structure consisting of a periodic array of metal strips is proposed. By adding two arrays of tilted I-shaped strip resonators to the quad-band antenna, the first two bandgaps are eliminated. The proposed antenna achieves a fractional bandwidth of 140.8% from 6.9 to 39.7 GHz. Minimum and maximum measured gains of 6.4 and 15.2 dBi are achieved at 6.9 and 38 GHz, respectively. The proposed antenna has a great potential for applications in imaging and wireless communication.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3227750","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271257); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9984188","I-shaped resonator (ISR);planar end-fire antenna;spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs);ultrawideband","Antennas;Gain;Bandwidth;High frequency;Dispersion;Dipole antennas;Electric fields","","11","","18","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with the traditional dual-polarized gap waveguide antenna array, this feeding-network of the proposed subarray exhibits only two layers (polarization separation layer and power divider layer). Two orthogonal polarizations are excited by two orthogonal modes of a cylindrical cavity. A high-order mode cavity acts as a 1 to 4 power divider. The proposed  $2\times $  2 subarray has an overall bandwidth of 24% ( $\vert S_{11}\vert < -10$  dB,  $\vert S_{21}\vert < -10$  dB and gain fluctuations within 3 dB) with a peak gain of 15.2 dBi. Although the overall bandwidth of the subarray is wide, the port isolation is low (about 15 dB) and the cross-polarization level is relatively high due to the polarization separation being realized on a one-layer structure. In the array design, a dual-polarized feeding network with high isolation above 40 dB is realized by using ridge gap waveguide and groove gap waveguide transmission lines. Since the feed network is designed symmetrically, the cross-polarization is also canceled out. The simulated cross-polarization ratio of the array is higher than 50 dB. Based on the new feeding network topologies, measured results demonstrate that the  $4\times $  4 array achieves an overall bandwidth of 22.8% ( $\vert S_{11}\vert < -10$  dB,  $\vert S_{21}\vert < -40$  dB and gain fluctuations within 3 dB) with a peak gain of 19.8 dBi.

The modulation produces multiple sideband frequency components. Polarization manipulation is another interesting application of FSSs, which can rotate the EM wave polarization by 90° upon reflection. In this article, for the first time the time modulation and polarization-rotation are used simultaneously in single structure as a countermeasure to Radar detection. Initially, a p-i-n diode-based, switchable polarization-rotating FSS that switches between co-polarized and cross-polarized reflection is designed. Then, an EM wave modulation scheme is planned where the polarization state of the FSS is switched using a periodic signal. When a linearly polarized EM wave of single frequency component is incident upon the surface, it is reflected back as two orthogonally polarized waves. Both the reflected waves have several sideband frequency components besides the incident frequency component. Two additional modulation scheme are also proposed where one of the co-polarized or the cross-polarized reflected wave is dominant. A prototype was prepared and its response was measured.

To improve radiation efficiency of TMAs, various evolutionary algorithms become very popular in sideband suppressions. Apparently, the sideband radiation levels highly depend on the performance of these evolutionary algorithms. To achieve robust sideband suppression through physical designs, a novel pseudorandom hybrid phase–amplitude modulation technique is proposed to distribute the sideband radiation power over a continuous spectrum, rather than only at discrete harmonic frequencies. Following the law of energy conservation, sideband levels (SBLs) in this case naturally become extremely low, which eliminates the difficulty arising in TMAs’ sideband suppressions. Moreover, the novel modulation technique allows the synthesis of scanning beams with ultralow sidelobe levels, and the corresponding time modulation sequences could be directly calculated from analytical formulations. Therefore, evolutionary optimization algorithms are not necessary in the proposed TMA design procedure, which facilitates the real-time on-board calculation with an field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board. As compared with traditional TMAs, the proposed TMA achieves ultralow SBLs ( $< -35.0$  dB) with much fewer time modulation statuses.

The concept is validated by simulation first, where a 1 bit 32  $\times32$  wirelessly reconfigurable microstrip RA is designed at 10 GHz with a beam-steering range of ±60° for sidelobe levels < −10 dB, marking a record of 1024 elements with a tri-layer configuration.

In this article, we devote a special effort to achieving high accuracy in electromagnetic simulations of MMWI scenarios. This complex task requires developing a suitable meshing procedure, which balances model fidelity and computational bottlenecks such as a large number of unknowns in the electromagnetic model. Thus, instead of a simple conversion from triangles to quads, we offer a technique that generates high-quality mesh (in terms of both simulation speed and geometrical accuracy) with controllable deviation from the initial model. In addition, we developed a strategy for self-convergence tests that prove the reliability of the simulation results in the MMWI framework. Moreover, an additional validity test has been proposed, based on the inverse scattering operator, commonly used in many microwave imaging algorithms.

Similar to expansions with electric and magnetic surface current densities, distributed expansions with Cartesian spherical harmonics (SHCs) or standard vector spherical harmonics (SHVs) are redundant when they are placed on Huygens’ surfaces. This redundancy is reduced by allowing only spherical harmonics, which can be excited by surface current density distributions in a specific plane, and by forming directive spherical harmonics. This results in a considerable reduction of the necessary number of unknowns for representing the sources and improved conditioning of the discretized integral equations. Inspired by the Huygens’ radiator concept, appropriate directive harmonics on the basis of SHCs and SHVs are derived, implemented, and compared in terms of their performances.

It is most common among CP patch antennas, cross-dipole antennas, and substrate-integrated waveguide antennas. Based on the equivalent circuit model, the analysis method builds a bridge between the reflection coefficient and excitation property. It is shown that the trace property of the reflection coefficient on the Smith Chart infers whether the antenna performs the best AR value and AR bandwidth. By locating impedance points and extracting circuit parameters, accurate circular polarization properties can be estimated. We also provide a numerical way, which is based on an optimization algorithm, to estimate the AR while considering the difference between the two equivalent antenna resonators. A verification program is compiled, and different CP antennas are simulated, fabricated, and analyzed. This study also illustrates the source of estimation errors and proves that the method reaches acceptable AR estimation without time-consuming microwave chamber measurement.

With proper configuration, this array radiates a field discontinuity which cancels out any scattering which occurs when the object is illuminated by an impinging electromagnetic wave. Unlike many other cloaking methods, an interior cloak can be completely constructed using conventional components while its active nature allows it to circumvent passivity-based constraints. This enables an interior cloak to hide an object of virtually any size, shape, and material composition as well as accommodate multiple frequencies and polarizations. Despite its potential, this approach has only been demonstrated on 2-D and quasi-2-D targets to date. As such, this article presents the first 3-D implementation of an interior cloak. Here, the design of a cloak array capable of hiding a conductive, circular cylinder in free space is first presented.

It is observed that in the presence of textile, a slow wave mode can be excited tangentially near the surface of human body. Clothing and the thin air between the clothing and the human body surface may attribute to the reduction of path loss at NLoS. Our findings show that the presence of different garment materials is linked to the variation of path loss in on-body radio channels.

This work proposes a new approach for measuring the dispersion curve of a spoof SPP TL by using experimental near-field data. A mathematical model is presented to describe the relation between the wavenumber  $k$  and the near-field data by considering the presence of reflected waves. The high efficiency and accuracy of this method are verified by the good agreement obtained between the measured dispersion curve and the eigenmode simulation result for a typical spoof SPP TL.

Although in many cases, it is still conducted through parametric studies, rigorous numerical methods become a necessity if truly optimum designs are sought for, and the problem intricacies (number of variables, multiple goals, and constraints) make the interactive approaches insufficient. The two practical considerations of electromagnetic (EM)-driven optimization are reliability and computational cost. Repetitive EM simulations may incur unmanageable expenses, whereas the lack of a decent starting point or objective function multimodality may prevent the numerical procedures (especially the local ones) from identifying satisfactory designs. In pursuit of reliability improvements, a design specification adjustment procedure has been recently proposed that improves the immunity of local search procedures to poor starting points, where the objective function is modified by relocating the design goals (e.g., center frequencies) closer to the actual operating parameters of the antenna at the current design, to make them attainable through local search. The goals are then gradually adjusted and converged to the original targets toward the end of the optimization process. In this article, we introduce an algorithm for reliable and low-cost antenna tuning that capitalizes on the specification management scheme while embedding it in variable-resolution optimization framework. In our approach, the EM model fidelity is adaptively adjusted based on the misalignment between the actual and target operating conditions, as well as the convergence status of the algorithm. By initiating the search process from the lowest fidelity model (gradually dialed up to the highest fidelity one), considerable computational savings of almost 60% can be achieved, with respect to the single-fidelity procedure. The speedup is possible without compromising reliability of the optimization process, as demonstrated using three examples of microstrip antennas, designed under different and challenging scenarios.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3234167","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:206606); National Science Centre of Poland(grant numbers:2018/31/B/ST7/02369); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10012669","Adaptive design specifications;antenna optimization;design closure;simulation-driven optimization;variable-fidelity simulations","Optimization;Antennas;Reliability;Computational modeling;Tuning;Reliability engineering;Adaptation models","","20","","74","IEEE","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The realized dual-band patch antenna operating at partial 5G band N78 (3.40–3.60 GHz) and N79 (4.80–4.97 GHz) is with a profile of only 0.5 mm, about  $0.006~\lambda _{{\text {L}}}$  ( $\lambda _{\text {L}}$  refers to the lowest frequencies of the operation band). Measured results show that the −6 dB impedance bandwidths are 3.19–3.42 GHz (230 MHz, 6.9%) and 4.77–5.03 GHz (260 MHz, 5.3%) with average efficiencies of −4.2 dB (39.0%) and −3.7 dB (42.6%) at the lower and higher bands, respectively. As far as the authors know, the proposed antenna is with the lowest profile and highest bandwidth-to-volume ratio (BVR) compared to other reported planar dual-band antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3217640","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101427); Key Research and Development Project of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2022GY-095); High-Level Innovation Talent Project Imported by QinChuangYuan of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:QCYRCXM-2022-33); Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Deep Space Exploration Intelligent Information Technology(grant numbers:2021SYS-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9935779","5G;back cover;dual-band antennas;electric coupling;low-profile;microstrip patch antenna;parasitic patch;smart terminal;smartphone","Antennas;Dual band;Bandwidth;Antenna measurements;Patch antennas;5G mobile communication;Planar arrays","","32","","33","IEEE","2 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The designed lens antenna is fed with 13 waveguides providing beam switching capability in a 110° range. The lens is implemented in the parallel plate waveguide (PPW) technology. The antenna is manufactured in two pieces, and a tolerance analysis indicates that gaps between the pieces can cause a severe performance degradation.

First, electromagnetic band gap (EGB) structures are placed around the feeding waveguides. Second, the electrical contact between the two pieces is improved in critical regions.

The dual-band antenna consists of a rectangular slotted SIW cavity operating at 40 GHz millimeter-wave (MMW) band and a ring slotted SIW cavity operating at 5.2 GHz microwave (MW) band. Due to the self-shielding effect of the SIW cavity, the two radiating elements can be tightly nested with each other, leading to a compact structure with a high ratio of radiating aperture utilization. The MW and MMW SIW radiating elements are fed via a common microstrip line through two separate slots, and they are excited in the hybrid TMh (120, 210) mode and TMh (230, 320) mode respectively. In order to avoid the signal crosstalk, a transverse stub of half-wavelength (in terms of MMW frequency) is added onto the microstrip feed line to prevent the MMW signal from getting into the MW element, while the MMW element can naturally reject the MW signal for its high-pass characteristics. Consequently, good radiation performance is obtained at both the MW and MMW bands, and moreover, the two bands can be independently adjusted.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3232208","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61922031,61871187); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10006750","Aperture-sharing;dual-band antenna;large frequency ratio;millimeter-wave (MMW) antenna;slot antenna;substrate integrated waveguide","Slot antennas;Dual band;Antenna measurements;Microstrip;Microstrip antennas;Antenna feeds;Aperture antennas","","29","","23","IEEE","4 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Alternatively, a frequency-controlled beam-steering method with fixed radiation frequency based on sequential mixing of the propagating IF and local oscillator (LO) waves has been proposed as a low-cost solution. The beam pointing direction can be changed by a single-frequency controller rather than varying any phase shifters or tunable components on the antennas. However, this technique relies on accurately splitting the input IF and LO waves to a mixer’s array through all passive power distribution networks. This communication discusses the practical design consideration of a robust two-wave mixing array and two sets of cascaded unequal power dividers are employed to efficiently distribute the IF and LO signals. To ensure constant radiation frequency, an external reciprocal mixer is used to keep the frequency difference between LO and IF being same as the desired RF.

The results indicate that the proposed transparent flexible metasurface shows more than 10 dB RCS reduction in dual band, wideband, and single band when the sheet resistance ( $R_{s}$ ) of graphene is 70, 240, and  $350~\Omega $ /sq, respectively.
