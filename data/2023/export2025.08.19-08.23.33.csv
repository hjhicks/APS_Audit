Among AM multiplexing techniques, the patch antenna has the advantage of minimization, simple feeding circuits, and easy integration. Nevertheless, limited reports provide theoretical guidance for designing AM multiplexing patch antennas. Herein, we propose a scheme to achieve AM multiplexing via a shared aperture patch antenna. The radiating structure consists of multiple radiating patches sharing a common physical aperture, each of which is responsible for producing different AM-carrying waves. By analyzing the theoretical model built on a dipole representation of the patch antenna, the shapes and the desired current patterns of these patches can be determined according to the AM mode of the expected EMWs. Besides, the sizes and feeding structures of these patches can be studied by investigating their radiating characteristics using characteristic mode (CM) theory. For proof-of-concept, a prototype was designed, fabricated, and measured for the generation of four orthogonal AM-carrying waves coaxially at 5.8 GHz. The experimental results agree reasonably well with the simulated ones, demonstrating that the proposed scheme provides an efficient guidance for the design of AM multiplexing patch antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3237157","Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B17007); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L223030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024147","Angular momentum (AM) multiplexing;characteristic mode (CM) theory;orbital (OAM);shared aperture;spin angular momentum (SAM)","Patch antennas;Multiplexing;Dielectric resonator antennas;Antenna feeds;Resonant frequency;Wireless communication;Metasurfaces","","14","","36","IEEE","20 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method allows the RL agent to learn from its interactions with the environment and to take actions that maximize the reward signal, resulting in the optimal policy. Despite the attractive advantages, the learning process of RL can be challenging and time-consuming, as the agent must explore a vast range of states, actions, and policies. To enhance the efficiency of the design process, we incorporate two key components into the proposed method. First, we utilize domain knowledge, such as the scaling property of antenna, to initialize the antenna parameters. This not only provides interpretability to the design process but also reduces the solution space. Additionally, we employ IL to pretrain the decision-making network within the RL algorithm, which significantly mitigates the data inefficiency issue for RL and reduces the time required to explore feasible solutions. The proposed method has been evaluated using the design of a slot filtering antenna as a case study. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can achieve the antenna design for different frequencies and bandwidth metrics with at least 50% fewer adjusting steps than the traditional RL method, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). The combination of RL and IL also results in a considerable performance boost compared to both pure IL and pure RL for antenna designs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3266051","China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10102809","Automated design;domain knowledge assistance;imitation learning (IL);reinforcement learning (RL)","Antennas;Antenna arrays;Solid modeling;Training;Data models;Reinforcement learning;Prediction algorithms","","22","","39","IEEE","14 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although multilayer PRSs can provide bandwidth enhancement, they have the weaknesses of extremely high design complexity and thresholds in bandwidth improvement. Here, a new approach is proposed to significantly enhance the 3-dB gain bandwidth of the RCA while maintaining high gain and low profile. The method begins by utilizing an open resonator with a spherically modified ground (SMG) to activate multiple resonances akin to Laguerre–Gaussian beam modes. Positive phase gradients are then added to the frequency band between each resonant mode for phase optimization, all provided by a simple metasurface. The proposed approach has been verified across multiple designs and the antenna prototype of one design has been selected for fabrication. The measurements agree very well with simulations, showing a 3-dB gain bandwidth of about 40%, a peak gain of 19 dBi, and a sidelobe level of around −10 dB.

Compact high-frequency high-directivity alternatives to complex, power-hungry phased arrays are desired. Several compact, unidirectional mixed-multipole antennas (UMMAs) based upon mixtures of primarily dipoles and quadrupoles are reported. The simulated performance characteristics of these 28-GHz near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) antennas, notably their large peak directivities and front-to-back ratios (FTBRs), are presented; they are all demonstrated to be superdirective while having attractive radiation efficiencies. Uniform endfire arrays of active closely spaced equal-length idealized wire dipoles are exemplified as reference cases. The Rayleigh quotient (RQ) method typically used to determine their amplitude coefficients is extended for the first time to achieve unidirectional versions. Comparisons between these unconstrained and constrained RQ-designed arrays are made. While the performance characteristics of the single-source broadside-radiating UMMAs approach those of the reference arrays, a direct comparison of a realizable UMMA with the analogous unequal-length, nonuniformly spaced idealized dipole array demonstrates its superiority. A two-element UMMA array that is scalable to a larger number of elements is also presented and shown to be superdirective, illustrating that the attractive properties of its individual elements are maintained even when mutual coupling occurs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3267494","Global Big Data Technologies Centre of the University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10106220","Antenna theory;broadside arrays;endfire arrays;Huygens dipole antennas (HDAs);multipoles;superdirectivity","Dipole antennas;Directive antennas;Antenna arrays;Aperture antennas;Symmetric matrices;Mutual coupling;Wires","","20","","67","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we propose a self-multipath counteraction method by building multiple coupling paths on the radiating branch of one of the antennas, where the coupling energy passing through the multiple coupling paths could be counteracted at the feeding ports. Based on this principle, two types of single-band self-multipath decoupled antenna pairs are constructed with the shorted end and the open end without using any additional decoupling structures. Then, a dual-band and wideband self-multipath decoupled antenna pair is designed by combining the multipath of such two types of single-band self-multipath decoupled antenna pairs. Finally, a four-band and wideband self-multipath decoupled antenna pair is constructed to further widen the decoupling bandwidth based on the dual-band self-multipath decoupled antenna pair. Both simulated and measured results show that the four-band antenna pair can be self-decoupled at four bands with the isolation more than 20 dB over entire N77, N78, and N79 bands, demonstrating excellent multiband and wideband self-decoupling performance.

These CP waves have different maximum gains. This article discusses enhancement in the small gain, not affecting the inherent large gain. Such uncorrelated enhancement in the gain, named isolated gain enhancement (IsoGE), differs from conventional correlated gain enhancement (non-IsoGE). For IsoGE, a parasitic ring is inserted into the open space of the RoMLA while maintaining the low-profile RoMLA structure on the order of  $\lambda _{0}$ /100 with  $\lambda _{0}$  being the free-space operating wavelength. It is found that the ring finally transformed into a round patch is effective for the IsoGE, where the induced current on the patch contributes to increasing the small gain.

This method is based on the transmission characteristics of the conformal strip that feeds the DRA. It is found that when the strip-fed DRA operates in the higher order mode, e.g., TE113 mode, the  $E$ -field coupled to the metal strip of the adjacent passive DRA presents a standing-wave distribution. By appropriately adjusting the dimensions of the feeding strip, the  $E$ -field can form a node with zero amplitude at its bottom where a coaxial probe is connected, preventing the energy from getting into the receiving port and hence achieving a high isolation level without requiring any extra decoupling structure. This self-decoupling method is applicable not only to 1-D H- and E-plane coupled MIMO linear arrays but also to 2-D MIMO planar arrays. To verify its feasibility, a prototype of  $2\times $  2 MIMO planar DRA array is simulated, processed, and tested.

Most of the existing dual-band Wi-Fi 6 patch antennas are with either a superfluous lower or an insufficient higher bandwidth. It remains a challenge to cover these two bands in an exact way. This article addresses the issue of the exact coverage problem of the unbalanced Wi-Fi 6 bands by engineering the TM $_{\mathrm {0.5,0}}$  and TM $_{\mathrm {0.5,1}}$  modes of the half-mode patch while maintaining a very small volume. The design guideline follows three steps. First, select proper patch size to make the first two modes resonate at 2.45 and 5.5 GHz using two ports. Second, optimize feeding positions to make both impedance trajectories in the Smith Chart with minimum sizes. Third, use lumped components to make the two resonances with good matching condition. Using the novel matching method, the resultant half-mode patch with a profile of 3 mm ( $0.024\lambda _{\mathrm {L}}/0.052\lambda _{\mathrm {H}})$  and size of  $22.55\times23.95$  mm2 ( $0.18\times 0.19\lambda _{\mathrm {L}}^{2}/0.39\times 0.41\lambda _{\mathrm {H}}^{2})$  exactly covers the Wi-Fi 6 bands, indicating that the antenna space is taken up fully. As far as the authors know, the proposed antenna is with the smallest volume compared to all the reported Wi-Fi 6 dual-band patch antennas.

By an appropriate modification of the conical ray pattern of the standard Bessel beams, self-accelerating Bessel-like beams can be realized. In the second step, by removing some expanding phase equivalent circles in a periodic fashion and binary modulating of the phase masks, the central main lobe of continuous beams can be modified into pulsating ones. In the third step, we construct real physical models based on the derived theories. All phase coverage can be achieved by changing the height of the proposed cube element. Therefore, the final phase distribution can be mapped to height information of each unit cell. For demonstration, several proof-of-principle metasurfaces are printed and measured, two of which are used to generate Bessel beams along different straight directions and two of which are used to produce Bessel-like beams along the C- and S-shaped trajectories.

When the incident power level increases, the absorptance is enhanced gradually from 19.4% to 92.7%. In an instantaneous bandwidth of 12.0%, the absorption can be tuned from 30% to 80% by changing the power. Furthermore, the dynamic range of power and absorption range can be flexibly customized as required, and the nonlinear functions can be promptly turned off if necessary, showing the advantages of the active mechanism.

In addition, selecting proper output port positions on the circumference of the FL-beamforming network (BFN) may produce phases to excite the antenna array in various configurations to reduce the nulling regions of radiation by different OAM modes. This article presents the characteristics of FL-BFC in its implementation to excite a planar array of antennas for OAM mode radiations.

The analytical expression for the VLF field excited by an electric dipole is first given at arbitrary orientations. By considering the influence of current nonuniformity and mutual coupling, the total radiation field of the array is obtained for both near- and far-zone cases, and the array factor is derived under the far-zone condition. Computations and analyses show that variations in the current phase difference or electrical separation will cause certain changes to the directivity of the array in the near zone, while the radiation pattern in the far zone mainly follows the direction of the geomagnetic field. It is also found that despite the total field of an array can be enhanced by increasing the number of elements, the marginal gain on the field amplitude is descendant as the element number keeps increasing. Moreover, due to the larger wave attenuation in the propagation direction vertical to the magnetic field, the radiation ability of the array will gradually decrease when the geomagnetic inclination angle becomes larger.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3278876","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1804800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001424,62271441); Key Research Project of Zhejiang Laboratory(grant numbers:2020LC0AD01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10137458","Anisotropic magnetoplasma;array factor;curtain array;radiation pattern;very low frequency (VLF)","Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Plasmas;Ionosphere;Earth;Magnetic separation","","4","","31","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a fixed equivalent radiator’s shape, we deal here with the dimensioning issue only. The approach exploits the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the operators relating the radiator/scatterer to the field on  ${\mathscr D}$  and the equivalent panel to the field on  ${\mathscr D}$ . The size of the equivalent radiator is determined by minimizing the error between the primary radiated/scattered field and that radiated using  ${\mathscr D}^{\prime} $ . The error is expressed as a Hermitian, positive semidefinite quadratic form: the dimensioning problem thus consists of determining the size of the equivalent radiator maximizing its minimum eigenvalue.

Applications such as over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) and geolocation satellites are susceptible to flute instability along the propagation path within the ionosphere’s F-layer region. The model developed in this research utilizes a unique phase cube geometry representation of a flute structure derived from two-fluid magnetohydrodynamics (MHDs). The phase cube provides a 3-D interface to a propagator coupled with ray tracing to account for the medium’s refractivity and intermediate field vector incident angles. The forward scattering calculations acquired from the model include a two-position two-frequency mutual coherence function (MCF), a scattering function, a power delay profile, a Doppler power spectrum, a frequency correlation function, and a spatial coherence function. Horizontal and vertical polarization effects are also examined with respect to the flute structure geometry. Delay-Doppler maps provide insights into the physical characteristics of scintillation arcs observed in the frequency-domain analysis of the dynamic spectrum. The results provide a baseline observation for spatial, temporal, and frequency characteristics observed after HF propagation through a flute channel. The results also indicate that the flute channel is likely to cause frequency-selective characteristics on the signal propagation along with significant spectral broadening in the Doppler power spectrum.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3269537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10110318","F-layer;flute;phase cube;propagation","Plasmas;Ions;Magnetic separation;Geometry;Perturbation methods;Ionosphere;Computational modeling","","","","21","USGov","27 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The simulated radio channels are compared to their measured counterparts at 4 and 14 GHz in terms of path loss, delay, and angular spreads. Validation of channel simulations for O2I cases is rare, and so far nonexistent for above-6-GHz bands. This work reveals the importance of a floor plan model in channel simulations; it is confirmed that path loss can be replicated with a mean error (ME) under 6 dB utilizing a simple interior path loss model instead of a detailed building interior model. Neglecting to model the interior results in high delay and angular spread errors. By modeling the interior, the RT simulations achieve relative ME of under 10% for delay and angular spreads and under 1.5 dB for path loss.

To accurately simulate or predict the performance of ship radar systems, the evaporation duct model and rough sea surface models are usually incorporated into the parabolic equation to model electromagnetic wave propagation. The Paulus–Jeske (PJ) model and Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) model are the most widely used to make the vertical atmospheric refractivity profile, and the roughness sea surface is modeled with the effective reflection coefficient of the rough surface or the generation of the rough sea surface. There are four widely used rough sea surface approximations called Ament, Miller–Brown, shadowed, and hybrid for rough sea surface modeling. In this study, numerical simulation is first used to compare the different rough sea surface modeling methods. Then, evaporation duct measurement data and C-band propagation experimental data are used to compare the evaporation duct models and the four rough sea surface models that are combined with evaporation duct models for propagation loss prediction. The simulation results show that the shadowing of radio waves by the rough sea surface and sea surface structure are important factors affecting the transmission of radio waves in evaporation ducts, and the difference in the path loss predicted by different rough sea surface approximations may exceed 10 dB at the same location. In particular, the frequency and wind speed will increase. In addition, the experimental data show that the evaporation duct can be better diagnosed using different evaporation duct models at different atmospheric stabilities. When the air–sea temperature difference is positive, the PJ evaporation duct is recommended; otherwise, the NPS model is better, and the results of the shadowed and hybrid rough sea surface models are in better agreement with the observations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3276571","National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U21A20457,62271457); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130128","Evaporation duct;radio wave propagation;rough sea surface","Sea surface;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;Surface waves;Ducts;Surface impedance;Mathematical models","","21","","40","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The latter, although less rigorous than the former, is more flexible and applicable to a wider range of real-world cases, including non-Gaussian surfaces, surfaces with electrically small correlation lengths and scattering from material inhomogeneities that are often present under the surface. Unfortunately, the ER model, with the exception of its Lambertian version, does not satisfy reciprocity, which is an important physical-soundness requirement for any propagation model. In the present work, without compromising its effectiveness and its simple and yet sound power-balance approach, we propose a reciprocal version of the ER model, which can be easily implemented and can replace the old version in ray-based propagation models. The new model is analyzed and compared with the old one and with other popular models.

The generalized model structure consists of three blocks for feature extraction, scenario prediction, and attribute prediction, respectively. The PDP data is collected from a motherboard desktop environment under five different physical arrangement scenarios. Within each scenario, data is collected several times while varying a different physical attributes for each scenario. Two steps of data augmentation are applied to expand the size and to improve the resolution (difference between the neighboring attributes) of the measured dataset for the robust training and thorough evaluation of the proposed model. The proposed model is evaluated and compared with a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based model on an expanded measured and averaged interpolated dataset. It is shown that both models perform very well on the expanded measured dataset with nearly 100% prediction accuracy on both scenarios and attributes. The MLP-based model suffers performance degradation on the averaged interpolated dataset with up to a 9% drop of classification accuracy on attribute prediction tasks, while our ResNet-based feature concatenated model performs equally in both scenarios. Feature activation mapping (FAM) and grad-class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) approaches are applied to provide visual explanations highlighting characteristics of the input PDP used for model decisions. FAM shows that the MLP-based model focuses on the multipath generated peaks of the PDP where some interpolated neighboring data points cannot be distinguished.

The capability of a model to predict reasonable outputs given an input that is beyond the data with which the model is trained, namely, “generalizability,” is a fundamental challenge and a key factor for its practical deployment. In this article, by leveraging the concept of graph neural networks (GNNs), a prediction model for indoor propagation that is “generalized” to not only transmitter (Tx) positions but also new geometries is presented. We demonstrate that a geometry and a Tx antenna can be modeled as a graph with all necessary information being included, and a GNN can acquire the knowledge of propagation physics through “learning” from these graphs. We further show that the model can be generalized to new geometry shapes, beyond the shape (square) for model training. We provide useful information on how to obtain an acceptable accuracy for different scenarios. We also discuss the potential solutions to further improve the model’s capability.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3281061","Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan(grant numbers:JPMI10001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10144543","Artificial neural network (ANN);electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure assessment;graph neural network (GNN);indoor environment;radio wave propagation;ray tracing (RT);surrogate model","Geometry;Predictive models;Numerical models;Graph neural networks;Antennas;Data models;Solid modeling","","15","","29","IEEE","5 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Herein, we present a novel method of obtaining incident power and relative phase distribution using energy harvesting circuits (rectifiers) that can be integrated into the RIS. Four versions of the energy harvesting circuit are proposed that offer great control over the sensitivity of the system. The sensitivity of the proposed rectifier circuit is −42 dBm for direct rectification. The inclusion of direct current (dc) bias and radio frequency (RF) amplifiers greatly increases the sensitivity of the rectifiers. The received power and phase distribution across the unit dipoles of RIS are simulated to demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.

According to the analysis of field distributions of the resonant modes on the circular patch, we initially reveal the mechanism of high-order modes suppression by introducing a pair of common mode (CM) exciting signals with equal amplitude and the same phase at specific locations on the circular patch antenna. Afterward, to implement this design concept, the exciting signals realized by a T-shaped microstrip feed line with two pairs of extra parallel arms are arranged on both sides of the circular patch antenna. Owing to this excitation scheme, the influence of the harmonics of the antenna has been reduced, and two zeros on both sides of the passband are achieved by the cross-coupling form. Besides, an enhanced bandwidth is also realized attributing to an additional resonant mode introduced by the extra parallel arms. Finally, to verify the feasibility of the developed scheme, a prototype filtering antenna is fabricated and tested. Measured results show that the demonstrator exhibits an impedance bandwidth of 10.2% (2.42–2.68 GHz).

A tri-band reflectarray centering at 25 GHz (low-band), 32 GHz (middle-band), and 37 GHz (high-band) is designed first to demonstrate the independent beam shaping over triple bands. Then, two waveguide-based reflectarrays with the broadband achromatic feature are designed, which show stable performance from 22 to 38 GHz with a relative bandwidth of 53.3%. The prototypes are conveniently fabricated using additive manufacturing, and their performance is experimentally verified.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3278799","Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program(grant numbers:2017ZT07X032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10137400","Additive manufacturing;metal-only;millimeter-wave (mm-wave);reflectarray antenna;tri-band/broadband achromatic","Broadband antennas;Reflection;Reflector antennas;Broadband communication;Cutoff frequency;Dipole antennas;Phase measurement","","14","","32","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, to employ UAVs effectively, knowledge of the signal’s propagation in the environment is required. Otherwise, communications and localization could be hindered. The radio range, the packet delivery ratio (PDR), and the large- and small-scale fading of body-UAV LoRa links at 868 MHz when the radio wearer is in a Mediterranean forest are here characterized for the first time with a near-ground UAV having a maximum flying height of 30 m. A log-distance model accounting for the body shadowing and the wearer’s movements is derived. Over the full LoRa radio range of about 600 m, the new model predicts the path loss (PL) better than the state-of-the-art ones, with a reduction of the median error even by ~10 dB. The observed small-scale fading is severe and follows a Nakagami-m distribution.

Two constraints in the spatial and frequency domains are imposed on the optimization problem. The objective of sparsifying the relaxation variable is exploited in constructing the constraint in the spatial domain, and  ${l_{\infty} } $ -spatial response variation (SRV) is introduced in the frequency domain constraint to reduce frequency variance. These constraints enable a desirable trade-off between beamwidth and FI properties while achieving accurate spatial-frequency response control. Since the resulting optimization problem is sparse and non-convex, it is then proposed to be solved by exploiting the reweighted- $l_{1}$  norm in this communication. The remarked feature of the new approach is the improved target detection and anti-interference performance in radar and communication systems without waveform distortion. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3278083","Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2023YFSY0008,2023YFG0291); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10134569","l∞-spatial response variation (SRV) optimization;beampattern synthesis;frequency invariant (FI);minimum beamwidth;relax optimization","Wideband;Optimization;Frequency synthesizers;Frequency-domain analysis;Frequency control;Narrowband;Cost function","","5","","26","IEEE","24 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
