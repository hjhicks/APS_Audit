The feeding array is organized in non-regular overlapped sub-arrays (OSAs) in order to generate contiguous shaped beams in two polarizations with a single reflector. The main novelty is the generation of the non-regular multibeam coverage with differently shaped beams which equalizes the traffic demand per beam as generated by a non-uniform distribution of users over the satellite coverage. The entire feeding array is organized in two interleaved and partially overlapped groups of sub-arrays, one per polarization, to better satisfy the beam overlap requirements and isolation between co-polarized beams. A complex BFN has been developed as a monolithic component through a 3-D additive manufacturing (AM) technique.

The basic antenna consists of two parallel TE201 resonant cavities and is directly fed by a grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW). Radiation slot apertures are modified to increase aperture radiation efficiency and improve radiation patterns and gain. The antenna scheme is analyzed and a 220 GHz  $2\times2$  slot array antenna is developed as an example.

This article discusses a circularly polarized (CP) metaloop antenna that has a loop circumference of  ${C} _{\mathrm {LOOP}}= 1 \lambda _{\text {g}}= n\lambda _{0}$  with  $n>1$ , thereby creating a large area within the loop, where  $\lambda _{\text {g}}$  ( $= 2~\pi /\beta $ ) and  $\lambda _{0}$  ( $= 2~\pi /k_{0}$ ) are the guide wavelength of the current on the loop and the free-space wavelength, respectively. Values for the propagation phase constant within the range of  $-1 < \beta /k_{0} < 0$  are used in this article. It is found that metaloop antennas for  $n = 3$ , 4, and 5 generate a CP broadside beam (axial beam) with gain bandwidths (GBWs) of approximately 6%, 5%, and 4%, respectively. The VSWR across the GBWs is less than two and the axial ratio is less than 3 dB. The radiation efficiencies for  $n=3$ , 4, and 5 are approximately 48%, 69%, and 83%, respectively.

Those antennas are considered a promising alternative to parabolic reflectors and phased arrays due to their extremely low profile and their ability to provide high gain, shaped beams and multibeams. However, pattern synthesis with MTS antennas is very challenging because of the single active control point and the need to control surface and leaky waves through the MTS. An accurate optimization of the radiation pattern, along with the sidelobe level requires full-wave modeling of the feeding structure, including its coupling with the MTS. MTS synthesis methods existing in the literature usually approximate the feeder model, and neglect its coupling with the MTS. Such approximation may lead to more than 1 dB error in the predicted antenna directivity. This article presents a technique for optimization of the far-field pattern, built on a Method of Moments (MoM) analysis tool in which the MTS coupling with the feeder, a coax probe, is fully considered. The MTS is modeled as an arbitrarily shaped, spatially modulated electric sheet impedance in a layered medium. At each optimization iteration, the complexity of the underlying analysis is  $\mathcal {O}(\text {N}\log \text {N})$  owing to the use of a fast Fourier transforms (FFT)-based acceleration. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through the optimization of MTSs radiating a pencil beam and a conical beam with orbital angular momentum (OAM).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3211735","Fonds pour la Formation à la Recherche dans l’Industrie et dans l’Agriculture (FRIA); Chargé de Recherches Program from the Belgium Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9915033","Broken rooftop;fast Fourier transforms (FFT);impedance boundary condition (IBC);magnetic frill;metasurfaces (MTSs);method of moments (MoM)","Probes;Impedance;Optimization;Antenna feeds;Surface impedance;Method of moments;Conductors","","17","","45","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a pair of symmetrical SSPPs transmission lines (TLs) is applied to an endfire antenna. To realize an endfire antenna, the SSPPs TLs are supported by a balun with a 180° phase shifter, and this makes each pair of SSPPs units works as a dipole. Next, we study the dispersive curve of this dipole-shaped SSPPs unit and get its relationship between phase constant and frequency. Then, the Hansen–Woodyard condition is used to get a maximum gain at endfire direction. Moreover, in order to excite a radiation into the free space, we compose a tapered structure with this pair of SSPPs TLs. As a result, an endfire antenna with zero tilted angle operates in the frequency range of 9–11 GHz and achieves an average gain of 11.51 dBi. In addition, this SSPPs antenna realizes a high aperture efficiency up to 13.26 dBi $/\lambda _{0}^{2}$ . The simulated and measured results are in good agreements over the operating band.

Such a bilayer metasurface is highly reflective when illuminated by microwave from one side, while exhibit a high absorption when illuminated from the other side. Moreover, when the optically transparent, weather-proofing bilayer metasurface acts as a radome, it can greatly enhance the gain and reduce RCS of the solar panel-integrated microstrip antenna without affecting the performance of optical devices (e.g., photovoltaic panels, flat panel displays, or light emitting devices). We provide the analytical formulation and design guidelines for the bilayer metasurface and the integrated cavity antenna.

The antenna is composed of a four-layer lens excited by a modified slot antenna. Each layer of the lens case is filled with fabricated mixtures of engineered materials that have specific relative permittivity values. The exciting antenna is made compact by utilizing meandered feed lines and substrate folded technique. The number of layers of the lens and the specification of each layer are determined by minimizing the generalized reflection coefficient of the antenna. A focused plan-wave radiation is achieved by tapering the lens based on the theory of total internal reflection. The study of  $E$ -field quality inside the torso demonstrates that the proposed lens successfully converts spherical wave radiation into a local plane-wave radiation, resulting in 11 dB improvement in wave penetration inside the torso compared to the body-matched antenna (without lens). The measured results show that the antenna operates over a wide band from 0.43 to 1.85 GHz (125% fractional bandwidth), which is a merit for the torso imaging application. Furthermore, the antenna has the physical size of 110  $\times 110\times48$  mm3, corresponding to  $0.15\times 0.15\times 0.06\lambda _{0}^{3}$ , where  $\lambda _{0}$  is the wavelength at the lowest working frequency.

"Bandwidth and SNR of Small Receiving Antennas: To Match or Not to Match","K. Sarabandi; M.

The goal is to demonstrate that a small antenna with low radiation resistance and high input reactance, when directly connected to a high-impedance (high-impd) receiver, can provide significantly better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than when it is matched to a standard 50  $\Omega $  input-impedance receiver. Theoretical analysis is first carried out to compare the noise performance of the two receivers by deriving analytical expressions for the SNRs of the receivers. It is shown that the SNR of a high-impd receiver is superior to that of an impedance-matched receiver. Subsequently, two test receivers are constructed and characterized to verify the theoretical calculations. The measured SNR of the high-impd receiver is 11.4 dB higher than that of the matched receiver, even though the first-stage amplifier used in the high-impd receiver has a much worse noise performance compared to that used in the matched receiver. This study demonstrates that matching a receiving antenna to the load impedance is not always the optimal solution as far as the SNR is concerned. Furthermore, unlike a small antenna with a narrow-band matching circuit, a small antenna connected to a high-impd receiver without any matching network provides a very wide bandwidth and overcomes the gain-bandwidth limitation of small antennas. This discovery breaks new ground in the realization of compact wideband systems for low-frequency communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3215229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9928059","HF communications;impedance matching;receiving antennas;signal-to-noise ratio (SNR);small antennas","Receiving antennas;Antennas;Signal to noise ratio;Impedance;Dipole antennas;Bandwidth;Antenna theory","","9","","14","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Undoubtedly, the most important advantage thereof is a possibility of a dramatic reduction of computational expenses associated with computer-aided design procedures, especially those relying on full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations. In particular, the employment of fast replacement models (surrogates) allows for repetitive evaluations of the antenna structure at negligible cost, thereby accelerating processes such as parametric optimization, multi-criterial design, or uncertainty quantification. Notwithstanding, a construction of reliable data-driven surrogates is seriously hindered by the curse of dimensionality and the need for covering broad ranges of geometry/material parameters, which is imperative from the perspective of design utility. A recently proposed constrained modeling approach with knowledge-based stochastic determination of the model domain addresses this issue to a large extent and has been demonstrated to enable quasi-global modeling capability while maintaining a low setup cost. This work introduces a novel technique that capitalizes on the domain confinement paradigm and incorporates deep-learning-based regression modeling to facilitate handling of highly-nonlinear antenna characteristics. The presented framework is demonstrated using three microstrip antennas and favorably compared to several state-of-the-art techniques. The predictive power of our models reaches remarkable 2% of a relative rms error (averaged over the considered antenna structures), which is a significant improvement over all benchmark methods.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3216064","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:217771); Narodowe Centrum Nauki(grant numbers:2020/37/B/ST7/01448); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9930873","Antenna design;deep learning (DL);electromagnetic (EM)-driven design;learning by examples;surrogate modeling","Antennas;Computational modeling;Data models;Predictive models;Costs;Analytical models;Deep learning","","18","","82","IEEE","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The array consists of the proposed low-band (LB) transparent element and a  $4\times $  4 broadband antenna array operating at high-band (HB). The LB radiator is a dual-polarized dipole, loaded with dielectric blocks both on the top and bottom sides. The LB element is placed right above the center of HB array. Since the dielectric-loaded radiator achieves broadband transparent characteristics in HB, the HB array can radiate with almost no blockage from the LB element. The mechanism of the characteristics is studied by using an equivalent circuit. Experimental results show that the blockage effect of the LB radiator on the broadband HB element is reduced by loading dielectric blocks. For verification, a dual-band antenna array operating at 0.76–1.03 GHz and 3.4–5 GHz bands is fabricated and measured. Compared with the isolated HB array, the peak gain deterioration of the aperture-shared array is below 0.8 dB.

In recent years, mechanical antennas whose size does not depend on the electromagnetic (EM) wavelength have attracted researchers’ attention. Acoustically excited antennas (AEAs), as a kind of mechanical antenna, can achieve reciprocal transmission and reception. AEAs utilize internal charge and magnetization oscillations of piezoelectric materials and magnetoelectric (ME) composite materials, respectively, to radiate EM waves, which enables the size of the antenna to be related to the wavelength of the acoustic wave, reducing the size of the antenna by 4–5 orders of magnitude over conventional antennas.

First, directivity upper bounds have been derived analytically in the case of Huygens-source- and electrical-dipole-based arrays using spherical wave expansion (SWE). The fundamental bounds are derived when the interelement spacing  $d$  tends to 0 and as a function of the number of the elements ( $P$ ) composing the array. Furthermore, the complex excitation coefficients associated with end-fire arrays of  $P$  infinitesimal Huygens sources and electrical dipoles are synthesized as a function of  $d$  to achieve maximum directivity. For this purpose, synthesis procedures based on SWE and array theory are used. When  $d$  tends to 0, the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the proposed upper bounds. The maximum superdirectivity approaches a value of P  $^{2}+$  2  $P$  and  $P^{2} + P - 1/2$ , respectively, in the case of Huygens sources and electrical dipoles.

It consists of two identical antenna elements spacing about half wavelength. First, a 1-to-2 Y-shaped power divider with wideband anti-phase outputs is designed to feed two modified Vivaldi radiators. The currents on the two radiating surfaces keep the same direction in a wideband to increase radiation without being canceled. Second, the square-ring unit cell is analyzed to form metasurface, placed in the front of the radiator. It can guide the forward electromagnetic (EM) radiation while reducing the backward radiation. Third, a U-shaped slot is etched between the two modified Vivaldi radiators. It is approximated as an effective electrically small dipole radiator. Such arrangement further effectively enhances the radiation performance in the direction of the main lobe and destructively interferes with the sidelobe radiation. These features make the antenna far-field radiation pattern reshaped. Thereby, the gain is improved in a wide bandwidth.

Wideband gain enhancement contributes to improve the detection capability of the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar sensor.

For this purpose, two novel GRIN MS lens topologies are proposed, where an optimized refractive index distribution along with the lens aperture is generated using an improved analytical formulation. In the first lens configuration, the core layer (CL) is sandwiched between two similar impedance matching layers (IMLs) on each side. In the second configuration, the CL is still surrounded by two IMLs on both sides, but one of the IMLs, in this case, is improved to avoid the requirement of an additional dielectric layer between the lens and the biological tissue. All the layers of the MS lens are based on an array of especially designed square ring-shaped unit cells. The proposed MS lens-based DFHA enhances the signal penetration by a maximum of 12 dB at 100 mm penetration inside the torso compared to the case without a lens. It also facilitates better spatial resolution due to the presence of an MS lens, which shrinks threefold the 3 dB beamwidth at 100 mm inside the torso than that of the DFHA without an MS lens. The proposed GRIN MS lens integrated DFHA is fabricated and tested on a realistic torso phantom to evaluate the tumor detection capability deep inside the torso.

An expression for the mutual impedance is derived in terms of a double spectral integral. Asymptotic extraction techniques are employed to largely reduce the computation time of one of the spectral integrals. For the other integral, when a guided wave contribution dominates the mutual coupling between two array elements, the result can be approximated as the residue of the spectral polar singularity, providing a closed-form solution of the coupling for elements at electrically large distances. The complete method enables simulations of entire finite arrays with hundreds or even thousands of elements in minutes. The same structure would require impractical computation time when analyzed with general-purpose commercial software. The method allows estimating the performance of finite connected arrays. This is particularly relevant because wideband connected arrays are known to exhibit higher edge effects compared to narrowband arrays, due to the high interelement mutual coupling.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209272","European Space Agency (ESA) for the Project “Antenna User Terminal with Wide Angle Impedance Matching Metamaterial Radome”(grant numbers:4000127381/19/NL/AF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906850","Antenna arrays;finite array simulations;finite edge effects;wideband arrays","Impedance;Phased arrays;Wideband;Voltage;Metals;Magnetic domains;Finite element analysis","","1","","30","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering the versatile demands in practical scenarios, the essential challenge is to design the metasurface with spectral compatibility to satisfy the various applications. Here, we proposed an optically transparent hybrid mechanism metasurface (HMM) incorporating absorption, polarization conversion, and phase cancellation mechanisms for wideband, wide-angle, and omnidirectional scattering suppression performance. The unit cell integrates absorption and polarization conversion capabilities by etching the indium tin oxide (ITO) film into the specific structure, exhibiting wideband ( $7.44-31.31$  GHz), wide-angle ( $\!< 45^{\circ }$ ), high-efficiency ( $\!\ge 90$ %), and omnidirectional co-polarized scattering suppression performance. Moreover, the phase cancellation mechanism is implemented by distributing the unit cell and its mirror structure in the chessboard configuration, which provides cross-polarized reflection reduction capability for the HMM. Therefore, the HMM achieves a significant total radar cross section (RCS) reduction by integrating multiple scattering suppression mechanisms. Eventually, the simulated and measured results indicate that the proposed HMM can realize more than 10 dB total monostatic and bistatic RCS reduction within 7.49-32.23 and 7.46-30.55 GHz, respectively. In addition, good specular and omnidirectional RCS reduction capabilities are also obtained. Furthermore, the HMM also presents good optical transparency, which is attributed to the high transmittance of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates and the ITO films. The proposed strategy has potential application in the multifunctional stealth design of stealth platforms.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3217883","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071347,62171335); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937183","Hybrid mechanism metasurface (HMM);indium tin oxide (ITO);omnidirectional;radar cross section (RCS) reduction;transparent","Scattering;Metasurfaces;Indium tin oxide;Absorption;Optical scattering;Optical films;Hidden Markov models","","35","","46","IEEE","3 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed lens is not only advantageous regarding its planar topology but also offers a solution to the chronic problem surrounding planar phased array antenna and planar lenses: scan loss. In this article, ray optics and ray transfer matrix are applied to Galilean lens configuration from which the concept of scan enhancement and compensating parameters are conceived. The basic idea of compensating lies in re-focusing the portion of the beams and suppressing transmission at extreme angles. Visual analysis of the wave refraction and designing of the lens system is conducted using 2-D ray-tracing code. Full-wave simulation validates the effectiveness of the proposed idea by extending the limited scan range of the phased array antenna from 45° to 58° with gain fluctuation below 1.1 dB at E-band. The radiation efficiency is calculated to be 0.86 at 76.5 GHz. Furthermore, the proposed lens system is fabricated using low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology and experimentally verified.

A novel hybrid radiating structure is introduced to enable approximately consistent initial beam direction at the boresight for both bands and therefore large beam coverage, by exciting different sets of the radiation elements at each of the two bands. The hybrid structure is formed of interlaced conventional CTS elements and those backed by double-ridge waveguide slots. The latter suppresses the lower band while allowing the high band to radiate. This configuration allows maximum aperture reuse. A parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) diplexer combines the generated plane waves from the two bands to enable one-side excitation. Combined with the nonuniform slow wave structure (SWS), optimized amplitude distribution is achieved across the two frequency bands, thereby improving the antenna efficiency.

Typically, RISs are based on dynamically reconfigurable reflectarrays (RAs), i.e., 2-D arrays of passive patch antennas, individually switchable between two or more reflection phases. The spatial resolution of provided reflected field patterns is governed by the aperture dimensions and the number of patches to meet the requirements of different communication scenarios and environments. Here, we demonstrate a 1 bit RIS for 5 GHz Wi-Fi band made by assembling together multiple independently operating and structurally detached building blocks all powered by the same DC source. Each block contains four separately phase-switchable patch antennas with varactor diodes and a common microcontroller extracting digital control commands from modulated infrared light illuminating the entire RIS.

Two positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are integrated into the tunable resonant layer to achieve the 1-bit phase resolution in either transmission or reflection mode.

In SAF design, the entire aperture is divided into transmission and reflection modes co-existing, and the arrangement and phase distribution are optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to achieve minimum sidelobe levels (SLLs) and peak gain of bidirectional beam.

By switching the bias states of the PIN diodes, the induced complex current of the top patch is alterable and the phasor beam steering can be delivered. Thus, in the conformal array design, the phase compensation can be realized by the phase pattern reconfiguration of the phasor beam steering antenna instead of the conventionally used phase delay lines.

If the embedded element patterns (EEPs) are measured using at least two known loading conditions, the patterns can be used to determine the array mutual impedance matrix. In previous work, this result has been derived with the simplifying assumption that the impedance of the source connected to the driven element changes along with the load impedances connected to the nondriven elements. In a practical test configuration, the source impedance cannot be readily changed. We analyze the case of EEPs measured with a fixed source impedance and changing impedances on the nondriven elements. The transformation from one set of EEPs to another with fixed source impedance is more complex than in the case of a source impedance that changes with the load impedances. The transformation depends on the coupling between elements and is only weakly sensitive to the element self-impedances. With measured EEPs for an array of identical elements, the impedance matrix can be found up to a scale factor. We demonstrate the method experimentally by measuring the patterns of an antenna array terminated with one loading condition and repeating the pattern measurements with a different loading condition. The mutual impedance matrix extracted from the pattern measurements compared to network analyzer mutual impedance measurements is accurate to within 1– $2~\Omega $  for most of the mutual impedances.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3217324","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1727010); Western Australian State Government; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9934005","Antenna arrays;embedded element patterns (EEPs);mutual impedance","Impedance;Antenna measurements;Impedance measurement;Loading;Loaded antennas;Extraterrestrial measurements;Antenna radiation patterns","","8","","7","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm can be used to conform to radomes, parts of autonomous vehicles, or any surface. The algorithm is agnostic to both element design and surface curvature. This allows the user to design a FSS for any curved surface while maintaining its response comparable to a flat array. The algorithm outputs two standard tessellation language (STL) files, one describing the curved surface and the other the elements of the FSS placed onto the curved surface. This makes the algorithm suitable for 3-D printing using systems with more than three axes or for flexible electronics. Several examples of arbitrary surfaces are shown. Lastly, the algorithm was applied to a Jerusalem-cross (JC) FSS on a nonsymmetrical parabolic dome. The dimensions of the parabolic dome were chosen to test the response of the array on a rather extreme surface against a projected array on the same surface.

The FSS design consists of a 9  $\times $  9 array of square loops on  $0.31\lambda \times 0.31\lambda $  square unit cells with trenches between the loops. The trenches are filled with liquids under test (LTUs). The structure operates at 4.6 GHz without any liquid. When liquids are inserted in the trenches, the resonance frequency varies in relation to the dielectric constant of the liquid. This is observed by measuring the transmission coefficient ( $S_{21}$ ). Butan-1-ol, ethanol, methanol, propan-2-ol, and xylene are used to demonstrate the sensing function. A maximum sensitivity of 8.65% for xylene was achieved. Furthermore, very low differences were observed between the measured and expected dielectric constant and loss tangent, thus validating the design.

Correspondingly, we extend previous formulations to enable excitation of the MG by the active array elements, deriving analytical relations connecting the passive and active element distribution and electrical properties with the scattered fields, eventually allowing resolution of the detailed device configuration leading to optimal directivity. Importantly, considering typical active array applications, the semianalytical synthesis scheme is further developed to take full advantage of the various degrees of freedom in the system, harnessing them to support scanning in a wide range of extreme angles while maintaining a single directive beam.

Specifically, the RL-based agent can interact with the EM design software without engaging human designers, allowing for automated design. Besides, the data accumulated during EM software simulation in the early design stage are reused as training data to build a DNN surrogate model to replace the time-consuming EM simulation and further accelerate the training of RL to achieve better optimization of EM design.

Specifically, the impact of digital filter design on different PA applications is studied. In the first part, an overview of noise shaping in a hexagonal lattice PA is investigated for the first time. Compared with the Nyquist square lattice, the hexagonal counterpart yields a much smaller invisible region which is a challenge for pushing the error out of the visible region. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the method suppresses the quantization lobes (QLs), realigns the point deviation, and may promote antenna gain. For those with critically large array pitch, the digital filter stopband may become prohibitively wide, contributing to a negligible antenna gain loss. The second part uses the method for restoring null(s). It is shown that the noise-shaping approach is quite effective in enhancing the fidelity of the system in nulling the spatially localized interferences. However, considering the discrepancy between addressing the QLs as a harmonic error and nulls buried beneath the quantization residue, the digital filter design is challenging and needs high attenuation level. Specifically, the number of nulls is an essential criterion for the method’s success. The computations are double-checked with full-wave simulations. The results verify the viability of the approach with a minor deflection from the computation. The third part investigates the noise-shaping approach in PA of the sparse element spacing. The complication of digital filter design with respect to antenna gain loss is investigated for different scenarios. Optimization is used for complicated cases to find an optimal filter to minimize the antenna gain loss.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3220936","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9950537","Beam shaping;digital attenuator (DA);digital phase shifter (DPS);hexagonal lattice;noise shaping;null steering;phased array (PA)","Lattices;Quantization (signal);Noise shaping;Digital filters;Phased arrays;Array signal processing;Distortion","","","","48","IEEE","14 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SSM extraction for characterizing scatterers is provided, which then is used to replace detailed practical scatterers in numerical simulation. The SSM with the frequency-dependent features’ behavior is described by multiple-Lorentz pole pairs, and the coefficients of the Lorentz model are obtained by using a rational fitting method. An easy-to-implement FDTD algorithm combined with the Lorentz-described SSM is proposed and presented. The efficiency of the proposed framework is proven by comparing it with conventional FDTD.

The inability to analyze multiply connected objects is a glaring omission. In this article, we address this challenge. IGA provides seamless integration between the geometry and analysis using the same basis set to represent both. In particular, IGA methods using subdivision basis sets exploit the fact that the basis functions used for surface description are smooth (with continuous second derivatives) almost everywhere. On simply connected surfaces, this permits the definition of basis sets that are divergence-free and curl-free. What is missing from this suite is a basis set that is both divergence-free and curl-free, a necessary ingredient for a complete Helmholtz decomposition of currents on multiply connected structures. In this article, we achieve this missing ingredient numerically using random polynomial vector fields. We show that this basis set is analytically divergence-free and curl-free. Furthermore, we show that these bases recover curl-free, divergence-free, and both curl-free and divergence-free fields.

From geometrical point of view, the combinational object is partially body of revolution (BoR) and is decomposed into BoR and non-BoR parts in the DDM framework. For the surface of all subdomains, which are modeled by IBC, the efficient SDIEs are used to construct the IE-based DDM. However, special care must be taken for the touching interfaces between subdomains. After choosing appropriate surface impedance for touching interfaces, the SDIEs of these surfaces are replaced by adapted self-dual Robin-type transmission conditions, which are derived by imposing field continuities in the SDIEs. Then, for transforming the IEs to a matrix system, the method of moments (MoM) is applied in an efficient manner to obtain an effectively reduced number of unknowns. Specifically, while the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions are used in non-BoR subdomains, the efficient BoR basis functions are utilized for expanding the currents of BoR subdomains. Memory requirements are considerably reduced in the proposed method, first by using the DDM, and second by utilizing the BoR basis in the BoR subdomain.

Channel models are of great importance for the development and performance assessment of massive MIMO systems. Since massive MIMO systems are equipped with large-aperture antenna arrays, antenna elements at different spatial positions would observe different channel multipath characteristics, which is so-called spatial nonstationarity (SnS). The SnS property of multipaths has been observed in many reported massive MIMO channel measurements. However, characterization and explanations of SnS have not been adequate in existing statistical channel modeling, and deterministic models (e.g., ray tracing) are difficult to implement due to the high complexity. This article proposes a realistic yet low-complexity SnS channel modeling framework for massive MIMO systems and its validation based on both channel measurements and ray-tracing simulations. In this work, we first perform a 6 GHz-bandwidth millimeter-wave (mmWave) indoor channel measurement campaign with a 0.5 m radius virtual uniform circular array (UCA), where the SnS phenomena are clearly observed. Then, we propose the massive MIMO channel modeling framework that captures the observed SnS property from the physical propagation mechanisms of dominant multipaths in mmWave channels, i.e., blockage, reflection, and diffraction. Compared to traditional stationary channel modeling, only one extra parameter accounting for SnS has been added in the proposed framework, which is desirable for its low-complexity implementation. Finally, the proposed framework is validated with site-specific ray-tracing simulations. The SnS phenomena observed in the measurements are reproduced well in the modeling results according to the proposed framework, and high similarities between the target channels and modeling results are achieved. The proposed framework is valuable for the development of massive MIMO systems since it is realistic, low complexity, and accurate.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3218759","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61925102); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1805002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62031019); BUPT-CMCC Joint Innovation Center; BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation(grant numbers:CX2022202); Aalborg University (AAU) through the 21NRM03 MEWS Project from the European Partnership on Metrology and under the framework of European COST INTERACT ACTION (CA20120)-cofinanced from the European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme and by the Participating States.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9940939","Massive MIMO channel measurements and modeling;millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel sounding;ray tracing;spatial nonstationarity (SnS);visibility region (VR)","Massive MIMO;Antenna measurements;Ray tracing;Antenna arrays;Millimeter wave communication;Optical variables measurement;Power measurement","","79","","54","IEEE","7 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we set the unknown measurement data as a constant and design an indicator function for the OSM. To demonstrate the applicability of the OSM and its dependence on the constant, we show that the designed indicator function can be represented in terms of an infinite series of the Bessel functions of integer order, antenna configuration, and applied constant. To improve the imaging performance for a proper identification of the object, we design a new indicator function of the OSM with multiple sources, rigorously explore its mathematical structure, and discover some properties including the improvement and uniqueness.

This article focuses on inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of a special composite scene consisting of a target and layered rough surfaces (TLRS) below it, such as a target and a snow-soil layered scene. Differently from previous imaging algorithms based on the frequency-domain (FD) method, this article combines the time-domain ray bouncing (TDRB) method with imaging algorithms to develop an accurate ISAR imaging framework to obtain composite images of the TLRS scene. To improve the simulation efficiency of the time-domain (TD) echo matrix for ISAR imaging, the multi-thread parallel is used to accelerate the TD scattering algorithm, then, the ISAR imaging formulas based on scattering field expressions in the TLRS scene are derived. Since the linear frequency modulation pulse used in traditional radar imaging has longer pulsewidth than the Gaussian, the matched filter is modified to realize pulse compression under modulating Gaussian pulse excitations to enhance the imaging efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed ISAR imaging framework ensures the image quality and improves the simulation efficiency significantly. Finally, the ISAR images of the target-snow-soil scene with different parameters are simulated.

In order to be able to evaluate the potential of the new bands fully, propagation models for V2V communications at such frequencies are needed. Therefore, this article reports new V2V propagation measurements and their modeling results. In particular, we propose a double slope double shadowing model as the most accurate one, based on a comparison of various models using the Bayesian information criteria. We also investigate the space–time autocorrelation properties of shadowing, which turned out to be dependent on the speed of vehicles.

An analysis of the distribution of the unit cells along the horn antenna has been carried out to achieve the desired equivalent refractive indices. By changing the hole radius, different equivalent refractive indices can be tuned with a wideband performance. This fact enables the implementation of a collimation zone inside the horn antenna which transforms the pseudocircular wavefront into a quasi-planar one in the radiating aperture. The produced directivity is similar to the horn antenna with the optimum dimensions, but a longitudinal reduction of 53.7% and a higher realized gain are achieved. A holey SIW horn antenna is designed and manufactured. The measured results show an impedance bandwidth performance below −10 dB from 34.3 to 44.5 GHz (25.9%) with a realized gain above 10 dBi.

They adopt the same scheme of combining a linearly polarized (LP) bidirectional source and two polarizers of the same type. Different polarizers, a single-slab dielectric polarizer (Ant 1) and a linearly tapered slot polarizer (Ant 2), are proposed and applied for them, respectively. The LP source adopts a circular waveguide-based structure. By altering the orthogonal degenerate modes in the waveguide, the CP states can be switched correspondingly. To validate the design ideas, prototypes of the two antennas are fabricated and tested.

The phase shifts are initially determined from an offset feed source to make the corresponding TA antenna radiate a tilted beam with high gain. The phase shifts are asymmetric and can be broadly divided into dominant and ordinary phase shifts with respect to the offset feed source. By mirroring the dominant phase shifts to make the phase shifts symmetric, it can enable symmetric radiation beams for symmetric offset feed sources and improve phase error. When the offset feed source is moving inward to steer the main beam, the phase error of the phase-shifting surface with respect to the feed source starts to occur, while the electric-field spillover/illumination from the feed source is improved, which can maintain the gains of scanning beams. To verify the validity of the concept, the performance of a beam-steerable TA antenna enabled by the offset unifocal phase symmetry has been simulated and compared with the counterparts of unifocal and bifocal beam-steerable TA antennas. The measured results agree well with the simulated ones, revealing that the beam-steerable TA antenna enabled by the offset unifocal phase symmetry can maintain realized gains of scanning beams, suppress sidelobe levels, and reduce gain roll-off within the beam-scanning coverage. The offset unifocal phase symmetry, in principle, is a generalized approach and applicable to reflectarray antennas to improve the beam-steerable performance as well.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3218942","Innovationsfonden Project of MARS2; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9941197","Bifocal;gain roll-off;offset unifocal phase symmetry;sidelobe level;transmitarray (TA) antenna","Antenna feeds;Antennas;Antenna measurements;Lighting;Gain;Transmitting antennas;Reflector antennas","","24","","27","IEEE","8 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The equivalent capacitance, and thus the transmission coefficient of the metamaterial unit cell, can be tuned by external biasing voltages. The metamaterial unit cell couples to the transverse magnetic (TM) field, making it easy to be embedded into waveguide-fed structures such as microstrip lines or parallel-plate waveguides. In addition, it is individually addressable, which meets the design requirement of DMAs. Experimental results show that the transmission coefficient of the metamaterial unit cell can be continuously tuned from −2.7 to −6.5 dB at 29 GHz with a biasing voltage swinging from 2.5 to 10 Vrms.

It is based on the complex-valued deep convolutional neural networks (DConvNets) comprising an encoder network and a corresponding decoder network with pixel-wise regression layer. The encoder network takes the incident EM wave and the contrast (permittivity) distribution of the object as the input. It channels the processed data into the corresponding decoder network to predict the total EM field due to the scatter of the input incident EM wave. The training of the proposed DConvNets is done using the simple synthetic dataset. Due to its strong approximation capability, the proposed DConvNets can realize the prediction of EM field. Hence, the proposed DL-based EMF solver acts as a “inhomogeneous” transformation—the unknown EM field in the objective domain is obtained through the transformation from the information of the incident EM field and the distribution of contrasts (permittivities). Compared with conventional methods, the EMF problem can be solved with higher accuracy and significantly reduced CPU time. Numerical examples have demonstrated the feasibility of this newly proposed approach. This newly proposed DL-based EMF solver presents a new alternative to electromagnetic computation approaches.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3216920","Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:GRF 17207114,GRF 17210815); Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development (AOARD)(grant numbers:FA2386-17-1-0010); NSFC(grant numbers:61271158); Hong Kong UGC(grant numbers:AoE/P–04/08); HKRGC GRF(grant numbers:12306616,12200317,12300218,12300519,17201020,17209918); Fellowship Award from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:HKU PDFS2122-7S05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9933374","Convolutional neural network;deep learning (DL);electromagnetic forward (EMF) process;real time","Mathematical models;Decoding;Electromagnetics;Computational modeling;Training;Three-dimensional displays;Real-time systems","","16","","42","IEEE","31 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The misrepresentation arises when auxiliary grid-based interaction matrices,  $\mathbf {G}$ , of smaller dimensions are used to replace  $\mathrm {Z}^{\mathrm {os}}$  to accelerate their LRA. Specifically, a recently introduced fast multilevel LRA algorithm, which uses truncated singluar-value decompositions of matrices corresponding to interactions between basis-functions and proxy grids, is shown to lose error controllability when used for vector basis/testing functions. A pre-processing stage that correctly and automatically sets the algorithm’s truncation threshold,  $\tau _{\mathcal {G}}$ , for  $\mathbf {G}$ , such that the domains of their truncated versions represent those of the blocks to the desired accuracy, is proposed. The method first analyzes small, randomly sampled portions of  $\mathbf {G}$  and  $\mathrm {Z}^{\mathrm {os}}$ , increasing the sample size until their spectrums converge; it then uses the converged spectra to gradually increase the rank and lower the truncation threshold, until the desired error level is achieved.

Then, the intersecting curve is parametrized in terms of one of the barycentric coordinates of the high-order triangle.

However, due to the propagation of the scattered waves, the continuous-domain binary images are convolved with a so-called point-spread function (PSF) before being digitized by means of sampling. As the 2-D PSF is both nonseparable and nonvanishing in the case of MMW imaging, exact recovery is quite complicated. In this communication, we propose a deep-learning approach for image reconstruction. We should highlight that the wave scatterings are suitably represented with complex-valued quantities, while standard deep neural networks (DNNs) accept real-valued inputs. To overcome this challenge, we separate the real and imaginary parts as if we had two imaging modalities and concatenate them to form a real-valued input with a larger size. Fortunately, the network automatically learns how to combine the mutual information between these modalities to reconstruct the final image. Among the advantages of the proposed method are improved robustness against additive noise and mismatch errors of imaging frequency and object to antenna distance; indeed, the method works well in wideband imaging scenarios over a wide range of objects to antenna distances even in the presence of high noise levels without requiring a separate calibration stage. We test the method with synthetic data simulated with software as well as real recordings in the laboratory.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3210690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9912307","Deep neural networks (DNNs);inverse problem;millimeter-wave (MMW) imaging;reconstruction;wideband imaging","Imaging;Image reconstruction;Training;Antenna measurements;Deep learning;Neural networks;Transceivers","","8","","28","IEEE","5 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This communication presents an mm-wave imaging method with an inverse approach intended for NDT of singly curved composite panels with sparsely distributed flaws. It builds on previous work which was limited to imaging on planar panels. The move from planar to singly curved panels increases the applicability of the method for aerospace applications. The imaging method is reference-free due to a numerical source separation algorithm and exploits sparsity in the reconstruction of scatterers. It is demonstrated using near-field measurements at 60 GHz of an industrially manufactured composite panel with deliberate flaws. Compared to a more traditional Fourier imaging method, our method generates images with higher resolution and higher dynamic range. Flaw detection is also easier using our method as it generates images with less background clutter.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3211341","Försvarsmakten; Försvarets materielverk; National Aeronautics Research Program; VINNOVA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9913883","Image reconstruction;inverse problems;microwave imaging;nondestructive testing (NDT);source separation","Imaging;Antenna measurements;Antennas;Image reconstruction;Source separation;Geometry;Synthetic aperture radar","","9","","31","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
