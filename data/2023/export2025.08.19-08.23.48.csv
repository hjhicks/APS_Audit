Herein, the electric dipole patch and a half-wavelength radiating slot are excited in phase on the patch layer by a substrate-integrated coaxial line (SICL) to fulfill the complementary conditions as an ME dipole. The proposed antenna omits the deployment of the vertically oriented shorted patch, which relieves the typical quarter-wavelength height constraint and fabrication complexity of the conventional ME dipole antennas. The antenna is further loaded with the capacitive reactive impedance surface (RIS) to achieve size miniaturization and bandwidth enhancement. The finalized dimension (excluding the RIS) is  $0.36\,\,\lambda _{0} \times 0.48\,\,\lambda _{0} \times 0.13\,\,\lambda _{0}$ , where  $\lambda _{0}$  denotes the wavelength in free space at the center frequency. A wide impedance bandwidth of 64.8% (17.1–33.5 GHz) is achieved for SWR  $\le2$ , in which the antenna gain varies from 5.9 to 8.8 dBi.

The dynamic antenna supports a constantly and rapidly changing current distribution that generates a radiation pattern that is static in a desired direction and dynamic elsewhere. This imparts additional modulation on the signal and obscures information transmitted or received outside of the information beam, thus achieving directional modulation. Dynamic currents are supported by a single feed that is switched between separate ports on a single antenna, generating two different radiation patterns without changing the physical shape of the antenna. We introduce the theoretical concept by exploring an ideal complex dynamic radiation pattern that remains static in a narrow desired direction and is dynamic elsewhere. The impact on the transmission of information is analyzed, showing that the information beam narrows as the modulation order increases, and design constraints on the spatial width of the information beam as a function of modulation format are determined. We design and analyze a 2.3-GHz two-state dynamic dipole antenna and experimentally demonstrate secure wireless transmission. We demonstrate the ability to change the information beamwidth and steer the information beam experimentally in real time, and to maintain high throughput in the information beam while obscuring the information elsewhere. In contrast to multiport or array-based antennas, our approach introduces a novel rapidly switched single-element technique for secure wireless applications that can be used independently of the rest of the wireless system, essentially operating as a “black box” for an additional layer of security.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3288013","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2028736); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10161710","Directional modulation;dynamic antenna;fast switching;physical layer security;secure wireless communications;switched antenna","Wireless communication;Directive antennas;Modulation;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays;Communication system security;Wireless sensor networks","","2","","25","IEEE","23 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Next, a two-stage ANN framework composed of two encoders and a universal decoder is established to optimize the equivalent excitation, and then a single-input single-output (SISO) sinc−1-ANN is proposed to solve inverse of  $\text {sinc}\left ({\cdot }\right)$  efficiently. To achieve fast and accurate pattern prediction, the decoder is pretrained to be a real-time array analyzer, while the encoder is designed as an array synthesizer to develop online training. By minimizing the loss function related to radiation pattern and equivalent excitation, the desired pattern can be achieved. Then, with the help of the pretrained SISO sinc−1-ANN, the static excitation coefficient, switch-on duration, and starting time are acquired.

Some methods such as loading frequency selective surface (FSS) to the low band (LB) radiator have been proposed, but they inevitably affect the performance of the LB antenna. To solve this problem, this article proposes a systematic method to design LB spatial-filtering antenna (spatial filtenna), which can efficiently suppress the HB blockage effect and maintain LB performance. The design method and equivalent circuits of the LB spatial filtenna element are presented and analyzed. The prototype circuits are proposed to realize a first-order bandpass spatial-filtering response at HB and not affect the LB antenna, resulting in a low HB blockage effect and maintaining LB performance. To realize the prototype circuit, a unit cell including a slot unit and tuner is incorporated into the LB radiator. Based on the proposed method, a dual-band aperture-shared base-station antenna array operating at 0.69–0.96 GHz and 3.0–4.2 GHz is designed. The LB element has a low-profile characteristic, high suppression on HB blockage effect, and good performance to satisfy the requirement of the base-station array antenna.

The antenna comprises a receiver and transmitter (R/T) metasurface above a waveguide-integrated metal plate reflector. By controlling the orientations of the R/T elements, the metasurface can simultaneously and independently manipulate its reflection and transmission of electromagnetic (EM) wavefronts under opposite-handed CP incidences. The reflection mode of the metasurface, together with the bottom reflector, is used to confine the EM waves for multiple reflections, thereby reducing the antenna profile. In particular, the antenna profile-to-focal length ratio can be significantly reduced to less than the conventional FTA of one-third. Meanwhile, the transmission mode of the metasurface is devoted to compensating for the spatial phase delay to generate a high-gain beam. As a proof-of-concept, an FTA prototype with  $19\times 19$  elements was modeled and fabricated with its profile reduced to one-fifth of the focal length.

However, designing wideband, multiband, or high-frequency RRAs faces great challenges, especially the lengthy simulation time due to the lack of systematic design guidance. The current scattering viewpoint of the RRA element, which couples antenna structures and switches during the design process, fails to address these issues. Here, we propose a novel radiation viewpoint to model, evaluate, and design RRA elements. Using this viewpoint, the design goal is to match the element impedance to a characteristic impedance pre-calculated by switch parameters, allowing various impedance matching techniques developed in classical antennas to be applied in RRA element design. Furthermore, the theoretical performance limit can be predetermined at given switch parameters before designing specific structures, and the constant loss curve is suggested as an intuitive tool to evaluate element performance in the Smith chart. The proposed method is validated by a practical 1-bit RRA element with degraded switch parameters. Then, a 1-bit RRA element with wideband performance is successfully designed using the proposed design process. The proposed method provides a novel perspective of RRA elements and offers systematic and effective guidance for designing wideband, multiband, and high-frequency RRAs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3301609","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700201); ZTE Industry-Academia-Research Cooperation Funds; XPLORER PRIZE; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10213421","1 bit;metasurfaces;microwave network theory;reconfigurable intelligent surfaces;reconfigurable reflectarray antennas (RRAs)","Freeports;Reflection;Impedance;Antennas;Reflection coefficient;Wideband;Reflector antennas","","11","","21","IEEE","8 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, an excellent dual-band SISL filtering antenna with broadside radiation is achieved, resulting in high selectivity and deep stopband rejection. To further integrate filtering response and dual band with different radiations, a dual-band SISL filtering antenna with broadside and bidirectional beams is realized. Two RNs are introduced near the upper passband with bidirectional beams by folded C-shaped slots and parasitic strips, and the bidirectional beam is formed by inverted currents on both patches. Moreover, by connecting a T-shaped metal strip with both patches through metallized vias, an extra RN is acquired near the lower passband with broadside beams.

Yet for the first time, the proposed filtering dipole antenna can simultaneously introduce two reflection coefficients zeros and two radiation nulls with only one simple parasitic element. It is theoretically proved that with electrical and magnetic couplings to the odd and even modes of the parasitic element, two radiation nulls can be introduced at both the lower and upper stopbands.

The position of each array element follows a Bernoulli distribution, resulting in a radiation far-field of the TMA being described by a Gaussian distribution. Theoretical analysis of the statistical model shows that the TMA signal is made up of two components: the first accurately carries baseband information related to the mean pattern, while the second introduces artificial noise whose power corresponds to the variance of the radiation far field. This noise could prevent eavesdroppers, situated in any direction besides the desired receiver, from effectively intercepting the transmitted data.

The back lobe of the backfire -3rd SH is used to enhance the endfire gain in the “invisible space” of the -1st SH. The number of loaded dipoles is then analyzed, and it is found that the antenna with four-dipole features a quasi-oscillatory dispersion characteristic. Consequently, the phase curve shows a flatter slope against frequency for -1st SH, which is conducive to achieving a wideband property. Finally, some significant parameters are studied to improve the  $S_{11}$  and the front-to-back (F/B) ratio of the antenna. The prototype of the proposed glide-symmetric antenna was fabricated, and the measured results show that an exact endfire beam is achieved in both E- and H-plane over the band of 7.8–11.2 GHz. The F/B ratio is beyond 10 dB in most of the bands, except for 9.5–10 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3304051","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971453); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1806301); Fundamental and Applied Basic Research Project of Guangzhou(grant numbers:2023A04J1036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10220084","Front-to-back (F/B) ratio;high-gain;periodic leaky wave antenna (PLWA);space harmonic (SH);wideband","Permittivity;Dipole antennas;Wideband;Harmonic analysis;Dispersion;Leaky wave antennas;Loaded antennas","","7","","23","IEEE","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A robust receiver capable of effectively capturing random signals from diverse environments is of utmost importance. To address this, we propose a multi-polarization wideband rectenna design, which integrates a novel symmetrical five-port hybrid-ring coupler and highly efficient Class-F rectifier in a compact manner. Due to the high symmetry between the ring coupler and the antenna, the impedance bandwidth (IBW) ( $S_{11} < -10$  dB) and the axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) (AR < 3 dB) of the rectenna is highly coincident for different polarization methods, thereby effectively improving the operational stability and robustness of the multi-polarization rectenna. Our design has demonstrated over 46.3% operational bandwidth (4.12–6.6 GHz) and over 10% circular polarization (CP) bandwidth. The wireless power receiving port has more than 55.6% (up to 76.5%) conversion efficiency over a power dynamic range of 0–10 dBm, while the optimal power routing of different ports can be obtained via the adjustment of the five-port coupler. Our wideband receiver excels in robust signal reception of arbitrary polarization waves, making it suitable for a range of real-world application scenarios in WSN and industrial IoT. It enables optimal power routing and efficient wireless powering, enhancing the overall performance of future WSNs and IoT applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3306182","King’s College London (KCL) Starting Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10226504","Information and power distribution;multi-polarization;rectenna;rectifiers;simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)","Rectennas;Couplers;Antennas;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Rectifying circuits;Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","","20","","37","IEEE","22 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, control over reflection direction is possibly the most useful. Extensive research has been done in the field of anomalous reflectors over the past years, resulting in numerous introduced geometries and several distinct design approaches. Without a comprehensive comparison between design methods, it is difficult to properly select the most appropriate method and the most suitable metasurface geometry. Here, we consider four main approaches that can be used to design anomalous reflectors for large deviations from specular reflection within the same basic structure topology for microwave and millimeter-wave applications. These approaches include the phase-gradient design, which is well-suited for small deviation angles due to its simplicity in design and realization. The second and third approaches involve optimization-based methods at the level of input and grid impedances, respectively. The fourth method is a non-local approach that optimizes supercells of the structure. We analyze and discuss a wide range of performance aspects, such as the power efficiency and losses, angular response, and the scattering pattern of finite-size structures.

An RIS is produced by arranging reflective elements with control elements in an array. Because no amplifiers or other devices are used, it can be achieved with lower power consumption and cost than other methods, such as relays. However, because a large area of the RIS is required for area improvement, the number of control elements increases, and power consumption and cost may not decrease. Therefore, in this article, we propose a subarray element type RIS in which two reflective elements are controlled by a single control component to achieve low power consumption. We show that a staggered arrangement is an efficient arrangement of reflective elements that can suppress the reduction of the reflection angle range by subarraying and that a specific design method for a subarray element.

In addition, an extra set of HO mono-polar basis functions are introduced to account for the normal component of the current at the mesh discontinuities between adjacent subdomains. The current continuity is then weakly enforced by the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation with interior penalty (IP) terms, which can be derived based on the half-space Green’s function.

The model is based on multitask learning (MTL) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with attention mechanism and residual connection. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MTL SR model could achieve fairly good performances in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and standard deviation of error (STDE). The advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated in comparison with other state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models and visualization of SR performances. The ablation study also proved the necessity of data augmentation and the techniques in the model design. The good generalizability of the proposed MTL SR model leads to discussions of potential applications.

Wireless cable solution, which can achieve traditional cabled testing functionality OTA, has attracted great attention from industry, standardization, and academia in recent years for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) device performance testing. In state-of-the-art wireless cable solutions, the compensation of the transfer matrix between the OTA probes and antenna ports of the device under test (DUT) is implemented with the help of radio channel emulators (CEs). However, the radio CEs are not customized for such implementations, leading to expensive systems and a waste of valuable CE resources. Employing more probe antennas is a known and effective strategy to improve the robustness and quality of the wireless cable connection, which would further increase the system cost with existing implementations. To address these issues, a novel wireless cable implementation employing a stand-alone programmable amplitude and phase control network is proposed. Though simple and cost-effective, the proposed scheme is demonstrated to work in practice, and it is applicable for more generic testing scenarios where a CE is not required. The experiment validation measurements obtained in the vector network analyzer (VNA)-based passive measurement setup as well as in the active measurement setup clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3303992","Project European Partnership on Metrology MEWS(grant numbers:21NRM03); Huawei Technologies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10220074","Antenna testing;channel emulator (CE);over-the-air (OTA) testing;radio channel;wireless cable solution","Antennas;Wireless communication;Testing;Probes;MIMO communication;5G mobile communication;Antenna measurements","","13","","29","IEEE","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a composite resonator (C-Res), serving as both the last-stage resonator of a waveguide filter and an aperture antenna, is utilized to realize a filtering linearly polarized (LP) antenna. The fourth-order electric cross-coupling topology is employed to generate two radiation nulls at both sides of the passband, enhancing the selectivity. Then, a polarizer is presented and placed in front of the LP antenna to obtain the CP radiation. The operating principles of the polarizer are analyzed in detail, which features flexible size and insensitivity to the original filtering response. To demonstrate the concept, three filtering CP antennas with different polarizer dimensions are designed, exhibiting similar responses.

A uniplanar pixel antenna is first utilized to demonstrate the method due to its strong reconfigurability and clear modal behaviors. Reactive loads between the pixels are optimized, which lead to different CMs of the structure. By establishing and solving the multiobjective functions, a uniplanar filtering antenna is successfully obtained, providing flat gains within the passband and high band rejections within the stop bands. As a typical terminal device, a filtering handset antenna is then investigated and synthesized. With the aid of the reactive loads, the filtering features are well integrated into the handset, with the antenna fully conformal to the platform.

A novel compact 2-bit phasing scheme is first proposed and illustrated by utilizing the resonating characteristics of resonators. The charging and discharging principle of a resonator is utilized to realize a 180° phase shift, while J-invertor originating from the coupling between resonators is utilized to realize a 90° phase shift. Based on the proposed phasing scheme, novel 2-bit compact filtering unit cells are designed with a compact four-copper-layer configuration. Finally, a high-gain TA antenna was designed, fabricated, and measured for radiation performance verification. Due to the elaborately designed unit cells and the cutoff effect of the feed horn, a filtering radiation performance with flat in-band gain and high out-of-band suppressions is obtained. Measured results show that a flat 3-dB gain bandwidth of 21.3% is achieved with a thin thickness of  $0.11\lambda _{0}$ . High suppressions of 34.3 and 30.1 dB are measured over the lower and upper out-of-bands.

Typically, each slot of the linear array and each stage of the power divider should be carefully modulated to satisfy the requirements on the amplitude of the low SLL in both E- and H-planes. However, for a slot array at W-band or higher, the varied slot distribution and the unequal feeding network are very sensitive even to the slightest inaccuracy of each parameter, which makes it very challenging to distinguish the expected amplitudes within the constraints of fabrication resolution. Meanwhile, it will take a very long iteration optimization time and the SLL performance is sensitive to the frequency, i.e., the operating bandwidth is very narrow. In this communication, a simple and effective method, by only reversing the offset direction of partial slots, to reduce the SLL in two planes for a W-band substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) slot array antenna with expanded bandwidth is proposed. For the SIW slot array, 0°/180° radiation phase can be easily achieved by placing adjacent slots on the opposite and same side without changing the length and offset of the slots. This feature is applied to optimize the SLL of the SIW slot array in two planes with the improved greedy algorithm. In this case, delicate and susceptible varying slot distribution and unequal power dividers are substituted by simply reversing a portion of radiating slots. Finally, a  $16\times16$  low SLL SIW slot array antenna prototype with extended bandwidth is designed. The measured results exhibit a −19.1 dB low SLL at 94 GHz. The presented lightweight, low-loss, and high-integration W-band SIW slot array with low SLL provides good promise in the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) SAR imaging application.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3301948","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62101109); Hong Kong Scholars Program(grant numbers:XJ2022031); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021TQ0058,2021M690026); Joint Foundation of Research in advance and Ministry of Education (MOE)(grant numbers:8091B042113); National Defense Pre-Research Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214248","Low sidelobe level (SLL);slot array antenna;substrate integrated waveguide (SIW);W-band","Antenna arrays;Slot antennas;Power dividers;Bandwidth;Fabrication;Optimization;Manganese","","19","","28","IEEE","9 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this communication, a broadband active dual probe with two LNAs is proposed as a high-performance near-field detection tool for the first time. For broadband passive dual probe, a strictly symmetric structure is required. However, the symmetry of the active dual probe is difficult to achieve due to many factors, such as redundant transmission structure and asymmetric LNA chip. Therefore, an asymmetric calibration method (ACM) is adopted to eliminate the effects of the asymmetric structure, which can broaden the operating frequency of the active dual probe. Besides, a characterization method of sensitivity for the active dual probe is presented with an independent source. By analyzing the relationship between the transfer matrix and the physical size (or time delay) of the asymmetric structure, the calibration results of the active probe by using the ACM have been verified. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of this active dual probe is also verified by comparing the calculation and measurement results. Furthermore, by measuring a standing wave, the proposed active probe is broadened to 12 GHz by the ACM.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3288559","Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan Projects(grant numbers:202201010060); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62001123,62274043); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022A1515012409); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022B0701180002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10167499","Active dual probe;asymmetric calibration;broadband;near-field","Probes;Calibration;Sensitivity;Transmission line measurements;Broadband communication;Magnetic shielding;Magnetic noise","","9","","25","IEEE","27 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The operating principle is to fit and extrapolate the amplitude and phase of the measured complex signals, which are envisaged to have a parabola shape, after compensation using the known probe radiation pattern and the free space transfer function.
