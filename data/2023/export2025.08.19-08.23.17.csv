However, the design of the SSPP-based array antennas requires significant efforts because of multiple specifications, the high cost of electromagnetic (EM) evaluations, and a large number of design parameters. This article proposes a multisurrogate-assisted optimization framework for the efficient design of SSPP-based mmWave array antennas. The framework has three stages. In each stage, a surrogate is proposed to solve a specific task. The first stage is to find the initial values of four key design parameters using artificial neural network (ANN)-based surrogate model optimization. The second stage focuses on the optimization of sidelobe level based on another ANN surrogate model. The third stage is a beamforming-focused optimization procedure using the space mapping technique with an improved array factor formula as a surrogate. An mmWave SSPP-based array antenna with 16 circular patches at a central frequency of 28 GHz is successfully designed using the proposed framework. The antenna is also redesigned for five sets of main lobe directions and null locations at 24 GHz. All antennas are verified using full-wave EM simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3240239","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10035005","Antenna design;optimization;sensitivity analysis;space mapping;surrogate modeling","Antenna arrays;Optimization;Millimeter wave communication;Integrated circuit modeling;Antenna radiation patterns;Brain modeling;Surface impedance","","10","","35","IEEE","1 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A ground plane within the multilayer design separates the antenna array from the electronics array while providing shielding from the back and improving the power coupling into the tissue. The proposed structure resolves an outstanding problem in the design of large shielded antenna arrays for tissue imaging, namely, the interconnects between the array elements and the electronic circuits, which are separated by multiple dielectric layers and a grounded plane. The critical development is the new low-reflection triple-wire vertical transition that carries the signal from the antenna layer to the electronics layer while traversing through multiple layers of different permittivities and through openings in the ground plane.

Such mechanical antennas were shown to be orders of magnitude more efficient than conventional antennas in the extremely low frequency (ELF, 3–3000 Hz) band. However, the signal modulation is constrained by inertia because this mechanical antenna relies on mechanical motion rather than on electromagnetic wave resonance. When using the existing signal modulation methods designed for circuit systems, the performance of the mechanical antenna is limited. Therefore, we presented an inertial compatible modulation method for the mechanical antenna called chirp-rate shift keying (CSK). In CSK modulation, the transmitted data are directly related to the driving torque, which can change instantly regardless of inertia. The orthogonal modulation methods of CSK were also established to achieve optimal detection. To demonstrate the feasibility of CSK modulation, we conducted a wireless communication experiment that used a rotary magnet-based mechanical antenna as the transmitter. The experimental results indicated that CSK modulation requires less torque and can achieve a higher reliable communication rate at the same bit error rate (BER) level compared to conventional frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3240251","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771375,92052106); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10035014","Chirp-rate shift keying (CSK);mechanical antenna;mechanically rotating dipoles;orthogonal modulation method","Modulation;Frequency shift keying;Dipole antennas;Torque;Chirp;Magnetic resonance;Magnetostatics","","14","","30","IEEE","1 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two of the four ports provide +45°-polarized radiation and the other two generate − 45°-polarized radiation. Every port of the proposed antenna is well isolated from the other three ports, enabling simultaneous transmitting (TX) and receiving (RX) with both two polarizations. To achieve this goal, three different types of couplings need to be addressed simultaneously. In this work, a novel isolation feed network is proposed, which is the first of its kind that can achieve three targets at the same time, i.e., feeding the antenna differentially, forming the original horizontal and vertical polarizations into ± 45° polarizations, and canceling out the reflected and coupled signals between the TX and RX ports. Then, a double-antenna IBFD system with four isolated channels is attained by combining the proposed feed network, defected ground structure (DGS), cross-shaped walls, and metal baffles, which effectively mitigated all the three types of couplings at the same time. The double-antenna system has high isolations of  $>$ 39 dB between any two of the four ports from 3.3 to 3.9 GHz. The four radiation patterns obtained by exciting the four ports are very similar to each other and are stable with frequency, which makes it an excellent candidate for 5G sub-6 GHz IBFD applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3241339","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871309,61801346); Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Research Fellowship (DECRA)(grant numbers:DE200101347); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10038698","Dual-polarization;four isolated ports;in-band full-duplex (IBFD);isolation feed network;self-interference cancellation (SIC)","Antennas;Couplings;Interference cancellation;Antenna feeds;Antenna arrays;Transmitting antennas;Gain","","24","","42","IEEE","6 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A series of slots etched on strip conductor around shorting pins are utilized to improve the radiation efficiency of the antenna in addition to its vertical polarization. In this way, the VP endfire LWA can be eventually realized with efficient radiation on a low-profile substrate.

However, the existing MW/MMW shared-aperture antennas are facing challenges in dealing with the interference between two bands and implementing beam steering at both bands. To address these issues, a windowed slow-wave parallel-plate waveguide (WSW-PPW) is proposed as the sharing platform, on which MW and MMW antenna elements can be flexibly arranged. WSW-PPW is implemented by embedding electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures into a dual-layer printed PPW. At the MW band, WSW-PPW exhibits a transmission feature for feeding and also integrating MW antenna elements. At the MMW band, WSW-PPW rejects the propagation of electromagnetic waves and functions as artificial magnetic boundaries for dielectric resonator antennas, which are realized by removing subarrays of EBG structures. For demonstration, an MW/MMW shared-aperture antenna is implemented by integrating a  $1\times $  2 MW patch array and a  $1\times $  8 MMW array on this platform.

A design method of the dual-band OMT considering the requirement for a self-supporting geometry in metallic 3-D printing is presented, so that its compact configuration that is difficult to fabricate by traditional milling technology can be fulfilled conveniently in a whole piece with the use of commercial 3-D printing facilities. A millimeter-wave horn with a small radiation aperture is embedded into a larger aperture of a microwave horn. A proper longitudinal offset between them is introduced to guarantee promising radiation characteristics of the shared-aperture scheme in the two bands.

To overcome this limitation, a new approach is proposed in this article to directly estimate the self- and mutual impedances of two coupled antennas from impedance correlations. The theoretical developments presented are validated experimentally in a reverberation chamber (RC) excited by a single antenna where mechanical and source stirring techniques are combined to generate a sufficiently diffuse field environment.

Different from the conventional Huygens topology, both the monopole-like Huygens form and the metamaterial loading technique are explored for size reduction. By creatively tuning the direction (or polarization) of the electric dipole (E-dipole) or magnetic dipole (M-dipole), a novel miniaturized pattern reconfigurable Huygens source is first proposed. Then, to control the polarization of the M-dipole [linearly polarized (LP)], a double circularly polarized (CP) wave with a tunable phase difference is introduced. Furthermore, a novel phase-controlled Huygens mechanism is developed by combining the polarization reconfigurable M-dipole and fixed E-dipole. By modulating the feeding phase of the Huygens source, the beam can be steered in any direction in the horizontal plane. The proposed theory and working principle are verified by a metamaterial-loaded tri-mode dielectric resonator radiator and a three-way phase-shifting network. The antenna is operated from 3.40 to 3.68 GHz and is capable of continuously scanning a directional beam from 0° to 360°. The realized peak gain and 3 dB beamwidth are greater than 6.3 dBi and 90°, respectively.

A co-aperture metasurface structure is designed by loading a large square ring surrounded by eight small square patches in the same aperture. By embedding the VO2 film into the large ring, two lower frequencies of 22 and 28 GHz can be excited and switched when the film operates in metallic and insulating states respectively. Meanwhile, an extra higher mode resonance at 40 GHz is produced by the small patches. Benefiting from the reasonable co-aperture layout, the three frequency bands exhibit good independent tunability. Furthermore, the tri-band metasurface structure is used as a radiation element to construct a reconfigurable antenna. To realize good feeding coupling at three bands with a large frequency ratio for the antenna, a new kind of combined slot is proposed and etched on the transverse surface of the feeding waveguide. The combined slot contains a loop slot, a dumbbell-shaped slot, and two U-shaped slots, corresponding to low, medium, and high frequencies, respectively. In addition, a simple coplanar direct current (dc) bias circuit with little effect on radiation is designed. As a result, when the VO2 film is in an insulating state, the antenna can simultaneously cover two bands of 27.7–29.8 and 38.8–40 GHz with a maximum gain of about 8.7 and 9.5 dBi, respectively; when the film is activated to a metallic state, it can also work in two bands of 21.1–21.6 and 38.6–40 GHz with the maximum gain of about 7.2 and 9.3 dBi.

Therefore, beam scanning through time modulation technique could only be realized at harmonic frequencies. In order to achieve low sideband levels (SBLs) in harmonic beam scanning, a large number of modulation statuses are required in TMAs, which significantly increases the cost and complexity of the entire system. The intent of this work is to develop a novel TMA with array-interpolation aperture and ON–OFF time modulation to achieve beam scanning at the carrier frequency. By performing interpolation computation at the antenna array level, high-precision beam scanning with low SBLs can be realized with pseudorandom ON–OFF time modulation and a static 1 bit phase control. Compared with the state-of-the-art designs, the proposed TMA requires much fewer modulation statuses, and it significantly facilitates beam-scanning control. A forward design strategy is presented to analytically determine the time modulation sequences and the static 1 bit phase statuses for specified beam-scanning angles and sidelobe levels (SLLs).

First, the improved filter circuit, consisting of three lumped parameter resonators and stepped impedance, is established by integrating capacitive and inductive coupling second-order circuits. Second, the odd- and even-mode analysis method demonstrates that the filter circuit can excite four transmission poles (TPs). Since the hybrid coupling paths can produce other series resonance, the filter circuit can exhibit four transmission zeros (TZs) in the out-of-band approaching the existing TPs, resulting in a quasi-elliptic filtering response and high out-of-band suppression. Third, two dual-polarized FSSs based on the corresponding circuit models have been designed using a compact hexagonal composite structure.

The metasurface antenna is for the first time used in designing a monostatic STAR antenna system for its compact and wideband characteristics. The proposed STAR antenna system possesses the features of monostatic operation, wide bandwidth, high TX/RX isolation, cocircularly polarized radiation with similar patterns for TX and RX, easy fabrication, and low cost. The metasurface-based STAR antenna is formed by four dual-polarized metasurface antennas, or units, and is used for both TX and RX to achieve monostatic operation. A wide operating bandwidth is obtained for each antenna unit by combining the resonate modes of the unit and a crossed slot, the feeding structure of the unit, using characteristic mode analysis (CMA). To achieve high TX/RX isolation and identical right-handed circular polarization (RHCP), the four TX and RX ports of the STAR antenna, respectively, are excited with equal amplitudes and relative phases of 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, by two dedicated-designed wideband feeding networks based on the sensitivity analysis. Accordingly, the proposed STAR antenna system is prototyped. The measurement results show that the STAR antenna system achieves  $>$ 36 dB TX/RX isolation and <3 dB axial ratio from 4.5 to 6 GHz and maintains similar radiation patterns with the same RHCP for TX and RX.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3243988","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901272,62001157,62001306); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515012288,2021A1515011323); NSAF Joint Fund(grant numbers:U2130102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10045645","Circular polarization;in-band full-duplex (IBFD);metasurface;monostatic;self-interference cancellation (SIC);simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR)","Stars;Metasurfaces;Broadband antennas;Antenna feeds;Wideband;Interference cancellation;Antennas","","16","","40","IEEE","15 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the linear-to-circular polarization converter is constructed to convert two orthogonal linearly polarized (LP) spatial waves split from a 45°-slant incident plane wave into a desired circularly polarized (CP) wave. Taking advantage of the wideband filter synthesis method and phase shifter theory, polarization converter elements with prescribed specifications [e.g., fractional bandwidth (FBW) and Chebyshev passband ripple] are then synthesized by the corresponding low-characteristic-impedance bandpass filtering networks with the loading of shunt short-circuited stubs on quarter-wavelength transmission line (TL) sections. The adjacent-order phase difference function with a natural ±90° value at a center frequency can be simultaneously manipulated by a filtering bandwidth. The theoretical axial ratio (AR) curve is calculated by the synthesized magnitude responses and phase deviation (PD) function. The design guideline is then summarized. Finally, based on the third- and fourth-order bandpass filtering networks, a prototype of the proposed linear-to-circular polarization converter operating at 5 GHz with a designable 70% 3 dB AR bandwidth is implemented, fabricated, and tested by the free-space measurement method. The transmitted CP wave with three in-band AR minima and relatively stable angular performances can be efficiently converted from the incident LP spatial wave as well verified in the experiment.

A particularly intriguing choice is the exact magnetic-to-electric (MtE) operator as a regularizer. But, evaluating this operator is as expensive as solving the original EFIE. In work by El Bouajaji, Antoine, and Geuzaine, approximate local MtE surface operators for the time-harmonic Maxwell equation were proposed. These can be efficiently evaluated through the solution of sparse problems. This article demonstrates the preconditioning properties of these approximate MtE operators for the EFIE.

In this article, we propose to instead adopt the principled framework of Bayesian inference to conduct inference for the SV model. The posterior distribution is not analytically tractable and we therefore compute approximations of the posterior using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods specific to point processes. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we additionally propose a new multipath model and apply our inference method to it.

Detailed characterization of the fire impact in terms of excess loss due to the yielded plumes at UHF frequencies, mainly in the L-band, when considering two different ignition sources, is also presented. The implemented small-scale fire scenario is composed of a 1  $\times 1$  m metallic grid covered with a 0.6 kg pine needle fuel bed that was placed right above a circular and linear gas burner to mimic an underbrush scenario. The propagation phenomena were evaluated through specific wideband measurements as the fire developed while intersecting the radio path at the antennas’ boresight. Results demonstrate changes in the propagation medium that is strongly influenced by the plume, which ultimately becomes (partly) ionized. Deep fades of up to 12 dB below median levels at specific frequencies during a short period of time, when the fire is more intense, were measured. We also obtained an overall median excess loss due to fire of up to 2 dB in the frequency range from 0.6 to 2 GHz in a relatively short path (below 1 m). A time-domain analysis allowed us to expand these results yielding fading values of the direct component of more than 3 dB in the presence of fire. Extending the findings presented in this article to a real-scale fire scenario, in which median excess loss of more than 20 dB and deeper nulls are ought to be expected, sets the rationale and motivation to pursue future work on the topic, with practical relevance to future mission-critical communication networks planning, such as, but not limited to, LTE Public-Safety and specific 5G use cases.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3238130","Portuguese Government, Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through the project RESCuE-TOOL(grant numbers:PCIF/SSI/0194/2017,UID/EEA/50008/2021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025692","Attenuation;ionization;radiowave propagation;wildfire","Fuels;Ionization;Combustion;Attenuation;Furnaces;Antenna measurements;Needles","","3","","23","CCBY","24 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The physics prediction models show some limitations in practice. This article proposes a data-driven PL prediction method based on the gated recurrent unit network (GRU-PL). An X-band EM propagation system was developed and deployed for one month to collect PL of a 53 km link in the South China Sea for model training and testing. The GRU-PL model uses the air-sea variables as inputs and outputs the predicted PL. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the GRU-PL model is 7.04 dB, decreasing by 57.2% compared with the classical method. Furthermore, a method, which uses the inversion evaporation duct heights (EDHs) as the output to train the GRU network and then uses the parabolic equation model to predict the PL based on the GRU predicted EDHs, is also discussed.

To avoid wasting time in treating the model by manual operation such as traditional methods, DVESBR utilizes a new ray-tracing strategy to ensure correct boundary conditions. In this new ray-tracing strategy, space partitioning data structure construction and ray-tracing processes for the sea and for each target are independent. In addition, because the draft is greater than zero, the ship is partially embedded in the sea. For this type of 3-D scene, its scattering problem has not been solved. To overcome this difficulty, DVESBR fills the entire space with ray tubes, and then, the scattering of a 3-D scene is converted to the sum of the scattering of all ray tubes. Volume equivalent physical optics (VEPO) is proposed and combined with VESBR to analyze the infinite- and finite-length ray tube conditions.

In this work, a new polarimetric passive calibrator is proposed, which is designed as quarter concave cylinder linked dihedral (QCCLD). The backscattering of a single QCCLD contains both depolarizing and nondepolarizing components when rotating along the radar line of sight (LOS). This unique characteristic makes it an excellent polarimetric calibrator, which allows fully polarimetric calibration of a nonreciprocal radar system by measuring just a single QCCLD. The theoretical polarimetric scattering matrix (PSM) is derived based on physical optics (PO). Using complex exponential (CE) model-based parametric representation, a novel polarimetric calibration procedure is developed to suppress undesirable scattering components, which degrade the calibration accuracy.

Recently, a new finite-range integral representation of the SI has been proposed, whose integrand is written in terms of the SI for an impedance half-plane. Based on the known complete nonuniform asymptotic expansion of the SI for an impedance half-plane, the complete nonuniform asymptotic expansion can be analytically formulated for the dielectric half-space. Moreover, the completeness is mathematically proven such that the expansion satisfies the recurrence relation for the Wilcox expansion.

However, in the oblique incidence case, the problem cannot be handled as a scalar problem by considering only one field component, namely,  $E_{\text {z}}$  for a TMz plane wave. Accordingly, all components of both the electric and magnetic field vectors are involved in the procedure and at each layer, and they are expressed as series of cylindrical functions with unknown coefficients. These coefficients are determined through the solution of a linear system of equations, which is constructed by first enforcing the continuity of the tangential components of the electric and magnetic field vectors on each boundary between the layers, then expressing the cylindrical functions in these continuity relations as Fourier series, and using the orthogonality of complex exponentials.

However, the path of secure data transmission by THz links is facing many complex challenges. Of that, scattering-induced eavesdropping threat remains one of the most critical but less explored. With the updating of carrier frequency into the THz range, the wavelength becomes comparable to the surface roughness of typical objects in our daily life. Surface scattering, which is negligible in current wireless networks, becomes serious and would lead to desperate signal eavesdropping. For a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) link achieved by surface reflection, how does the scattering affect link security at the physical layer? Such direct information is crucial for the inspection of security threats and proposing of possible solutions. Using metallic wavy surfaces, we characterize possibilities of signal eavesdropping caused by bistatic scattering, by several unmodulated channels at different frequencies.

In the HM, we use a library of T-matrices and the Foldy–Lax (FL) equation to calculate the electromagnetic field interactions outside of the cylinders enclosing the individual plants. To improve CPU time and memory requirements, the FL equation is solved by a triplet of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) consisting of two FFTs solving 2-D FFTs of spatial distribution of plants and one 1-D FFT for solving the transformation of the order of cylindrical waves in the translation addition theorem. The triple FFTs minimize the CPU time and the memory requirement for computing translation addition matrix, which has been the bottleneck of large-scale simulations in the HM. To account for nonperiodic distribution of scatterers in a corn field, the premultiplication and the postmultiplication processes were applied to the FHM. The proposed method is validated at L-band (1.4 GHz) for 100 corn plants of height 1.25 m occupying an area of 9.54 by 9.54  $\text{m}^{2}$ . On a standard laptop, the CPU time is less than 6 min and the memory consumption is less than 710 Mbytes.

The dense media are computer-generated by applying the bicontinuous random media characterization. The microstructure of the media is controlled by two parameters: mean grain size  $\langle \zeta \rangle $  and aggregation parameter  ${b}$ . Phase matrices and extinction coefficients are computed with full-wave simulations. These are then substituted into radiative transfer (RT) equations to obtain backscattering coefficients of the dense media layer with particle clusters. The backscattering has a weaker frequency dependence (e.g.,  $\sim $ 2.6 power for  ${b}=\mathbf {0}.\mathbf {4}$ ) than the Rayleigh scattering of fourth power. Backscattering results exhibit strong co-, cross-polarization (pol), and ratio of cross- to co-polarization. For applications to remote sensing of terrestrial snow at C-band, the results of DMRT simulations show that cross-polarization of snow volume scattering can be larger than that of soil surface scattering. Recently, this property of strong cross-polarization has become a useful satellite remote sensing technique for global retrieval of snow depth. Comparisons of DMRT results are made with ESA Satellite Sentinel 1 C-band data and ground-based radar observations.

However, practical channel emulation campaigns tend to use a limited number of random drops due to limited time budget and hardware capacity constraint, which may cause the emulated spatial correlation to be deviated from the expected one due to the loss of ergodicity. In this article, the properties of the emulated channel under the PFS method are reexamined for a given set of initial subpath phases that are randomly configured at different probes. The analytical expressions of the spatial–temporal correlation function (STCF) are thus derived by averaging over time, compared with the general manipulations of ensemble averaging in the literature. Our derivations indicate that the spatial correlation function (SCF) of the emulated channel may deviate from the expected form for a given set of initial subpath phases in the classic PFS method. An improved configuration method for initial subpath phases is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reproduce the exact SCF in any random drop while unaffecting other important channel properties, for example, the temporal correlation function (TCF).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3235005","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971067); State Major Science and Technology Special Projects(grant numbers:2018ZX03001028-003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10016304","Channel emulation;over-the-air (OTA);prefaded signal synthesis (PFS);spatial correlation function (SCF);temporal correlation function (TCF)","Probes;Antennas;Testing;Correlation;MIMO communication;Anechoic chambers;Transfer functions","","2","","20","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The midstrips are designed as parallel resonators and play the key role of current polarizing of the dipole currents. At the presence of the midstrips, the cross currents on the dipole surface are polarized out of phase and cancel each other, improving radiation-polarization purity consequently.

Furthermore, the open stopbands (OSBs) in both bands are suppressed by adding matching stubs and arranging the radiating slots in corrugation, so that the continuous beam scanning from backward to forward can be obtained. The ultra-wideband linear source generator based on substrate-integrated coaxial line (SICL) is subsequently designed to support the radiating structure. For validation, a prototype operating at both 13–20 and 25–37 GHz is implemented.

Elevation scanning can be achieved by a linear displacement of the feed in the focal plane parallel to the aperture of diameter D. When designing compact terminals with a short focal length F and with high gain, the aberrations caused by this mechanical movement become the main limiting factor for the maximum scanning range. This work presents a novel design method for devising the TA phase correction with an even distribution of these aberrations among all beam directions. A significant improvement in the scanning performance is achieved when compared with the conventional single-focus phase correction approach. To validate the proposed approach, we consider a TA design at the Ka-band (30 GHz) F/D  $\cong ~0.34$ . A multifocal TA design was manufactured using 3-D printed unit cells.

The BPRC is composed of three-layer metal patches, three-layer dielectric substrates, and p-i-n diodes. When the p-i-n diodes are in the OFF-state, the LP and CP incident waves can be converted into cross-polarization and co-polarization reflected waves, respectively. Whereas when the p-i-n diodes are changed from OFF-state to ON-state, the LP and CP incident waves can be converted into co-polarization and cross-polarization reflected waves, respectively. The conversion ratio is higher than −1 dB in the frequency range of 7.4–12 GHz, with a relative bandwidth of 47.4%.
