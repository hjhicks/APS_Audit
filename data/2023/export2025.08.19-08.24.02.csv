Advancements in CEM rely on those in mathematical representation of physical problems, numerical foundations of methods and algorithms, and computing hardware and software infrastructure. Indeed, CEM research and practice demand the seamless but also the most advanced combination of advancements in engineering, physics, mathematics, and computer science, holding immense potential for transformative impact.

The FCC-FDTD method with uniform grids has a smaller numerical dispersion error than the traditional FDTD methods. To further enhance its efficiency and scalability, the NU-FCC-FDTD method is proposed to solve complex electromagnetic problems. Unlike the traditional FDTD methods based on Yee’s grids, for which the nonuniform grid technique is relatively straightforward, instability may occur when trying to apply nonuniform grids into the FCC-FDTD method. To ensure stability, cell-size-based correction factors are carefully defined in the time-marching formulations after taking cell sizes into consideration. Through comprehensive numerical dispersion analysis, the NU-FCC-FDTD method shows numerical dispersion advantage over the FDTD methods and the FCC-FDTD method with uniform grids. Furthermore, the stability condition is also given by using the parameter scanning method and verified in numerical examples. Four examples, including electromagnetic wave propagation, a dielectric rod (DR) resonator, a composite metallic–dielectric radome, and the electromagnetic energy absorption of human head, are carried out to demonstrate its performance. Results show that the proposed NU-FCC-FDTD method can significantly improve the efficiency compared with that of the FCC-FDTD method without compromising accuracy.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3234654","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101020,62141405); Hongque Innovation Foundation(grant numbers:HQ 202102002); COMAC Innovation Research Plan(grant numbers:CIRP202004001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015638","Face-centered cubic (FCC);finite-difference time-domain (FDTD);nonuniform grid;numerical dispersion;stability analysis","Finite difference methods;FCC;Dispersion;Electromagnetics;Power system stability;Time-domain analysis;Numerical stability","","4","","49","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to the global error range corresponding to the preset base order range, the local maximal error in each discretized element is used to determine the allowable local range of the base order. The local error in each element is compared with the local error range to determine which operation, i.e., the base order increasing or decreasing, is implemented. The resulting two error thresholds are insensitive in the dynamic  $p$ - adaptive procedure. When applying the proposed  $p$ - adaptive scheme to the LTS method, a simple grouping approach in terms of the time steps related to the base orders has been developed to rapidly perform the marching-on-in- time procedure. Several numerical examples including scattering from a missile, radiation of a ridge gap waveguide (RGW) antenna, and transmission of a cylindrical cavity filter are given to demonstrate the good accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3228698","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFA1401001); Shaanxi Outstanding Youth Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9991972","Discontinuous Galerkin time domain (DGTD);dual-fold error-driven scheme;grouping approach;local time stepping (LTS);p-adaptive","Method of moments;Error analysis;Time-domain analysis;Transient analysis;Electromagnetics;Magnetic fields;Estimation","","10","","33","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The nonlinear constitutive relation that relates electric flux and electric field induced in the scatterer is used as an auxiliary equation that complements TD-EFVIE. The ordinary differential equation (ODE) system that arises from TD-EFVIE’s Schaubert–Wilton–Glisson (SWG)-based discretization is integrated in time using a predictor–corrector method for the unknown expansion coefficients of the electric field. Matrix systems that arise from the SWG-based discretization of the nonlinear constitutive relation and its inverse obtained using the Padé approximant are used to carry out explicit updates of the electric field and the electric flux expansion coefficients at the predictor and the corrector stages of the time integration method. The resulting explicit marching-on-in-time (MOT) scheme does not call for any Newton-like nonlinear solver and only requires solution of sparse and well-conditioned Gram matrix systems at every step. Numerical results show that the proposed explicit MOT-based TD-EFVIE solver is more accurate than the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method that is traditionally used for analyzing transient electromagnetic scattering from nonlinear objects.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3245301","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR)(grant numbers:2016-CRG5-2953,2019-CRG8-4056); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10049767","Electric field volume integral equation (EFVIE);Kerr nonlinearity;marching-on-in-time (MOT);predictor-corrector scheme;transient analysis","Time-domain analysis;Electric fields;Finite difference methods;STEM;Integral equations;Electromagnetic scattering;Mathematical models","","8","","60","CCBY","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The scheme is presented for the self-term case, i.e., when the observation point is in the source triangle, then extended to the non-self-term cases. To develop the scheme, first, the retarded-time potential integrals on the high-order triangles are reduced to a line integral, which is formed by the intersection of the high-order triangle and a sphere centered at the observation point, then suitable order Gauss–Legendre quadrature rule (GLQR) is applied to evaluate the line integral. It is shown that the resulting scheme does not require any singularity treatment since the integrand of the line integral does not exhibit any singular behavior as time tends to zero. Numerical examples demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed scheme by comparing the time samples of the retarded-time potentials obtained using the proposed scheme and samples obtained in the frequency domain (FD) and then inverse Fourier transformed to the time domain.

To obtain an excitation agnostic approach, our approach generalizes a technique to multiply-connected geometries where the testing of the RHS with loop functions is replaced by a testing of the normal component of the magnetic field with a scalar function. To this end, we leverage orientable global loop functions that are formed by a chain of Rao–Wilton–Glisson (RWG) functions around the holes and handles of the geometry, for which we introduce cap surfaces that allow to uniquely define a suitable scalar function.

The directional sources are constructed by augmenting the conventional basis functions with spherical absorbing 3-D shields, on which auxiliary source distributions are defined. The bottleneck arising from the need to integrate over these distributions upon computing the modified Green’s function (MGF) is removed by using efficient nonuniform sampling and tabulation of the MGF or its components, in a region-dependent manner.

Then we get the face-based functions of zero polynomial order and the volume-based functions of the first order. Functions of arbitrarily high order are obtained by multiplying the vector functions of the lowest order by independent scalar polynomials of higher order. Our face-based functions conform to those of other differently shaped elements to allow the use of hybrid meshes, while the multiplicative construction technique generates right away the volume-based basis functions.

Then, each domain is treated independently, and the coupling to the rest of the object is obtained through the electric and magnetic current densities on the equivalent Huygens’ surfaces (EHSs), surrounding each domain. From the initial solution, the error is estimated on the whole structure, and an adaptive h-refinement is applied accordingly. Both the error estimation and the adaptive h-refined solution are obtained through the defined EHSs, keeping the problem local. The adaptive h-refinement is obtained by a nonconformal submeshing, where multibranch Rao–Wilton–Glisson (MB-RWG) basis functions are defined.

Regarding the finite-element method (FEM) that, unlike the MoM, easily handles an anisotropic and/or highly inhomogeneous environment, a wire feed line can be modeled by a voltage source in the finite-width feed-gap. The input impedance is then obtained from the circulation of the magnetic field on a line around this gap. We show that this method cannot be used for a strip feed line and propose a novel and simple technique to compute the antenna impedance that can be straightforwardly implemented in an FEM numerical code.

However, most of the existing optimization schemes are not efficient and comprehensive when optimizing the S-parameters and radiation patterns of an antenna. This is caused by the high computational cost of EM simulations and the lack of universal antenna parametric models. To address this problem, a rapid optimization scheme based on surrogate-assisted parametric models (SAPMs) is proposed. Different from traditional surrogate-assisted models, the proposed model is utilized for mapping from design parameters to characteristic coefficients of the parametric models. In this way, the EM responses with regard to different design parameters can be predicted. The proposed scheme is implemented by a model-search-valid iteration and further validated on a patch antenna, an SIW cavity-backed slot antenna, and a flat-topped Fabry–Pérot cavity antenna. The validation results indicate that S-parameters and radiation patterns of an antenna can be simultaneously optimized with high efficiency. Compared with relevant works, the optimization efficiency and solution quality of the proposed scheme show a marked promotion, manifesting as the total time cost is significantly reduced to less than 30% and even only 6% of the time required in the state-of-the-art work.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3316673","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071503); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10262237","Antenna optimization;multiobjective optimization;parametric model;surrogate-assisted model","Optimization;Antenna radiation patterns;Scattering parameters;Costs;Parametric statistics;Mathematical models;Computational modeling","","4","","44","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The upper arm forms a hybrid feed mode for the patch radiator, which combines proximity-coupled and probe-fed methods to achieve a passband and two radiation nulls near it. In addition, one additional null is introduced by the coupling scheme of the two arms to achieve a better filtering response. Meanwhile, two shorted stubs are embedded and coupled with the lower arms to improve both the out-of-band and cross-polarization suppression. As a result, a filtering patch antenna operating from 3.3 to 3.77 GHz with a low cross-polarization level of −25 dB and an out-of-band gain suppression of −18 dB is obtained.

By applying a novel technique called “cascaded cavity-based substrate cut-out (CCSC),” we were able to increase the low-frequency gain within an electrically smaller Vivaldi antenna. Because the dielectric material has been removed around cavity locations, the antenna’s overall weight is reduced, giving it a high gain per unit substrate weight/volume. The high-frequency gain of the antenna has been improved with a pixelated bilayer metallic director, which flattens the antenna’s overall gain profile over a wider band range.

Whilst many existing analog multibeam antennas have limited beam forming and steering capabilities, a recently developed generalized joined coupler (GJC) matrix makes it possible to form multiple beams in any direction and steer them independently by tuning the phase shifters. In this work, we propose a novel design method for the GJC matrix by jointly designing both the directional couplers and phase shifters instead of the published coupler-only optimization, thus significantly enhancing the beamforming performance of the GJC matrix. To this end, we derive deterministic solutions to solve the parameters of the directional couplers and phase shifter values beam-by-beam. Specifically, we present algorithms to design Blass-like and Nolen-like GJC matrices. It is further shown that the derived solutions are exact for a full-dimensional Nolen-like GJC matrix to generate orthogonal beams of any dimension. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose an improved architecture for implementing the GJC matrix. Extensive simulation and numerical results are provided to validate the high performance of the proposed designs and their superiority over the prior art in various low-sidelobe beamforming and beam steering scenarios.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3315013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10255616","Analog beamforming network;Blass matrix;Butler matrix;deterministic solutions;generalized joined coupler (GJC) matrix;Nolen matrix","Butler matrices;Manganese;Phase shifters;Directional couplers;Antennas;Symmetric matrices;Array signal processing","","5","","25","IEEE","19 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the Rx antenna is located in front of the Tx one, the input impedance of the last one drastically decreases, which results in efficient power transfer. This impedance is initially so high that the Tx antenna in the absence of the Rx one does not accept power, which implies negligible open-circuit losses. This feature grants the automatic activation/deactivation of the WT system. In the present work, we suggest the qualitative modification of the HIC-based WPT system aiming its operation at two very different frequencies. The upper frequency is above 500 MHz which was earlier considered technically not achievable for HICs.

First, a novel ±45° wide-beam dual-polarized planar antenna element is proposed, which is constructed by loading one stacked patch and four patch-via-wall structures on a conventional patch antenna. Among them, the stacked patch is used for the realization of the wideband feature and the patch-via-wall loadings are beneficial for the wide-beam feature by generating vertical electrical fields. Second, the mechanism of the wide-beam feature is investigated by analyzing the electric field distributions of the patch antenna on E- and H-planes, respectively. By optimizing the patch-via-wall loadings, synthetic electric fields with wide-beam features on both horizontal and vertical directions can be realized. Accordingly, the beamwidth of the proposed ±45° dual-polarized antenna element can be enlarged from 98° to 128°. Further, the proposed wide-beam antenna element is applied to construct a  $4\times4$  array integrated in an LTCC package within a small distance of about  $0.45\lambda _{0}$ . Moreover, several decoupling loops are loaded between adjacent elements to introduce an extra path that can reduce the couplings below −21 dB. As a result, the array can achieve a good beam-scanning capability over a wideband of 19.7% with a maximum scanning angle up to ±58° and a small gain variation less than 2.8 dB. Meanwhile, over the entire bandwidth, the scanning angles are up to ±55°. In addition, the active S-parameters almost always remain below −10 dB, enabling good impedance matching when scanning at large angles.

In this study, a complete wireless power transfer (WPT) system and data transmission for remote patient health monitoring is proposed, comprising an implantable receiver (Rx) antenna, an efficient rectifier integrated with the Rx, and a transmitter (Tx) antenna. The implantable Rx antenna has small footprints with dimensions  $\pi \times 5^{2}\,\,\times0.75$  (58.9 mm3) and exhibits dual-band characteristics: 915 and 2450 MHz for simultaneous wireless power reception and data transmission, respectively. The rectifier of a similar size to the antenna was optimized to operate at 915 MHz with an RF–dc conversion efficiency of 82%. The individual components of the WPT system were simulated, optimized, fabricated, and measured for scattering parameters and gain in a saline-filled 3-D head phantom and minced pork. The implantable antenna and rectifier were then integrated to form a compact rectenna system. A demonstration is performed in the realistic scenario to determine the power reception capability of the proposed implantable rectenna system. For safety purposes, specific absorption rate (SAR) and temperature analysis were conducted and found to be within acceptable limits. Finally, to verify the reliability of the communication link with an external unit, the received power was measured, and the implantable Rx element was found to be capable of effectively communicating over distances of up to 2 m.

The CSI-based method sets the data in the sample set as interpolation points to construct interpolation functions, while the GRNN-based method uses the input–output pairs in the sample dataset to train the model offline, learning the laws of the problem. Then, the desired amplitude excitations can be potentially obtained in a real-time way, either by the well-constructed interpolation function or the well-trained GRNN model. Finally, the representative numerical validations of a 514-element conformal array are presented to assess the effectiveness of the proposed two methods.

Typically, the thickness or structural complexity of the transmission-type PB metasurfaces may limit their efficiency. Here, we propose a single-substrate, ultrathin, transmission-type PB phase metasurface with a transmission coefficient of approximately unity for CP waves. To achieve this, the Huygens principle is applied in the design. The proposed metasurface is capable of achieving high-efficiency transmission amplitude of two orthogonal linear polarizations in the working frequency band, as well as the 180° phase difference. Thus, high-efficiency CP transmission with nearly unity can be obtained, and 360° of phase modulation can be covered by rotating the element. Meanwhile, the proposed metasurface is a single-substrate structure and its thickness is only  $0.06\lambda _{0}$ , offering a simple yet efficient method for antenna design. As a proof of concept, a metalens antenna and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) wave generator based on the proposed metasurface are experimentally demonstrated. The measured results show good agreements with the full-wave simulations, successfully verifying the design theory.

The least squares error (LSE) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) are often used as typical full-space numerical compensation methods for deformed arrays. LSE can be applied to arbitrary arrays with different deformations. Unfortunately, the LSE approach necessitates complex calculations. FFT can be used for fast compensation of structural deformation for uniform arrays with a slight loss of compensation accuracy compared with LSE, but it is not suitable for conformal arrays with nonuniform distribution and different elements’ orientations. In this study, a modified FFT combined with the LSE method (MFFT-LSE) was proposed to achieve fast compensation for deformed conformal arrays with a small loss of accuracy. First, a compensation model for deformed conformal arrays considering the MC effect was developed using LSE. The conformal array radiation pattern was approximated as the radiation pattern of a virtual uniform array with different element orientations.

The asymmetrical half-wavelength dipole operates at low frequency (LF) (0.92 GHz) with right-hand CP (RHCP) radiation. For the left-hand CP (LHCP) radiation at high frequency (HF) (2.45 GHz), the asymmetrical quarter-wavelength monopole works with fundamental mode and the higher order mode plays a major role in three-quarter wavelength monopole. An optimized  $2\times2$  array is designed to further extend the 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth and enhance the realized gain by using a simple 1-to-4 sequential-phase feeding network. An artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) with  $9\times9$  unit cells is adopted to reduce the profile height of the antenna array. A prototype of the final optimized antenna array is fabricated and measured to validate this new approach.

The dipole design is characterized by its open distal end, which allows for a lack of restriction on the movement of the tongue, and also offers an increased depth of sensitivity that allows for dental roots. The finite element method (FEM) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations were used to optimize the antenna performance and identify the optimum gaps in the shield that ensure a uniform current distribution at the desired frequency band. Finally, a fabricated prototype was evaluated in minced pork to measure the reflection coefficient in open- and closed-mouth scenarios. The optimal configurations were determined with gaps on both sides of the fully flexible dipole antenna at small and large curvatures. Furthermore, the implementation of the dipole antenna has led to improvement in the  $\text{B}_{1}^{+}$  field homogeneity, resulting in higher transmit and specific absorption rate (SAR) efficiency.

In order to simultaneously achieve convenient beam scanning, low sideband level (SBL), and low-sidelobe level (SLL), a general amplitude weighting method based on stepped time-modulated waveforms with different amplitudes in STMPA is proposed in this article. By selecting an appropriate number of steps, time-modulated waveforms can achieve various amplitude weighting values with a large dynamic range. This enables continuous and precise control of the amplitude weighting for each element. By utilizing this method, it is convenient to design time-modulated waveforms for each antenna element independently to suppress undesired sidebands, which avoids repeated time-consuming optimization during beam scanning. To verify the proposed method, an eight-element low-sidelobe STMPA was fabricated and tested, with a measured SLL of −3.53 dB and a measured SBL of −33.34 dB.

The polarization-rotation PMSs (PRPMSs) receive plane waves from different angles and reradiate polarization-rotated plane waves to a wanted direction. The impedance transforming characteristic of the patch under different incident angles between spatial wave to guided wave is studied with an equivalent circuit model (ECM). All the parameters in the ECM are obtained through one full-wave simulation with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) under normal incidence in CST. The polarization rotation ability is realized by converting TM10 mode to TM01 mode on the patch through a microstrip line. The polarization conversion ratio (PCR) of the PMS with different incidences, scan angles, and polarizations is modeled by the ECM. Then, PRPMS elements with different microstrip line lengths are studied for phase tuning. The relationship between the microstrip line length and the phase shift is calculated via ECM and verified via full-wave simulation, both of which show that a continuous phase shifting range of 360° can be easily provided. In this way, the scattered waves can be steered in an arbitrarily prescribed direction. To validate the design concept under different incident angles, three PRPMS prototypes with the main beam steered to 0°, 30°, and 50° are fabricated and tested. Measured normalized RCS results agree well with the calculated and simulated ones, which verifies the validity of the proposed ECM and the PRPMS.

Specifically, by use of the polarization converting radiator, the quasi-TEM mode in the parallel plate waveguide (PPW) can easily excite the CP radiation without the mode transition. This leads to a lower profile. With the inherent 90° phase difference between the orthogonal polarization components of the radiator, the wide CP bandwidth is realized. By use of the comb-like structure, the mutual couplings along two directions are simultaneously suppressed to realize the large beam scanning range in 2-D. In addition, the width taper and the accurate phase sampling by the input waveguides, which connects the PPW and the radiators, also enhance the operation bandwidth and the beam scanning range, respectively. As a result, the operation band can be from 27.5 to 31.0 GHz. The beam scanning range can be up to ±60°. The axial ratios (ARs) are below 3 dB within the bandwidth and the beam scanning range.

Hence, the TA unit can achieve gain filtering and wavefront manipulation simultaneously. To verify the performance of the proposed design, a multibeam TA prototype is designed and fabricated at a center frequency of 26.0 GHz. The size of the TA is  $156.0\times 156.0\times116.5$  mm3 ( $13.5\,\,\lambda \times 13.5\,\,\lambda \times 10.1\,\,\lambda$ ). The measured results show that the TA can achieve five beams with the 2-D beam-scanning range of ±28°.

In channels without line-of-sight, first- and second-order reflections contribute about 60% of the total power. Large interior and exterior walls of buildings are found most influential to the multipath channel.

Using Fourier optics (FOs) and the Tikhonov method, the original wavefront distribution fields are reconstructed on the surface of real-life automotive radomes. During the phase deviation reconstruction, wrapped phase errors significantly degrade the quality of the reconstructed field. To mitigate the effect of wrapped phase errors, the phase correlation matching (PCM) process is proposed. The simulation results of the diagnostic methodology demonstrate that the PCM process effectively identifies dielectric defect regions on curved surfaces. In addition, both simulation and experimental diagnostics scenarios are conducted to validate the proposed methodology. The scenarios are structured based on various parameters, such as dielectric size, source directivity, and the radius of curvature for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous radome covers. As a result, the proposed diagnostic methodology achieves an accuracy of over 90% in localized defects such as dielectric patches and protrusions on the radome surface. Finally, the proposed method exhibits higher computational efficiency compared with previously reported diagnostic methods; furthermore, the proposed algorithm presents a potential solution for quality control procedures on automotive assembly lines and real-life radome applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3320261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10272299","Automotive application;inverse source problems;nondestructive testing;radome;source reconstruction method (SRM);Tikhonov regularization","Radomes;Surface reconstruction;Optical surface waves;Dielectrics;Surface treatment;Phase change materials;Mathematical models","","1","","38","IEEE","4 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While deterministic or stochastic methods have been widely utilized to construct arrays in free space, challenges arise when dealing with the scenario of TWRI since the electromagnetic (EM) wave interacts complexly with wall materials. Moreover, many TWRI scenarios involve multilayered walls, a factor often overlooked in previous array designs. This work presents a wall-parameters dependent sparse multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array design approach for TWRI. First, the signal model for radar imaging through layered walls is presented, incorporating the transmission coefficients to represent wave propagation within the wall layers. Second, the averaged sidelobe level and the entropy of the Gram matrix are chosen as optimization criteria. The latter metric assesses the severity of sidelobe distribution in nontarget regions for a given array.

Accurate prediction of the maximum usable frequency (MUF) is critical to improve the efficiency of HF ionospheric propagation. Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in time-series prediction in recent years. However, the MUF is a nonstationary time series with complex properties of multiple time scales. Therefore, we must fully explore the features of the MUF sequence to provide reliable support for selecting deep-learning prediction models. In this article, we first decompose the real-world MUF-measured data from vertical sounding stations to obtain different components. After analyzing the phenomena of each component at different positions, we propose the capability requirements of the MUF prediction model and verify the capability requirements by comparing the existing most advanced deep-learning prediction models. Then, we calculate the complexity of the MUF sequence based on multiscale entropy. Through the entropy series at different time scales, the key to improving the model’s prediction performance is the fitting ability of the nonlinear change of the long-term trend component in the short-period scale. Furthermore, we propose a quantitative prediction scheme of MUF based on multiscale entropy similarity tolerance. Based on the Fano inequality, we calculate and compare the upper and lower bounds of the predictability on the quantization sequence and the original data and verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Through experimental results, as the latitude decreases, the models based on time-series decomposition have better prediction performance over the state-of-the-art schemes. Compared to nontime-series decomposition deep-learning models, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the predicted MUF values for four cities, ranging from low to high latitude, decreased by an average of 0.11, 0.20, 0.02, and 0.03 MHz, respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3329354","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U20B2038,62171462,62231027,61931011,62101594); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10311528","Deep learning;high-frequency communication;ionospheric vertical sounding;maximum usable frequency (MUF);predictability;time-series decomposition","Predictive models;Deep learning;Time series analysis;Entropy;Data models;Market research;Loss measurement","","8","","69","IEEE","7 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, the signal pathway between these components is achieved by the antenna’s internal electromagnetic coupling rather than a conductive connection, leading to lower radiation loss and larger availability in design space. This communication, moreover, presents several representative schemes of the DIA architecture and compares them with conventional architectures. In particular, a new scheme using the same basic structure is proposed to further reduce manufacturing costs and simplify the production cycle. To demonstrate this new scheme, three antenna examples using the same dipole on the package are designed. By combining different auxiliary structures on PCB/shell, varying radiation patterns, including beam steering, gain enhancement, and polarization conversion, are achieved. The simulated and measured results both show that all antennas can reach a wide impedance bandwidth of 24.25–29.5 GHz, with a high radiation efficiency exceeding 70%; therefore, the feasibility of the new scheme for DIA architecture is sufficiently verified.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3324452","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFA0717500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271212); Guangdong Basic Applied Basic Research Foundation Grant Outstanding Youth Fund Project(grant numbers:2021B1515020039); Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program(grant numbers:2017ZT07X032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10288336","Antenna in package (AiP);distributed integrated antenna (DIA);mobile terminals;multiple radiation patterns;the auxiliary structures;the same basic structure","Dipole antennas;Antennas;Mobile antennas;Substrates;Millimeter wave communication;Aperture antennas;Antenna measurements","","1","","25","IEEE","19 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the commonly used surface impedance modulation (SIM) method usually has the disadvantage of low leaky wave efficiency. In this communication, we apply the field-distribution modulation (FDM) method to help improve the radiation efficiency of the leaky wave antennas (LWAs) by periodically designing the discontinuity of electric-field distributions between two deep subwavelength periodic transmission lines (TLs). Specifically, we guide a pair of surface EM waves with electric fields concentrated on each side of the midline using two segments of single-conductor comb lines (SCCLs) with opposite grooving directions and achieve the effective leaky wave radiations by their interleaved arrangements to form a periodic field-distribution mismatch. Simulation and measurement results show that the FDM-assisted SIM SCCL LWAs can break through the modulated limitation of pure SIM and have a better performance in terms of radiation efficiency. Finally, we solve the low-efficiency problem that usually occurs in amplitude-weighted low sidelobe LWAs using the FDM method, and achieve the SCCL LWA with high efficiency and low sidelobe characteristics. These results indicate that the FDM method is expected to achieve more efficient leaky wave radiations of highly bounded surface EM waves.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3329957","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700201); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071117,61831006,62288101); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:111-2-05); Project for Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professor; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20230192); Fundamental Research Funds of the Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Articially-Structured Functional Materials and Devices(grant numbers:AFMD-KFJJ-22202); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242023K5002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10314453","High-efficiency radiation;leaky wave antenna (LWA);single-conductor comb lines (SCCLs)","Surface impedance;Modulation;Surface waves;Frequency division multiplexing;Impedance;Electric fields;Harmonic analysis","","4","","29","IEEE","9 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is possible by the vertical placement of copper-cladded FR-4 substrate with air gaps between two halves and maintains the boundary condition to support the dominant  $\mathrm {\textbf {HEM}}_{\textbf {11}\boldsymbol {\delta }}$  mode of CDRA.

Relevant examples are provided, as well as a rigorous approach to model the effect that second-order symmetries along with the geometry of the rotational unit cell have on the mode-class monomode bandwidth. Modal spectrum shaping and rotational transversal dispersion diagrams are checked with asymptotic cases and results for regular polygons. Finally, a general workflow for the design of the rotational unit cell is provided.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3323759","Spanish Government(grant numbers:PID2020-116968RB-C32 (DEWICOM),TED2021-130650BC21 (ANT4CLIM)); MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 (Agencia Estatal de Investigación); (EuropeanUnion) “NextGenerationEU”/PRTR; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10287113","Higher-order symmetries;transverse electric (TE) modes;transverse magnetic (TM) modes;waveguides","Bandwidth;Electromagnetic waveguides;Geometry;Planar waveguides;Dispersion;Cutoff frequency;Circular waveguides","","1","","16","IEEE","17 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The working principle is inspired by the concepts of folded reflectarray antenna (FRA) and Alvarez lens. The proposed antenna works at 15 GHz and consists of two parts. One part is a passive metasurface (MS), and the other part is an integrated part of array antenna, feed network, and another MS. By adjusting the relative position between the two parts, a variable focal length from 86 to 220 mm can be achieved. The design process is analyzed in detail and verified by simulation and experiment. The method proposed in this communication has the advantages of simple design and low cost, offering new possibilities for further NFF antenna systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3323092","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62071291); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10286370","Alvarez lens;folded reflectarray antenna (FRA);metasurface (MS);near-field-focused (NFF) antenna;variable focal point","Reflector antennas;Lenses;Antenna arrays;Metasurfaces;Metals;Antennas;Antenna feeds","","14","","30","IEEE","16 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
