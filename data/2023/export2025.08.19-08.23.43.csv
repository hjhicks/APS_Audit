Two compensation methodologies, wavefront phase advance and wavefront phase lag, are given and analyzed in detail. By combining the two compensation methods, the wavefronts of adjacent elements with opposite phases can be transformed into those with the same phase, achieving a broadside beam. In addition, the relationship between the directivity and radiation quality factor of the radiation structure is discussed in detail, which is used to solve the problem of different gains of the radiation elements in the array. For verification, a first-order filtering antenna array with five elements and a fifth-order filtering antenna array with ten elements are designed using the TE501 mode cavity. The fifth-order filtering antenna array is fabricated and measured. The measured gain in the passband is stable and the maximum gain is 17.3 dBi.

The usual OAM generation methods based on phase-shifted circular ring arrays require a complex feed network. In this article, a ring array with low-order OAM single antennas as the array elements of in-phase feed is proposed to simplify the array structure and increase the practicality. The theoretical analysis shows that the phase singularity of the radiation fields appears in the array boresight direction. The region just close to the array axis radiates only the first-order OAM mode, independent of the antenna element OAM order. Outer these regions, however,  $1-N$  order vortex waves determined only by the array element number  $N$  can be realized. The hexagonal array of the fifth-order OAM has experimentally confirmed these conclusions. Clearly, for this kind of array, higher order OAM modes are easily achieved, and the order can be controlled by regulating the number of array elements. Since it is fed in phase, this construction method for OAM antenna array is very practical.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3278842","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62071403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196414","Annular ring array;electromagnetic vortex wave;higher order orbital angular momentum (OAM);in-phase feeding","Antenna arrays;Phased arrays;Spirals;Directive antennas;Azimuth;Antenna feeds;Structural rings","","13","","37","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite this interest, little work in either the RF or in higher frequency regimes has been devoted to investigating full radiation solutions for a generalized elliptical loop with an arbitrary current distribution due to the additional complexity required to solve the perturbed (from the conventional circular case) radiation integrals. In this work, we present the full mathematically exact solution for an elliptical loop’s radiated power, directivity, and other far-field quantities assuming the current is represented as a Fourier cosine series. Further, we demonstrate that these solutions are accurate and in agreement with full-wave solutions for ellipses with axial ratios of five and show the convergence and accuracy of the provided analytical solutions up to extreme axial ratios of ten. Most importantly, these mathematically exact solutions provide a fundamental step toward a complete theoretical description for the radiation properties of elliptical loops, thereby enabling rapid analysis and optimization in comparison with computationally expensive full-wave solution methods. This is especially true for dispersive nanoloops, which typically require many thousands of mesh elements to accurately model.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3290087","Pennsylvania State University, College of Engineering McCain Chair Professorship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10171172","Arbitrary current;directivity;elliptical;exact expressions;loop antennas;radiation resistance;total radiated power","Loop antennas;Current distribution;Resistance;Geometry;Radio frequency;Optimization;Mathematical models","","4","","23","IEEE","30 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic idea is to employ the feeding source operating in high-order TM20 (TM02) mode to generate split beams. Then, by loading an F–P cavity and a phase-gradient MS, the narrow main lobe is obtained. Also, the gain is raised and the sidelobe level (SLL) is cut down. In addition, for the single-source antenna, the impedance matching is improved and the gain is further enhanced by loading holes. Moreover, through adding a parasitic unit, the SLL is dropped. For the multisource antenna, by etching slots, the isolation between four ports is improved and the SLL is further reduced. Finally, both the simulated and measured results verify the proposed method. The realized single-source multibeam antenna operates in the range of 9.74–10.62 GHz and has a lower SLL of 21.28 dB. Four beams point to ( $\theta $ ,  $\phi$ ) = (57°, 0°), (57°, 90°), (57°, 180°), and (57°, 270°). For the multisource case, the antenna has a gain of 11.26 dBi, the isolation better than 20.52 dB, and the SLL of 12.16 dB.

However, the time-varying and periodic nature of the FDA beam pattern prevents the achievement of a time-invariant range–angle-focused beam pattern. Consequently, a range–angle-focused beam is only achieved at a specific time instant. Therefore, it is not yet possible to focus a beam on a specific point or area in space permanently in a time-invariant manner, due to both natural propagation mechanisms and the independent time parameter. Once a wave is transmitted, time variation cannot be altered. Thus, for the FDA beam pattern, it continues to propagate over time indefinitely. However, in the case of receiving, the time parameter is under the control of the receiver. The receiver can set the time at which the incoming wave is sampled or acquired. In this study, a cross-linear array structure called the sequential multicarrier receive FDA (SMCR-FDA) and a relevant methodology are proposed to obtain a three-dimensionally localized time-invariant range–angle-focused receive beam pattern. Additionally, several novel concepts, including the cross-linear array structure, the secure reception concept, and the positional modulation (PoM) technique, are introduced.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3286025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155561","3-D beam steering;antenna arrays;beam localization;dot-shaped beam;frequency diverse array (FDA) receiver;frequency diversity;positional modulation (PoM);time-invariant beam","Receivers;Transmitters;Periodic structures;Focusing;Couplings;Phased arrays;Linear antenna arrays","","4","","34","IEEE","19 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The complex permittivity extraction of 3-D-printed filaments for an associated printing pattern is required for accurate design and modeling of antennas, as the commercially available filaments lack RF properties information. Accurate extractions of various 3-D-printed filaments are presented using curve fitting of simulated to measured scattering parameters of custom-designed test circuits. Extracted complex permittivity of implemented circuits depends on various 3-D-printer settings, infill percentage, and 3-D-printing patterns for different materials. The extraction was performed over broadband (1–10 GHz) using a microstrip transmission line (TL) and narrowband using an annular ring resonator (ARR) (2.4 and 5.4 GHz) enclosed in a metallic cavity package for popular polylactide (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) filaments. A statistical analysis of three test circuits of each category is performed to have an accurate extraction process. According to our extraction, the ABS filament had a lower loss tangent than PLA. The complex permittivity of ABS filaments with a triangular pattern and a 10% infill had an average value of 1.36-j0.006 and 1.34-j0.012, whereas with 100% infill, it was an average of 2.5-j0.012 and 2.52-j0.016 at 2.4 and 5.4 GHz, respectively. The 3-D-printed probe-fed annular ring antennas (ARAs) of three different infills were designed, simulated, manufactured, and evaluated against baseline performance using RT/Duroid for Wi-Fi bands of 2.4 and 5.4 GHz.

The CMA reveals that there are mainly two modes, namely, the half-wavelength mode of the ground and the quarter-wavelength mode of the branch, for the TWS earphone antenna. The two modes are mainly controlled by the ground and the branch, respectively. And for the compact earphone with a short ear bar, only the half-wavelength mode contributes to the radiation at the 2.45-GHz band which is mainly controlled by the integrated inductor on the ground. The measured results of the compact TWS earphone antenna prototypes illustrate that, the integrated inductor improves the −6-dB impedance bandwidth from 136 MHz (2364–2500 MHz) to 160 MHz (2360–2520 MHz) on the head.

Slots are etched on the sidewalls near the input of the open-ended square waveguide, which couple part of the energy to the periodic structures loaded on the sidewalls and excite the TM0 modes. The surface wave is excited on the periodic structures. The periodic structures are equivalent to a dielectric rod with a graded dielectric constant. Part of the energy coupled to the periodic structures is radiated during the transmission, which combines with the energy radiated by the open waveguide, forming a plane wave to produce a high-gain endfire beam in the far-field. The antenna is printed using stereo lithography appearance (SLA) 3-D printing technology, and then a layer of copper is plated on the outer surface to make the antenna equivalent to an all-metal structure. Compared with the dielectric-loaded open-ended waveguide antennas, 3-D-printed all-metal periodic structures reduce dielectric loss and processing costs. The antenna structure is a square waveguide, so an orthogonal-mode transducer (OMT) and circular polarizer can be used to achieve dual linear polarization (LP) and dual circular polarization (CP). The simulated results show that the proposed antenna achieves a gain enhancement of about up to 8 dB (compared with an unloaded open waveguide antenna).

By investigating a simple antenna array, it is shown that the proposed parameter provides additional insights into the behavior of an antenna system when compared to established methods. Moreover, since the uncertainty parameter is calculated from a set of far fields, it is applicable to port far fields as well as Characteristic Modes (CMs). This finding is utilized to derive design guidance: starting with a set of CM far fields, the angular distribution of the uncertainty is investigated to verify that no ambiguities are present. Different sets of far fields are compared, and the differences regarding their DF behavior are visualized and explained using the uncertainty in conjunction with an estimate of the incident field. To quantify these differences, a key performance indicator (KPI) is introduced that summarizes the DF capabilities over a selected angular region. To demonstrate the design process, a multimode multiport antenna (M3PA) with three uncorrelated ports is developed, manufactured, and measured.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3291424","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action within the Luftfahrtforschungsprogramm (LuFo) through Project Master360(grant numbers:20D1905C); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10177879","Characteristic modes (CMs);direction finding (DF) antennas;direction of arrival (DoA);multiport antennas","Antennas;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Directive antennas;Antenna measurements;Uncertainty;Antenna arrays;Freeports","","12","","38","IEEE","10 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

F2M progressively defines the templates as intermediate solutions between the starting point and the specifications considering the radiated field behavior in each intermediate stage. The advantages of F2M are demonstrated with two examples, which synthesizes the amplitude of the near field in a challenging scenario, setting constraints in a transverse and offset plane to the metalens aperture. One of the syntheses aims to reach a uniform field distribution through a curved corridor in a range of 14 m to provide coverage at 39 GHz. The synthesized phase shift distribution is used to design and manufacture a prototype to evaluate its performance. The measurements agree with both synthesis and full-wave results.

Two new techniques, which are based on higher-order probe correction, are presented. These enable the full characterization of up to three higher-order antennas. The first technique, where only two of the antennas need to occupy the probe position, is useful for the accurate characterization of at least the antenna that is not employed as a probe.

This article analyzes electromagnetic interactions between a circularly polarized (CP) antenna and TPS through multilayer Green’s function and reciprocity theorem. Two orthogonally placed Hertzian diploes represent an equivalent CP antenna. Radiation pattern and axial ratio (AR) are rigorously calculated. With TPS, the AR beamwidth is compromised and the main lobe splits. An impedance ground (IG) is proposed to replace metallic ground for alleviating the negative effects of TPS. An Archimedean spiral antenna is fabricated and measured for verification. The AR beamwidth is widened by 32° on average in the frequency range of 3–8 GHz. Additionally, the split of the main lobe existing in the frequency range of 4.6–5.4 GHz is repaired and the realized gain in the broadside is improved by ~1.8 dBi. As a price, the radiation efficiency of the spiral antenna is reduced by ~14% since partial radiation is absorbed by IG. High-temperature (HT) heating experiment reaching up to 800 °C is conducted to verify the thermal protection performance.

This article presents a novel multiband 2.5-D FSS with dual operations in the transmission and reflection modes. The FSS exhibits dual-band bandstop filtering in transmission mode to shield EMI at sub-6-GHz 5G, WLAN and WiMAX frequencies. In the proposed multilayer geometry, two stopband (SB) resonances (at 2.32 and 4.04 GHz) are generated using enhanced capacitance loaded modified Jerusalem cross (EC-MJC) and via connected meandered square loop (VC-MSL). FSS transmits the signal with a low insertion loss of <0.6 dB at passband frequency (2.98 GHz) existing between two reflection bands. The miniaturized unit cell size ( $ < 0.07~\lambda \text{L}$ ), polarization insensitive, and highly stable filter response at almost all incidence angles (up to 80°) are the attractive features of the designed FSS. In reflection mode, the 2.5-D FSS has been configured for multiband microwave absorbers at dual, triple, and quad-band resonances.

Multiple PCMs with coding phases are employed for wideband RCS reduction, and the spatial locations of the PCMs are utilized for bistatic RCS reduction since it arouses a spatial phase. Furthermore, it is derived that the Pancharatnam–Berry (P-B) phase provides extra design freedom for bistatic RCS reduction. These three types of phases are combined for optimal wideband bistatic RCS reduction. To facilitate bistatic RCS reduction design, the variance of the scattered field ( $\bar \delta _{E}$ ) is derived as an indicator for the evenness of the whole space electric field distribution, and an optimal design method is developed thereafter. For comparison, two RCS reduction surfaces, termed MS1 and MS2, respectively, composed of phase coding PCMs are designed, fabricated, and measured to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The MS1 is designed by only using the spatial phase, and multiple coding phases, while MS2 is designed by further exploiting the P-B phase. The MS2 achieves 10-dB monostatic RCS reduction ranging from 8.8 to 25.4 GHz (97.1% relative bandwidth, which is 2.2% better than that of the MS1). More importantly, the MS2 realizes super diffuse characteristics under different incidences. It achieves 10-dB bistatic RCS reduction ranging from 9 to 25 GHz (94.2% relative bandwidth), and the maximum bistatic RCS reduction can reach up to 20 dB.

The low computational complexity and the effectiveness of the proposed method are achieved by combining three calculation strategies: 1) evaluating the coupling effects between two close units using a rigorous fast PWE technique and ignoring those of well-separated units; 2) determining the threshold defining “well-separated” through an adaptive procedure so that the overall accuracy is controllable; and 3) quickly estimating the initial solution (IS) to accelerate convergence. Extensive numerical simulations, including one with up to 56 electrically large UAVs, are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3292483","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62271046,62231003); Young Elite Scientist Scholarship Program by China Association for Science and Technology (CAST)(grant numbers:2020QNRC001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10179259","Method of moment;multiple targets’ scattering;plane wave expansion (PWE);radar cross section;swarm targets","Couplings;Surface waves;Mathematical models;Drones;Green's function methods;Data structures;Surface treatment","","5","","31","IEEE","11 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When they are applied as very thin heterogeneous layers on the surface of the target, the simulation by a full-wave method based on a meshed model has to deal with a multiscale problem, resulting in a huge amount of unknowns. This article proposes to apply the metamaterial as an equivalent boundary condition via the Leontovich formula. The frequency-angle-polarization-dependent model is integrated on the surface target with a conformal FDTD resolution method. To establish the surface impedance model, a pattern of the metamaterial is modeled with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). The spectral finite-difference time-domain (SFDTD) scheme is retained, because the existing numerical models developed for the FDTD method can be easily adapted to this method. Then, the Courant Friedrichs Lewy (CFL) condition of the spectral FDTD method is not restrictive and is the one given by the standard Yee scheme. The accuracy of the new scheme is first compared with the full material FDTD meshing and the Cartesian surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC) model when the target is a plate or a cube. Finally, the computational efficiency of the proposed SIBC model is evaluated on a cylinder with comparisons among FEKO, CST software, and our homemade solver.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3297330","Direction générale de l’armement, l’Agence de l’innovation de Défense; Centre d’études Scientifiques et Techniques d’Aquitaine, Commissariat l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10194539","Angle-dependent surface impedance boundary condition (AD-SIBC);conformal FDTD;metamaterial","Metamaterials;Finite difference methods;Surface impedance;Time-domain analysis;Magnetic materials;Impedance;Computational modeling","","2","","24","IEEE","25 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the difficulty is shifted to the notoriously difficult resolution of the phase retrieval (PR) problem, the instability of which is commonly mitigated by the acquisition of a large number of phaseless field samples.

The polarization relations of these media are fractional integro-differential equations and their FDTD modeling exhibits significant difficulties. However, a common property of these media is the fact that their time-domain susceptibility functions are completely monotone. By exploiting this significant property, the approximation of the susceptibility by means of sums of decaying exponentials is proposed. In particular, the approximants are derived by Prony’s method. In contrast to previously reported studies, which also adopt Prony’s method, the required consistency of the derived exponential terms is considered. Actually, it is shown that the parameters of the Prony approximants should fulfill specific restrictions, which are equivalent to approximating the media by sums of Debye terms only. The proposed FDTD scheme is based on discretizing the convolutional polarization relation by use of recurrence formulas, while the singularity of the original susceptibilities at the time origin is appropriately circumvented. Comparisons between analytical and FDTD results for the reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the transfer functions inside the dispersive media illustrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme, over a wideband frequency range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3291075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10176309","Cole–Cole (CC) model;completely monotone (CM) functions;Davidson–Cole (DC) model;dispersive media;finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods;Havriliak–Negami (HN) model;Prony’s method;Raicu model","Time-domain analysis;Finite difference methods;Media;Dispersion;Mathematical models;Dielectrics;Permittivity","","2","","32","IEEE","7 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using a cycle-generative adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) machine-learning network, we show that we can calibrate data from a 2-D scalar microwave imaging (MWI) system and successfully reconstruct targets. Cycle-GAN makes use of two sets of data: experimental and synthetic. Unlike traditional calibration, there is no need for the experimental data to be labeled, i.e., the calibration targets do not need to be “known.” The results show that with an experimental calibration set of roughly 150 targets, the Cycle-GAN approach provides comparable results to known-target calibration for the class of targets we used in this 2-D near-field MWI system.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3296915","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Research Chair Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10192554","Calibration;cycle-generative adversarial networks (Cycle-GANs);electromagnetic imaging;microwave imaging (MWI)","Calibration;Generators;Microwave imaging;Generative adversarial networks;Training;Computational modeling;Microwave theory and techniques","","16","","40","IEEE","24 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is, however, shown that coupling the external electromagnetic field to these circuits can nullify their performance. On the other hand, it is observed that at the moderate level of operating current, the superconducting microstrip transmission lines (SMTLs) show nonlinear behavior. This article focuses on external field coupling to SMTL in nonlinear operation, which has not been considered by the researchers. To tackle this issue, first, an equivalent model is proposed in which the superconducting film is replaced by a nonlinear impedance sheet. The boundary condition is then applied to the equivalent nonlinear impedance sheet. The mixed potential integral equation (MPIE) technique is employed through which a nonlinear integral equation is established. The analysis is performed under different settings of the amplitude of incidence wave and temperature. The results show that at amplitude above 1 kV/m, the induced current contains higher order wavenumber due to the nonlinear behavior of the superconductor. Further, our studies reveal that by decreasing the temperature, the SMTL exhibits less nonlinearity.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3295003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10186343","Nonlinear integral equation;nonlinearity;superconducting","Impedance;Superconducting films;Superconducting transmission lines;Couplings;Superconducting microwave devices;Superconducting integrated circuits;Mathematical models","","1","","26","IEEE","18 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on these issues, clarifying radio propagation characteristics and modeling techniques is important for the system and area design of beyond 5G/6G, which will utilize various frequencies in any environment. We have developed a site-specific path loss model by extracting features of the propagation environment by machine learning using images of three regions as input data: the transmitting point, the receiving point, and the region between both points. However, image scaling is required in the region between the points to keep the image size constant in accordance with the distance. Therefore, even if the propagation path is the same, the effect on the propagation characteristics caused by shadowing is different. In this article, we propose a method to parameterize the environment on the propagation path in the region between the transmitting and receiving points with a constant size regardless of distance and combine it with images around the points. Since the dominant path that contributes to path loss characteristics depends on the urban structure between transmitting and receiving points, parameterizing the environment on the propagation path should improve the estimation accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through an evaluation using 800-MHz and 2-GHz measured data in urban, suburban, and rural areas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3295890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10189382","Beyond 5G mobile communication;convolution neural networks (NNs);deep neural network (DNN);machine learning;path loss prediction;path profile;principal component analysis","Predictive models;Propagation losses;Data models;Buildings;Radio propagation;Mathematical models;Feature extraction","","11","","32","IEEE","20 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The AIPAA’s unit-cell comprises three K-band miniaturized tapered slot elements, a GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) as a power amplifier (PA), a stability circuit, an input matching network (M.N.), and biasing components. The tapered slot antenna element is reshaped so that its input impedance closely matches the optimal load impedance of the HEMT ( $\text{Z}_{opt}$  = 6 +  $\text{j}38 {\Omega }$  at 22 GHz), which enhances the system efficiency. The peak-integrated PAs’ power-added efficiency (PAE ${_{p}}$ ) is  $\geq 56$ % with  $\leq 9$ % variation over scan coverage (g±50°) at 1.5 dB power backoff from P1dB. The peak AIPAA system power-added efficiency (PAE ${_{s}}$ ) is 51% with a peak array radiation efficiency of 92%. The relative frequency bandwidth with PAE ${_{p}}$  above 25% is between 9% and 13% over the scan range. The proposed AIPAA demonstrates less than 0.9 and 1 dB scanloss over the scan coverage in terms of antenna array gain and PAs’ power gain (Gp), respectively.

For these applications, it is essential to ensure a high beam crossover gain to provide a robust service to end users within the steering range. Here, we propose a geodesic generalized Luneburg lens antenna operating from 57 to 67 GHz that provides increased crossover gain compared to previously reported geodesic Luneburg lens antennas. The focal curve of the generalized Luneburg lens can be displaced from the beamformer, allowing for a higher angular resolution in the placement of the feed array along the focal curve. The lens is fed with 21 ridge waveguides with an angular separation of 5.1°, thus providing beam steering in a 102° range.

Instead of using the two polarizations separately as usual, it blends the orthogonal linearly-polarized radiations to achieve wider beamwidth. The proposed method is implemented on a typical ±45°-polarized base station antenna array with its thought process and working mechanism elaborated. Much wider beamwidth is achieved compared to the traditional pattern synthesis methods based on the amplitude and phase weighting or sparse arrays. The beamwidth can be controlled by simply tuning one phase shifter. Importantly, this method allows all the elements to be fully excited with the same amplitude, thus avoiding using additional amplifiers or attenuators. In the meantime, the polarization-mixing method leads to spatially-variable polarizations (SVP). To obtain polarization diversity required in cellular communication systems, two SVP arrays with the same pattern shapes are designed to have their polarizations orthogonal to each other in all directions of interest. The conditions of achieving orthogonal patterns using this method are theoretically derived and thoroughly validated in theory and in simulation. It is shown that the obtained spatially variable-orthogonal-polarization (SVOP) arrays have a much broader beam pattern and better polarization orthogonality (PO) than that of the dual-polarized antenna element.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3284015","Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA)(grant numbers:DE200101347); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154605","Base station antenna array;beamwidth control;cross-dipole;dual polarizations;polarization diversity;polarization orthogonality (PO);polarization-mixing;spatially-variable-orthogonal-polarization (SVOP);wide beamwidth","Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Dipole antennas;Base stations;Feeds;Phased arrays;Optimization","","5","","24","IEEE","16 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The HMS consists of periodic parallel metallic strips patterned on a thin dielectric substrate. Due to its strong anisotropy, the HMS exhibits a passband for electromagnetic (EM) waves propagating along the strip direction while a stopband for EM waves propagating along the orthogonal direction. When the HMS is placed close to the opening end of the Vivaldi antenna, the broadside radiation of the antenna can be suppressed while the endfire radiation is almost unaffected, leading to enhanced isolation between adjacent antennas. Rather than adding auxiliaries in between antennas, the HMS can be readily integrated into the antenna radiator structure, which is more favorable for practical applications, especially in compact spaces. To verify this method, the prototype was fabricated and measured. Both simulated and measured results show that when the distance is  $0.5\lambda _{0}$  ( $\lambda _{0}$  is the free-space wavelength of 10.0 GHz) between two Vivaldi antenna elements, the isolation can be increased by at least 10.0 dB in the whole X-band.

At 8.7 GHz, the electromagnetic wave under 30° TM oblique incidence is absorbed, and the wave under −30° TM oblique incidence transmits, which presents an angular-asymmetric transmission.

The presence of the ground plane allows us to isolate the response of the tag from surrounding objects making the proposed configuration suitable for nonplanar lossy objects like filled water bottles or containers. The periodic surface configuration is employed to obtain a sufficiently large RCS to increase the read range of the tags. The proposed tags operate between 26 and 40 GHz, which allows us to achieve the miniaturization necessary for practical scenarios. Toward low cost, thermal printing fabrication is investigated taking lithographic one as a reference. The associated severe loss (introduced by both ultrathin substrate and thermal printing) and the rotation sensitivity of depolarizing label are discussed theoretically and well addressed experimentally.

By adjusting the p-i-n diodes integrated on the feeding lines, the element presents four different phase states of −270°, −180°, −90°, and 0°, labeled as “00,” “01,” “10,” and “11.” An eight elements array antenna is designed based on the element. With the introduction of elaborately designed two groups of fixed phase delay, the sidelobe level (SLL) at different scanning angles can be effectively reduced in two polarized directions and the gain is also improved. The simulated and measured results of the fabricated prototype indicate that dual-polarized ±60° wide-angle beam scanning, moderate array gain, relatively low SLL, and low cross-polarization level can be achieved.

In each working cycle, the amplifying unit cell remains stable until it is triggered by the radiation wave from the oscillating unit cell for in-phase radiation, thereby amplifying the output power. In order to reduce the antenna spacing, the corners of the ground of the antennas are cut off and the threshold voltage of the amplifying unit cells is precisely controlled to offset the mutual coupling, consequently realizing a much compact system. The AIA systems with and without the amplifying unit cell are fabricated, and the measured results verify the power amplification characteristic of the compact and scalable system.

The metasurfaces considered are constructed from finite, patterned metallic claddings represented by homogenized impedance sheets supported by grounded dielectric spacers. Integral equations are used to model the response of the metasurface to a known excitation and solved by the method of moments. An accelerated gradient descent optimization algorithm is presented that enables the direct optimization of such metasurfaces. The gradient is normally calculated by solving the method of moments problem  $N+1$  times, where  $N$  is the number of homogenized elements in the metasurface. Since the calculation of each component of the  $N$ -dimensional gradient involves perturbing the moment method impedance matrix along one element of its diagonal and inverting the result, this numerical gradient calculation can be accelerated using the Woodbury matrix identity. The Woodbury matrix identity allows the inverse of the perturbed impedance matrix to be computed at a low cost by forming a rank-r correction to the inverse of the unperturbed impedance matrix. Timing diagrams show up to a 26.5 times improvement in algorithm times when the acceleration technique is applied.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3281667","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-18-1-2536); Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-19-1-0359); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10144554","Gradient descent;metasurface;method of moments;Woodbury matrix identity","Metasurfaces;Mathematical models;Impedance;Optimization;Integral equations;Finite element analysis;Method of moments","","14","","22","IEEE","5 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through the simulation of a reflector antenna whose efficiency is up to 51.4%, it can be found that the aperture distribution cannot be regarded as uniform distribution but as tapered distribution. Thus, expressions for near fields of uniform circular apertures cannot be applied to tapered circular aperture antennas in practical engineering. To alleviate such problems, near-field calculation formulas are proposed based on the Sommerfeld integrals with a steepest descent technique, which ensures the accurate and efficient analysis of the near field of the tapered circular aperture antenna. Also, near-field characteristics of tapered circular aperture antennas are displayed. The maximum difference of normalized near-field amplitudes between tapered and uniform distribution is 0.35 V/m. A 3-D near-field gain of circular aperture antennas is developed from the near-field radiation pattern. The proposed expression extends the range of calculation from the axial to more directions compared with the previous expression. Also, this expression is valid in both the near field and the far field. Using full-wave simulations, the results obtained from the proposed expression are compared with the simulated results. Also, the deviation in near-field gain is less than 0.3 dB, which indicates the convenience and effectiveness of our expression. The proposed near-field gain expression can be applicable to the near-field measurement and design of millimeter or terahertz radar systems that work in the near-field region.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3286092","National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Space Microwave(grant numbers:6142411032201); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571022,61971022); National Key Laboratory Foundation of China(grant numbers:61424020305); Post-Doctoral Fellows of “Zhuoyue” Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155657","3-D near-field gain;circular aperture antenna;near-field region;steepest descent technique","Aperture antennas;Antennas;Transmitting antennas;Reflector antennas;Radar antennas;Radar;Lighting","","1","","37","IEEE","19 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both traditional and TR algorithms experience errors due to the loss of different types of information. In this communication, we propose an accurate focusing algorithm that combines TR with the vector fitting method. This algorithm effectively solves the limitations of traditional focusing algorithms in problems involving large angles, complex area focusing, and other scenarios. The proposed algorithm has the advantages of being fast, enabling global optimization, and not accumulating errors.
