Reactive loads are chosen as physical implementations. To perform  $N$ -port CMA,  $N$  ports are first added to the lossy and lossless structures to obtain the impedance matrices. Modal efficiencies are then calculated, based on which the locations of the feed and the loads are selected. With the characteristic solutions and one set of modal weighting coefficients (MWCs), where inefficient modes have been excluded, the corresponding loads and radiation pattern can be determined. Afterward, an objective function considering physical implementation and the target pattern is established and optimized. With optimal MWCs, the lumped components loaded at each port are calculated and implemented. The method is applied to an arm-worn smartwatch antenna operating at GPS L1 band, which aims at radiating toward the sky direction for reliable link with satellites. Following the proposed method, the power radiated toward the target area has been increased by more than 40% compared with the original design. The total efficiency is above −6.1 dB when it is worn on a Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) arm. The prototype of the proposed antenna (Prop.

By analyzing the common requirements in the antenna design process, a strategy of calculating the difference between the indicator value and the threshold is applied to construct the objective units that can accurately evaluate the antenna performance and reconstruct the objective functions quickly. The fitness functions can solve the fuzzy requirements problem. An adaptive mechanism is designed for mutation and crossover operation in order to balance the convergence rate and the ability to avoid local extremes. In nondominated sorting, the crowding calculation method is improved so that the individuals can be dispersed in the objective space. A demotion mechanism is designed for the selection operation to balance the importance of all objective functions and constraints. It can not only make the optimal solution closer to the actual requirement but also reduce the computation cost of the algorithm itself.

The proposed method is realized based on a dielectric resonator antenna (DRA). By simultaneously exciting the TM $_{01\delta }$  and HEM $_{21\delta }$  modes of a DRA, a superposed mode with a field pattern analogous to the TE211 mode can be produced. Since both the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX) ports locate at the weak-field regions of the superposed mode, a decoupling performance is therefore obtained without the use of any additional decoupling structures or circuits. For validation, a DRA with artificial electromagnetic boundaries (AEMBs) is employed, so that the TM $_{01\delta }$  and HEM $_{21\delta }$  modes can be simultaneously excited using a simple microstrip proximity coupling. It only needs to properly adjust the geometric parameters of the DRA, and the mutual coupling is substantially suppressed. The experiment demonstrates that the antenna can achieve maximum isolation of 42 dB and peak gain of 8.65 dBi. Due to the simple and integrated architecture, the proposed method is promising for MMW IBFD applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3262339","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61922031,61671485); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090436","Decoupling;dielectric resonator antenna (DRA);full duplex;millimeter-wave (MMW) antenna;mode superposition","Antennas;Dielectric resonator antennas;Couplings;Electromagnetics;Magnetic resonance;Permittivity;Mutual coupling","","17","","37","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By loading stubs at the radiating edge of the patch, the resonance frequency of the TM $_{\mathbf {20}}$  mode is moved down to the same band as the original TM $_{\mathbf {10}}$  mode. Then, the mutual coupling between two such patch antennas is suppressed simply by physical placement, even when they are placed extremely close to each other. Without using any extra decoupling elements, isolation is improved by up to 20 dB using this method. Furthermore, this method can also be applied to multielement multi-input -multi-output (MIMO) array and dual-antenna system with different operating bands. The proposed method is verified with three different application scenarios, including a two-element MIMO array, a two-antenna system with adjacent operating bands, and a four-element MIMO array.

In addition, simulations are performed separately in a three-layer homogenous phantom and a realistic human body model. Measurements of the proposed antenna are evaluated in minced pork. The measured results of the fabricated antenna prototype are closely harmonized with the simulation ones, and the effect of different proportions of fat tissue in pork mince was analyzed to verify the sensitivity of the antenna to the contacting medium. The specific absorption rate (SAR) and link budget calculation are also analyzed. Finally, the wireless biotelemetry function of the proposed antenna is realized and visualized by adopting a pair of nRF24L01 wireless transceivers, and sustainable and stable wireless data transmission characteristics are shown at a high data rate of 2 Mb/s with up to 20-cm transmission distance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3266786","Wellcome Early Concept Development(grant numbers:219390/Z/19/Z); UKRI Horizon Europe Guarantee HORIZON-EIC-PATHFINDERCHALLENGES CROSSBRAIN(grant numbers:GAn.101070908); EU H2020 MSCA-IF WiseCure(grant numbers:GAn.893822); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105226","Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs);dual-band antenna;hemodialysis (HD) applications;implantable antenna;link budget;nRF24L01 transceivers;specific absorption rate (SAR);wireless biotelemetry","Antennas;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Slot antennas;Biomedical telemetry;Bandwidth;Chronic kidney disease","","33","","55","CCBY","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The procedure yields the spatial distribution of the impedance, yet the process involves the synthesis of the equivalent current only. This current is constrained to correspond to a realizable surface impedance, i.e., passive, lossless, and with reactance values bounded by practical realizability limits. The current-based design avoids any solution to the forward problem, and the impedance is obtained from the synthesized current only at the end of the process. The procedure is gradient-based, with the gradient expressed in closed form. This allows handling large metasurfaces, with full spatial variability of the impedance in two dimensions. The method requires no a priori information, and all relevant operations in the iterative process can be evaluated with  $\boldsymbol { O}(N~\log~{N})$  complexity.

The first numerical procedure is based on alternating optimization of positions and amplitudes by means of closed-form convex projectors. Sufficient conditions for the solution to be optimal are established. A second numerical procedure is based on a domino-like sequential determination of the unknowns, which can be iterated to convergence. In addition, analytical asymptotic expressions for the optimal interelement spacing and amplitude are derived by means of variational techniques. The optimal asymptotic interelement spacing is demonstrated to be proportional to the reference tapering to the power ( $- \frac {2}{3}$ ), while the optimal asymptotic array amplitude is proportional to the reference tapering to the power ( $\frac {1}{3}$ ).

To exploit the high reconfigurability of array antennas, multiple synthesis techniques for arrays operating in the NF region have been proposed. Building upon previous works on eigenmode expansions of the radiated fields, two synthesis methods for the excitations of NF arrays based on the definition of an inner product on the electromagnetic fields are investigated: the “maximum norm” and “minimum error field norm” methods. The “maximum norm” method computes the array excitations that maximize either the active power flow through a target surface or the electric/magnetic energy stored in an assigned volume, depending on the adopted inner product. The performance of the maximum active power flow method is compared with one of the simpler conjugate phase methods. Furthermore, the limit solution achieved when the target surface reaches the far-field region is compared against the “maximum beam collection efficiency” method. The “minimum error field norm” method allows to synthesize a given target field. As an example, the latter method is used to find the optimal excitation of a plane wave generator with a spherical quiet zone. The effectiveness and performance of the discussed synthesis methods are validated through numerical simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3247892","Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR) in the framework of the CrossLab Project (Departments of Excellence); FoReLab Project (Departments of Excellence); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054541","Electromagnetic (EM) inner product;Fresnel region;maximum electric energy;maximum power flow;mutual coupling;near-field (NF) array;NF array excitation synthesis;plane wave generator (PWG)","Antenna arrays;Optimization;Noise measurement;Electromagnetics;Scattering parameters;Receiving antennas;Phased arrays","","11","","33","IEEE","28 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aforementioned designs result in non-convex and nonlinear optimization problems, and solutions are derived via the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM).

Various metasurface-based polarization converters successfully demonstrated high efficiency and broad bandwidth. However, new mechanisms to aggressively enhance performance are still in dire need. Here, theoretical and experimental evidence corroborates an efficient ultrawideband transmissive polarization converter based on a topological design method. The triple-layer meta-device consists of a layer of anisotropic zigzag-split resonator array amid two orthogonal wire-grating layers. By splitting double zigzag lines into compound 90° V-shaped resonators, the intraunit cross coupling extends to strong interunit cross coupling, giving birth to the multiresonance enhancement and significant bandwidth broadening. This polarization converter can efficiently convert linearly polarized incident waves into 90° cross-polarized transmitted waves, with a conversion efficiency above 80% over 3.98–22.71 GHz, reaching a fractional bandwidth of 140.4%. The proposed meta-device enables strong cross coupling in mutual transition from intraunit to interunit. From a physical viewpoint, the novel mechanism is elucidated by the surface current and electric field distributions upon constructive interferences stemming from V-shape-resonator combinations and the Fabry–Pérot-like cavity effect. With both spectrum and function extensions, the proposed polarization conversion strategy finds essential applications in polarization-related systematic scenarios, such as 6G communication, radar imaging, anti-interference, and chiral sensing.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3262355","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1801503,2021YFA1401000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U20A20212,61871419,61931006,61901093,61771327,61921002); Open Foundation of Science and Technology on Electronic Information Control Laboratory; Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2020JDRC0028); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project(grant numbers:2017M623000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090419","Metasurface;mutual coupling;polarization;ultrawideband radar","Bandwidth;Metasurfaces;Couplings;Gratings;Resonant frequency;Compounds;Optical resonators","","10","","45","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The PK-DL synthesis method is based on a conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (cDCGAN). First, the metacells are pixelated to offer the higher degrees of design freedom and expand their transmission responses to full 2-D coverage of amplitude and phase responses so that a full-range metacell dataset is built up to simultaneously control the amplitude and phase of a single metacell. Conventionally, by optimizing the dimensions of predefined patterns of a metacell, only the phase response of a single metacell is achieved with a specific amplitude response, and vice versa. The metalens design based on the synthesized metacells has much higher degrees of freedom so that the metalens antenna has the potential to break the ceiling of performance and to realize more functions than existing metalens designs. As examples, two types of single-lens metalens antennas are designed for sidelobe suppression using the proposed metacell dataset. The first metalens is excited by a dipole antenna with an omnidirectional radiation pattern to demonstrate the simultaneous control of amplitude and phase responses using the synthesized metacells. The second metalens fed by a standard horn antenna is designed to suppress the SLLs in both the E- and H-planes. The horn-fed square metalens has an aperture of  $13.2\times 13.2\,\,\lambda _{0}$  at 12 GHz. Measurement shows that the proposed metalens antenna realizes the gain of 26.9 dBi at 12 GHz and the first SLLs in the E- and H-planes are −33.2 and −30.9 dB, respectively.

Based on this method, a bandpass FSS with simultaneous wide passband and wide out-of-band rejection is validated. The MMR unit cell consists of two back-to-back magnetoelectric (ME)-dipole antennas and a filter-embedded GND plane. Four modes are analyzed and used to acquire a wide passband of the FSS. At the same time, wide out-of-band rejections in both lower and upper bands are controlled by the filter-embedded GND plane with four rotationally symmetric quarter-wavelength transmission lines (QWTLs). Moreover, the GND plane plays a crucial role in the impedance matching of the proposed FSS. As a result, four transmission poles (TPs) and three transmission zeros (TZs) of the proposed FSS can be obtained, leading to a fourth-order filtering response and wide out-of-band rejection. An equivalent circuit model, current distributions, and electric field distributions are introduced to illustrate the working mechanism of the FSS.

The in- band scattering and radiation mechanism of an array element is analyzed first. It is found that the antenna input impedance may lead to different effects on the antenna scattering and radiation patterns. Taking advantage of this difference, an array element incorporated with a biased p-i-n diode is designed, which has two scattering states with 180° phase differences but a stable radiation state. By controlling the biasing state of the p-i-n diode connected to each element, the scattering pattern of the proposed array can be manipulated dynamically. Meanwhile, the stable radiation pattern of the designed element ensures that the proposed phased array can dynamically radiate a beam scanning to a given direction with high efficiency during the manipulation of scattering patterns. The final designed linear array with p-i-n diodes is able to operate at 2.6–3.4 GHz with a radiation beam scanning up to ±45°. Moreover, the reconfigurable scattering beams of the proposed array can point to arbitrary angles within ±60°, thus the in- band scattering is significantly reduced in a broad bandwidth. To validate this design, a prototype array is fabricated and measured. Measured results are in good agreement with the simulated results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3264985","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61721001); 111 Project of China(grant numbers:BP0719011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10106781","Antenna scattering;phased array;reconfigurable scattering pattern","Scattering;Phased arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Impedance;PIN photodiodes;Metasurfaces;Loaded antennas","","13","","39","IEEE","21 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, two approaches with a novel model based on conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) are presented to achieve inverse design from the given indexes to FSS physical dimensions.

An integral equation method is developed for reconstructing or imaging such objects using microwave illumination. Since the objects are both dielectric and magnetic, full volume integral equations (VIEs) are needed to describe the problem. The objects can be reconstructed by alternatively solving the forward scattering VIEs (FSVIEs) and the inverse scattering VIEs (ISVIEs) under the Born iterative method (BIM) or distorted BIM (DBIM). The Nyström method is used to solve the FSVIEs while a Gauss–Newton minimization method (GNMM) with a multiplicative regularization scheme (MRS) is used to solve the ISVIE. The Nyström method is more suitable for solving the FSVIEs of inverse problems because it is a point-matching method. To accelerate the solution, the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) is incorporated with the Nyström method which is new for solving inverse problems. Also, using the MRS-based GNMM to solve the ISVIEs can facilitate the selection of regularization parameter and reduce the requirements on measured data.

Several different lossy schemes to incorporate the conductivity terms of lossy media, including exponential time differencing (ETD), averaging, and forward–forward schemes, are integrated into a unified formulation. The proposed leapfrog CDI-FDTD method not only resolves the problem of field leakage but also has complying divergence.

In this article, a 3-D reduced stochastic radial point interpolation method (R-SRPIM) is developed for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in bioelectromagnetics. Derivatives of field quantities in Maxwell’s equations are obtained using the radial basis function, and stochasticity in the EM properties within the model space is incorporated into this formulation. The number of terms in the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and hence the computational complexity increases with large variations. To make the resulting formulation computationally viable, the sparsity of the stochastic matrix is enforced by utilizing the linearization property of the product of three Hermite polynomials and using singular value decomposition (SVD).

However, the electromagnetic (EM) fields in such nonlinear media cannot be easily and accurately calculated by using the traditional computational EM methods due to the nonlinearity of Kerr optical materials in graded-index (GRIN) MMFs. The iterative division method based on the 2.5-D spectral numerical mode matching (SNMM) method is developed to address this problem. The SNMM method is a semianalytical method, which can effectively reduce the computational costs to obtain highly accurate solutions. Starting from the numerical results of SNMM, the iterative division method solves the EM fields of the linear-to-nonlinear transition process together iteratively. In this work, several improvements are proposed to extend the SNMM for Kerr optical nonlinear MMFs. The governing equations with anisotropic permittivity with Kerr optical nonlinear media are established in the cylindrical coordinate system.

The logarithmic derivative method had been proposed to solve this numerical issue with Mie theory successfully, while the numerical issue with SLMT has not been solved fully so far. Computations of reflection and transmission coefficients are the key part of SLMT. In this article, we first define the renormalized reflection and transmission coefficients, which enjoy the feature of having an ordinary level of magnitude. Then, borrowing the idea of the logarithmic derivative method, the expressions for the renormalized canonical reflection and transmission coefficients as well as other terms in the theory are rearranged.

This article concerns efficient MoM analysis of large antenna arrays with identical disjoint elements in arbitrary layouts. The domain Green’s function method (DGFM) is a domain decomposition method (DDM) for such arrays. Its unique benefit is that only local problems are solved to obtain an approximate global solution. Its main drawback is uncontrolled, problem-dependent solution errors. An improved scheme denoted iterative radius-based DGFM (IRB-DGFM) is formulated, in standard and residual-driven (RD) versions.

This method retains the nonconformal mesh and the implicit–explicit time integration scheme. The WE-FETD region is based on the wave equation rather than Maxwell’s curl equations. This method needs to store all the electric fields in the entire region and only the magnetic fields on the interface, which can prominently reduce degrees of freedom (DoFs) and save calculation time. The ME-FDTD region follows Yee’s scheme. A Maxwell’s equations spectral element time-domain (ME-SETD) region and a virtual region are used to combine the ME-FDTD and WE-FETD regions. Consequently, a WE-FETD/ME-SETD/Virtual/ME-FDTD framework is formed. Hybrid Newmark-beta (NB) and Crank–Nicolson (CN) time stepping are employed for implicit WE-FETD and ME-SETD regions. The leapfrog (LF) time integration is used for the explicit virtual and FDTD regions. At the interface, it employs upwind flux in the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to couple neighboring regions. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. Several cases exhibit the improved efficiency compared with the hybrid FDTD/FETD method only based on Maxwell’s equations and the pure FETD method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3268732","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:92166107); Stable Operation Project; National Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2019-VIII-0009-0170); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10108944","Hybrid method;hybrid Newmark-beta (NB) and Crank-Nicolson (CN) time stepping;Maxwell’s equations finite-difference time-domain (ME-FDTD) method;wave equation-based finite-element time-domain (WE-FETD) method","Time-domain analysis;Finite element analysis;Finite difference methods;Mathematical models;Propagation;Maxwell equations;Couplings","","6","","33","IEEE","25 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the amount of transmitted data increases, the low-rank characteristic of the line-of-sight (LoS) channel severely limits the growth of channel capacity in the point-to-point backhaul transmission scenario. Orbital angular momentum (OAM), also known as vortex beam, is considered as a potentially effective solution for high-capacity LoS wireless transmission. However, due to the shortcomings of its energy divergence and the specificity of multimode divergence angles, OAM beams have been difficult to apply in practical communication systems for a long time. In this work, a novel multimode convergent transmission with a co-scale reception scheme is proposed. OAM beams of different modes can be transmitted with the same beam divergent angle, while the wavefronts are tailored by the ring-shaped Airy compensation lens during propagation, so that the energy will converge to the same spatial area for receiving. Based on this scheme, not only is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greatly improved but it is also possible to simultaneously receive and demodulate OAM channels multiplexed with different modes in a limited space area. Through prototype experiments, we demonstrated that three kinds of OAM modes are tunable, and different channels can be separated simultaneously with receiving power increasing. The measurement isolations between channels are over 11 dB, which ensures a reliable 16-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) multiplexing wireless transmission demo system. This work may explore the potential applications of OAM-based multimode convergent transmission in LoS wireless communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3263920","National Research Foundation, Singapore, and Infocomm Media Development Authority under its Future Communications Research and Development Program(grant numbers:FCP-NTU-RG-2021-015); Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) under its Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Industry Alignment Fund Pre-Positioning (IAF-PP)(grant numbers:A19D6a0053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10097626","Airy beam;line-of-sight (LoS) channel;orbital angular momentum (OAM);OAM multimode;wireless communication","Wireless communication;Multiplexing;Backhaul networks;Generators;Antenna radiation patterns;Space vehicles;Signal to noise ratio","","32","","43","IEEE","7 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study extends the use of the WS time delay matrix to systems composed of dispersive and lossy materials. Specifically, it shows that such systems’ WS time delay matrix can be expressed by augmenting the previously derived expressions with terms that account for the dispersive and lossy nature of the system, followed by a transformation that disentangles effects of losses from time delays.

The new method is based on the Born approximation and has features: 1) a scattered field including not only a far-field (FF) but also a near-field (NF) can be predicted from measured NF samples, where the measurement distances from a target under test to the TX and RX can be different; 2) the scattered field with a zero bistatic angle and the field with the nonzero bistatic angle where the MBET holds can be predicted; 3) the computational time is practical for a large target; and 4) the implementation of the code is easy.

The path loss (PL) of five links and the surface variations both in Mulan’s area of high wind speed (WS) and eye were recorded. The average PL of a 53-km link was approximately 155 dB in the high WS area, while a 30 dB increase in PL was detected in Mulan’s eye.

When objects or vehicles are moving, which is the case of industrial or vehicular environments, multiple successive representations of the environment (“snapshots”) and multiple RT runs are often necessary, which require a great human effort and a great deal of computation resources. Recently, the dynamic RT (DRT) approach has been proposed to predict the multipath evolution within a given time lapse on the base of the current multipath geometry, assuming constant speeds and/or accelerations for moving objects, using analytical extrapolation formulas. This is done without rerunning a full RT for every “snapshot” of the environment, therefore with a great reduction in both human labor and computation time. When DRT is embedded in a mobile radio system and used in real time, ahead-of-time (or anticipative) field prediction is possible, which opens the way to interesting applications. In the present work, a full-3-D DRT algorithm is presented, which allows to account for multiple reflections, edge diffraction, and diffuse scattering for the general case where moving objects can translate and rotate. For the purpose of validation, the model is first applied to some ideal cases and then to realistic cases where results are compared with conventional RT simulation and measurements available in the literature.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3262155","European Union under the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) of NextGenerationEU, partnership on “Telecommunications of the Future”(grant numbers:PE00000001—program “RESTART”); Eu COST Action Intelligence-Enabling Radio Communications for Seamless Inclusive Interactions (INTERACT)(grant numbers:CA20120); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10089404","6G mobile communications;Doppler effect;dynamic ray tracing (DRT);millimeter-wave (mm-wave) propagation;radiowave propagation;ray tracing (RT);vehicular ad hoc networks","Vehicle dynamics;Ray tracing;Reflection;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamics;Diffraction;Prediction algorithms","","14","","28","IEEE","30 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the GBSC model, the power angle of arrival (AoA) spectrum of a cluster depends on the power angle of departure-Doppler (AoD-Doppler) spectrum. Hence, this model is non-Kronecker structured. In over-the-air (OTA) testing, the prefaded signal synthesis (PFS) method is valid for emulating the GBSC to measure devices under test (DUTs). However, the emulated channel under the conventional PFS method is a Kronecker case due to the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) fading sequences between probes when synthesizing clusters. It will lead to inaccurate link characteristics for emulation. Therefore, a non-Kronecker structured PFS (NKSPFS) method is proposed. Specifically, the rays mapped to probes are individually weighted to ensure that fading sequences between probes are independent but not identically distributed. To determine the ray weights without degrading marginal correlations for emulation, the constraints are introduced on the deviation between the target spatial–temporal correlation and the emulated spatial–temporal correlation according to the emulated spatial correlation and temporal correlation. Simulation results show that the proposed NKSPFS method outperforms the conventional PFS method in OTA testing of multi-antenna devices.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3263589","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971067); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10093833","Channel emulation;joint spatial–temporal correlation;Kronecker structure;over-the-air (OTA);prefaded signal synthesis (PFS)","Correlation;Antennas;Probes;Antenna arrays;Emulation;Fading channels;Testing","","1","","29","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs) support EM waves with strong field confinements, giving rise to the time delay of signals. Due to the flexible dispersion behaviors, SSPPs can be engineered at will by designing the plasmonic structure parameters. Benefitting from these characteristics, here we propose a multimode and reconfigurable SSPP PS loaded with varactor diodes. By controlling the dispersion behaviors, phase differences between different SSPP modes can be realized, and the phase shift of each mode can be reconfigured. Experimental results show that the proposed SSPP PS can achieve about 240°, 241°, and 340° phase shifts among the fundamental (even) modes, the high-order (odd) modes, and the fundamental and high-order modes, respectively, by switching the bias voltages applied to the varactors. Additionally, the proposed SSPP PS has the capability to continuously tune the phase difference in each mode. Simulations and measurements have a good consistency. This work lays the groundwork for SSPP applications in large-scale integrated circuits and wireless communication systems and has a promising application in Terahertz circuits.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3262348","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700201,2017YFA0700202,2017YFA0700203); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62288101,61871127,61890544,61801117,61722106,61701107,61701108,61701246,61735010,61731010); Major Project of Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20212002); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:111-2-05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090437","multimode;phase shifter (PS);spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs)","Capacitance;Phase shifters;Varactors;Dispersion;Behavioral sciences;Cutoff frequency;Surface plasmon polaritons","","13","","35","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inspired by the PCSC PAA, this communication proposes a PAA based on heterogeneous beam elements (HBEs) to realize wide-angle scanning. Using HBEs introduces a new design degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely the element beam shape, to PAA. By optimizing HBEs and their arrangement, the effective aperture of a PAA can be increased at large scanning angles, and thus the scanning range can be improved. To verify the idea, first, a wide-beam  $1\times4$ -element subarray is developed. Then, a standard  $4\times4$ -element PAA is implemented using four uniform  $1\times4$ -element subarrays, achieving a  $>\pm 60^{\circ }$  3-dB gain variation scanning range. At last, based on the standard PAA, by adjusting its structure to tailor four subarrays’ beam inclinations, a  $4\times4$ -element HBE PAA is designed. It further improves the scanning range to  $>\pm 70^{\circ }$  at an average cost of ~1.5 dBi broadside scanning gain within the 5G mmWave band (24.25–29.5 GHz, 19.5%).

It is shown that the misaligned field exhibits unique sequence-based features for different misalignment information. Consequently, the recurrent neural network (RNN), a powerful method to deal with sequential data, is introduced to extract its intrinsic features and estimate the misalignment values. To further reduce the total number of parameters as well as to improve the performance, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) is employed to construct the recurrent layer. As far as we know, this is the first use of deep learning for the estimation of the OAM misalignment information in radio frequency (RF). The setup of the training data and the performance of the proposed model under four different misalignment cases are demonstrated. To further validate the reliability of the proposed models, the trained model is evaluated on the sample carrying 20% Gaussian noise. Furthermore, the effects of the position deviation and the number of samples are also investigated. Besides, the comparison with other methods is presented. It is illustrated that the tailored model can reach the same measurement resolution as the previous literature while requiring only one-eighth of the sampling points.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3263945","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971115,61721001,61971099); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10097525","Antenna radiation pattern;deep learning;misalignment measurement;orbital angular momentum (OAM);recurrent neural network (RNN)","Transmitters;Receivers;Logic gates;Recurrent neural networks;Estimation;Feature extraction;Extraterrestrial measurements","","4","","30","IEEE","7 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
