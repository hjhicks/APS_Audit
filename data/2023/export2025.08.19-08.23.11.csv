A pair of centrosymmetric printed  $ {\Gamma }$ -shaped strips serve as a CP electric source, and a modified narrow slot with two etched centrosymmetric stubs can be treated as a CP magnetic source. The combination of them can provide a wide 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth. Operating mechanism of the proposed CP radiating element is investigated and provided. Two differently constructed CP arrays, i.e., a sequentially rotated  $4\times4$  CP array and a full-corporate fed  $8\times8$  CP array, are then designed based on the proposed CP radiating element, to confirm the expandability of the proposed CP radiating element. Prototypes of these two arrays were fabricated and measured. According to the measured data, the sequentially rotated fed  $4\times4$  CP array exhibits an impedance bandwidth ( $\vert S_{11}\vert < -10$  dB) better than 57.1% (i.e., 25–45 GHz), a 3 dB AR bandwidth better than 31.4% (i.e., 29–40 GHz), and a maximum gain of 16.4 dBic, while the corresponding results for the full-corporate fed  $8\times8$  CP array are 25.8% (i.e., 29–37.5 GHz), 19.1% (i.e., 29.8–36 GHz), and 24.3 dBic.

Based on the equivalent model of a rotating magnetic dipole, the principles of the EM transmission underwater and across the interface of water and air are analyzed. ELF wave propagating underwater in the adjacent area was stronger and decays slowly, which was certificated by the experiment and simulation. Thus, the long-range transmission underwater in the ELF band with digital coding modulation based on the UEMTA is realized, and the longest distance can reach 210 m underwater in the experiment. The transmission of ELF wave across water–air medium based on the system is also tested by the experiment too. The long-range transmission of digital coding modulation across the water–air interface is realized with the longest distance of about 210 m.

This article proposes a radiative near field power transfer (RNF-PT) system comprising an intraoral differential rectenna (rectifying antenna) and external power transmitter (RNF-Tx). A dual-band compact differential intraoral antenna operating in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band (2.45 GHz) and midfield band (1.9 GHz) is proposed for the data and power transmission modes, respectively. The proposed differential antenna and rectifier were designed and fabricated individually using a Rogers RT/duroid 6010 substrate. The differential rectifier shows a simulated conversion efficiency of 89.3% for a radio frequency (RF) input power of 14.78 dBm at 1.9 GHz with a 2  $\text{k}\Omega $  load. The maximum transmission coefficient of −25.95 and −24.93 dB was achieved at a separation of 22 mm for the closed and opened mouth conditions, respectively. The measured impedance bandwidths of the proposed antenna in both the closed and open mouth of the test subject are around 10% in the midfield band and around 9.5% in the ISM band, respectively. The measured peak gain in the minced pork and saline solution was −20.48 dBic, −18.25 dBic at the frequency of 1.9 GHz and −18.54 dBi, and −16.88 dBi at the frequency of 2.45 GHz, respectively. The specific absorption rate (SAR) values have also been analyzed through simulations for both data and power transmission modes and are found acceptable in the closed and open mouth placements. Based on these acceptable SAR values, the link margin was theoretically calculated where it could communicate over a reasonable distance. Thus, the proposed intraoral differential antenna with a rectifier is ideal for data and PT support in iTDS-based applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3232723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10006719","Assistive technology;differentially fed;Industrial;Scientific and Medical (ISM) band;intraoral tongue drive system (iTDS);link margin;miniaturization;radiative near field (RNF);rectifier;specific absorption rate (SAR)","Antennas;Tongue;Dual band;Radio frequency;Mouth;Transmitting antennas;Rectennas","","7","","38","IEEE","4 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The loss of the benzocyclobutene (BCB)-based coplanar waveguide with ground (CPWG) to PCB-based SIW transition is investigated and measured to interconnect and integrate the antenna array with other components. The performance of the SIW-based slot antenna is enhanced about 2 dB without extra feeding networks by using a novel method of parasitic folded patches, and the fractional impedance bandwidth is increased from 10% to 15% by changing the metallic posts besides the SIW.

First, the mutual coupling between radiators is characterized by lossy J/K inverters, and the analysis with circuit models shows that the traditional lumped loading method can only suppress the mutual susceptance. Particularly, the decoupling will not be ultimate unless the mutual conductance is further eliminated, which requires equal modal conductance of the odd and even modes of the antenna pair. After that, a method based on antenna-shape modification is proposed, and three types of antennas are designed with characteristic mode analysis (CMA). As for the single-band and wideband patch antenna pairs, by changing the patch shape into a parallelogram and adjusting the patch angle, the modal conductance of the odd and even modes are regulated to be equal, and the isolation is thus significantly improved when compared with the traditional ones to be loaded with lumped elements. As for the inverted-F antenna (IFA) pair, enhanced isolation is achieved by changing the bending configuration, coupling gap, and ground length of the antenna. Good agreement between simulated and measured results shows that all these antennas have achieved isolation over 20 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3235013","Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission; Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808115411853,KQT20180D412181337494); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001124); Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; General Program(grant numbers:61971475); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:0085/2020/AMJ); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFE0205900); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10016291","Antenna decoupling;characteristic mode analysis (CMA);coupled resonators;J/K inverter;modal conductance;mutual conductance","Couplings;Antennas;Resonant frequency;Inverters;Integrated circuit modeling;Transconductance;Resonators","","17","","55","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach is based on a new element mutation method which is proposed for mutating the position of any element within the aperture without changing the position of other elements. Because a mutating element can be thought of as being placed inside the board like a black/white stone in go or crawling somewhere nearby like a caterpillar, we call it go-caterpillar-mutation (GCM).

It indicates that the introduction of the NSCBs fundamentally changes the working principle of the TCA and makes it operate like an electromagnetic combined antenna. Arms of the array elements, the short-circuited branches (SCBs), together with the ground plane, compose current loops, which act as magnetic dipoles, and the array elements themselves are electric dipoles, so the TCA becomes an array of electromagnetic combined dipoles in theory. Thus, the backplane short-circuited effect (BSE) and the edge truncation effect (ETE), which limit the working band of the TCA, are avoided simultaneously. Therefore, the working band of TCA remarkably improves, so that it can be applied to radiate the ultrawideband (UWB) pulses with band ratio over 10:1. Then, based on the theory of electromagnetic combined dipoles, the TCA with NSCBs is designed and optimized. A practical such TCA integrated with feeding baluns is developed and measured. The developed TCA with NSCBs has a working band of 287 MHz–6.45 GHz, and the band ratio is 22.5:1. The distance between the array and the ground plate is 20 mm, and the total height of the array antenna is 35 mm, which is only 3.4% of the wavelength of the lower cutoff frequency, which makes a low-profile UWB antenna. Finally, the TCA is excited by a UWB pulse with an amplitude of 3.06 kV, and the performance is measured and calculated in the pulse mode. It indicates that the UWB pulse radiating system has an effective potential of 3.54 kV, and the effective potential gain is 1.16.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3240624","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52007140); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10035927","Combined antenna;electromagnetic pulse;tightly coupled array (TCA);ultrawideband (UWB) pulsed antenna","Bandwidth;Impedance;Antenna arrays;Finite element analysis;Ultra wideband antennas;Loaded antennas;Horn antennas","","9","","22","IEEE","2 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the HP direction, a rotatable stacked substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW)-to-coaxial-to-SIW transition (SCST) is meticulously designed to yield omnidirectional radiation with low gain variations and low transmission loss. As for the VP direction, two orthogonal substrates that are arranged above the VP radiating element act as a holder to fix the director, resulting in gain enhancement.

Moreover, the top-hat-shaped metal fence collaborates with the large-size ground plane to yield dual conical beams with high gain in DP directions. From the measured results, the HP direction has exhibited desirable bandwidth of 11.4% (24.8–27.8 GHz) with a peak gain of 11.6 dBi, and the VP direction has demonstrated wider bandwidth of 13.7% (24.5–28.1 GHz) with a corresponding gain up to 8.1 dBi.

PMMAs use large-volume permanent magnets to enhance the signal, posing a significant challenge to power consumption of the mechanical drive structure. We optimize the permanent magnets in terms of magnetization structure, magnetic material, and form factor to determine the optimal permanent magnet structure. We establish an analytical model of the magnetic torque of the array elements and the radiated field of the array to determine the optimal array form. Based on the analytical model, we analyze the effects of the array element spacing, the phase difference of the array elements, and the number of array elements on the radiated time-varying magnetic field. Finally, a 3-D array prototype operating in the frequency band of 75–125 Hz is developed for testing. The test results show that when the phase difference is less than  $\mathrm{26}^{\circ} $ , the effect on the radiation intensity of the array is negligible. When the array element spacing is 0.15 m, the motor cannot drive the mechanical structure, and when the array element spacing increases to 0.3 m, it can operate normally.

Such a small Section height results in a severely reduced radiation efficiency and a narrowed bandwidth. In this article, the enhancement of radiation efficiency and bandwidth of a millimeter-wave (mmWave) patch antenna with 20  $\mu \text{m}$  profile height are studied. On the metal GND, by properly opening two (or one) resonant slots with a width of 100  $\mu \text{m}$ , strong resonance coupling between the patch antenna and the slots can be induced, leading to a greatly enhanced radiation efficiency.

However, the difficulty of controlling the reflected amplitude of the widely studied 1-bit reflectarray (RA) makes it difficult to meet the requirements of RIS for multiple application scenarios, and the change of the operating frequency in emerging time modulation (TM) technology-based RAs makes them unsuited to existing systems. Considering the observed the intrinsic similarities between the reflection states of 1-bit RA and logic states of 1-bit time function, a 1-bit time-modulated RA (1-bit TMRA) was designed based on a conventional 1-bit RA and TM technology in this study, and then was verified experimentally. The 1-bit RA characteristic was verified by realizing beam scanning, and the TM characteristic was verified by a shaping scattering pattern with ultralow sidelobe levels (SLLs). The results show that the proposed 1-bit TMRA is capable of realizing an extra TM characteristic without significantly increasing the system complexity of the 1-bit RA. Unlike most time-modulated arrays, the proposed 1-bit TMRA operates at the center frequency, making it suitable for direct application in existing wireless communication systems.

By judicious choice of periodicity and angles of incidence, scattering off such an MG can be described via a multiport network, where the input and output ports correspond to different illumination and reflection directions associated with the same set of propagating Floquet–Bloch (FB) modes. Since each of these possible scattering scenarios can be modeled analytically, constraints can be conveniently applied on the modal reflection coefficients (scattering matrix entries) to yield a diffusive response, which, when resolved, produce the required MG geometry. We show that by demanding a symmetric MG configuration, the number of independent S parameters can be dramatically reduced, enabling satisfaction of multiple such constraints using a single sparse MG. Without any full-wave optimization, this procedure results in a fabrication-ready layout of a multichannel MG, enabling retroreflection suppression and diffusive scattering from numerous angles of incidence simultaneously. This concept, verified experimentally via a five-channel MG prototype, offers an innovative solution to both monostatic and bistatic radar cross Section (RCS) reduction, avoiding design and implementation challenges associated with dense metasurfaces used for this purpose.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3234656","Israel Science Foundation(grant numbers:1540/18); Peter Munk Research Institute (PMRI), Technion; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10017186","Diffusers;Floquet-Bloch (FB);metagratings (MGs);multichannel;multifunctionality;radar cross section (RCS);scattering","Scattering;Wires;Radar cross-sections;Radar scattering;Nonhomogeneous media;Metasurfaces;Interference","","7","","50","IEEE","13 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Measured results indicate that the wide beamwidth patterns show flat-top and sharp cutoff performance. Both E-plane and H-plane patterns draw low cross polarization (smaller than −22 dB). Another prototype, aiming to verify the beam-scanning capability, is investigated. Measured results demonstrate the performances of the proposed antennas.

The proposed technique eliminates the need for mechanical steering of reflectors for satellite communication. A small mechanical movement of a patterned dielectric structure under multislot elements achieves beam steering by changing the coupling. Due to the unique shape of the multislot element, the unit cell is capable of tuning the phase for both linear polarization and circular polarization (CP) within a single design operating at 20 GHz. The maximum phase range obtained in this design is a continuous 280° for RHCP, LHCP, and two linear polarizations at 20 GHz. The phase of the reconfigurable unit cell is verified and measured using a waveguide simulator attached to a micromotor. Maximum element loss is simulated to be 0.5 dB. To demonstrate beam steering, three reflectarrays with frozen dielectrics and square array lattices composed of 400 elements ( $10\lambda _{0}\,\,\times 10\lambda _{0}$ ) are fabricated. The frozen reflectarrays demonstrate beams at 0°, 15°, and 30°. The measured gain is found to be 23.2 dB at broadside with 21.8 and 23.3 dB, respectively, when scanned to 15° and 30°. The 1 dB gain bandwidth is measured to be 7.45% with a 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth of 12.1%.

By loading the metasurface on the DR, a low-profile DR radiator is developed. To realize both phase and pattern digital coding, a beam-switching metasurface-loaded 1 bit DR antenna is explored by using a symmetrical feeding scheme and a Yagi-like endfire radiation mechanism. The novel hybrid digital coding method is realized by using p-i-n diodes to co-control the phase (1 bit, 0°/180°) and radiation states (three-beam). Based on the hybrid digital coding method, the developed 1-D linear array creatively achieves low-cost quasi-2-D discrete beam scanning. The pattern reconfiguration technique contributes to the E-plane beam scanning, while the H-plane beam steering is attributed to the phase digital coding sequence. To validate this working mechanism, a four-element linear array is implemented and tested. The realized overlapped −10 dB impedance bandwidth is about 17.6% (covering LTE B42/43 bands), and the realized peak gain is 9.05 dBi. By controlling the switch states of 16 p-i-n diodes, the proposed four-element linear array achieves digital 2-D beam steering (12 beams).

In this work, first, we consider quadratic approximations for the phase term of the PO scattered fields. Second, the linear amplitude of the PO scattered fields [linear-fast PO (L-FPO)] is proposed. The simplification of the linear amplitude term is adopted for two reasons. One is that the contributions of the PO scattered fields mainly come from the high-frequency critical points, that is, the stationary phase points, the boundary phase points, and the vertex points. When the wave frequency goes large, the linearization of the amplitude term could guarantee the accuracy of the PO scattered fields from the high-frequency critical points. The other reason is that the L-FPO method proposed in this work avoids the time-consuming and complicated calculation of Fresnel integrals. The computational cost of the Fresnel integrals is shrunk drastically. For the aircraft model, the CPU time of the proposed method is reduced by one order of magnitude compared with Gordon’s method and nearly half compared with the Q-FPO method.

When modeling inhomogeneous objects with high complex permittivities at low frequencies, the traditional D-VIE is ill-conditioned and suffers from numerical instabilities that result in slower convergence and less accurate solutions. In this work, we address these shortcomings by leveraging a new set of volume quasi-Helmholtz projectors. Their scaling by the material permittivity matrix allows for the rebalancing of the equation when applied to inhomogeneous scatterers and, thereby, makes the proposed method accurate and stable even for high complex permittivity objects until arbitrarily low frequencies.

Furthermore, there has not been sufficient research on the quality of the solution as a function of the accuracy of the iterative solver. We present an error analysis of the approximated solution considering both the reduced number of RHSs and the tolerance of the iterative solver. Based on the error analysis, a new angular sweep algorithm is proposed with fine-tuned tolerances of the iterative solver for individual singular vectors. The different tolerances for each singular vector increase the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Another benefit of the proposed algorithm is that the error can be bounded by a user-defined global tolerance. In addition, a variant of the generalized conjugate residual method for multiple RHSs is introduced to accelerate iterative solvers. Finally, numerical validation is conducted with three examples in which the discontinuous Galerkin surface integral equation method is applied.

In order to remedy the drawback of full-structure CMs and then expand the application scope of CMA, we herein propose a generalized surface integral equation (SIE)-based sub-structure CM formulation for composite objects with arbitrary metallic-dielectric combinations. For the computation of sub-structure CMs, the composite object is handily decomposed into two parts with different functions, namely, the main radiator and passive loading. The distinctive feature of the sub-structure CMs is to accurately capture the resonant modes that belong to the main radiator in the presence of the passive loading.

A numerical calculation of the shortest ray path (geodesic) using an open-source library helps quantify the phase of the electric field in the lens aperture, while the amplitude is evaluated by applying ray-tube power conservation theory. The Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction formula is then employed to compute the far field of the lens antenna. This approach is validated by comparing the radiation patterns of a transversely compressed geodesic Luneburg lens (elliptical base instead of circular) with the ones computed using commercial full-wave simulators, demonstrating a substantial reduction in computational resources. The proposed method is then used in combination with an optimization procedure to study possible compact alternatives of the geodesic Luneburg lens with size reduction in both the transverse and vertical directions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3233643","Office of Naval Research (ONR)(grant numbers:N62909-20-1-2040); MCIN/AEI /10.13039/501100011033(grant numbers:PID2020-116739GB-I00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10012580","geodesic-lenses;lens antennas;non-euclidean transformation optics;parallel plate waveguides (PPWs);ray tracing","Lenses;Optical surface waves;Antennas;Electronic mail;Electron tubes;Surface waves;Ray tracing","","38","","61","CCBY","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For large-scale PL, comparisons are conducted among the free space model, the two-ray model, the parabolic equation model (PEM), and the log-distance model with the measured PL data. The results show that the log-distance model agrees well with the general trend of the measured data, whereas the PEM has a better ability to capture the variations of the interference nulls. In addition, the free space model and the two-ray model have larger deviation from the empirical data, implying that they are not suitable for the desired scenario. For small-scale fading, various distributions are considered to fit the fading. Based on the criteria of Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics, the Rician distribution has the best goodness of fit, compared with the Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Welbull, or lognormal distributions.

Movement of the TX, RX, both and/or objects in the surrounding environment means that channel conditions may transition between LoS and NLoS leading to a third state of signal propagation, namely, quasi-LoS (QLoS). Unfortunately, this state is largely ignored in the analysis of signal propagation in wireless channels. We, therefore, propose a new statistical framework that unifies signal propagation for LoS, NLoS, and QLoS channel conditions, leading to the creation of the three-state model (TSM). The TSM has a strong physical motivation, whereby the signal propagation mechanisms underlying each state are considered to be similar to those responsible for Rician fading. However, in the TSM, the dominant signal component, if present, can be subject to shadowing. To support the use of the TSM, we develop novel formulations for the probability density functions of the in-phase and quadrature components of the complex received signal, the received signal envelope, and the received signal phase. In addition, we derive an expression for the complex autocorrelation function of the TSM, which will be of particular importance in understanding and simulating its time correlation properties. Finally, we show that the TSM provides a good fit to field measurements obtained for two different body-centric wireless channels operating at 2.45 GHz, which are known to be subject to the phenomena underlying the TSM.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3231686","State Research Agency [Agencia Estatal de Investigación (AEI)] of Spain; European Social Fund(grant numbers:RYC2020-030536-I); AEI(grant numbers:PID2020-118139RB-I00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10003238","Body-centric communications;channel characterization;multimodal;nonisotropic;shadowed fading;statistics;time-series analysis","Wireless communication;Nonlinear optics;Rician channels;Shadow mapping;Markov processes;Adaptation models;Rayleigh channels","","2","","59","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results show that multieffects of the plasma sheath, including the high-density, strong-collision, wide-dispersion, subwavelength thickness, etc., can synergistically affect the transmission and scattering characteristics. EM signals of control and communication are then reflected, transmitted, or absorbed differently in various parameter regimes of the plasma sheath.

While several single methods to improve WPT efficiency have been reported, the lack of integrality in these single methods limits the effect of the improvements. In this investigation, we analyze the physical process of a typical WPT scenario and find that the high propagation loss consisting of in-tissue attenuation and interface reflection degrades the WPT performance. A systematic method to comprehensively improve WPT efficiency is then proposed. Specifically, a Fresnel zone plate (FZP) is applied against the attenuation of inner biological tissue, and a practical air layer-artificial matching layer (AL-AML) is applied to decrease the reflection on the surface of biological tissue. According to a simulation of possible analytical models, the efficiency is significantly improved when using the proposed method. In an experiment with an implant depth of 20 mm, the proposed systematic method is found to enhance maximum relative received power by 12 dB, with an almost 15-fold increase in efficiency over the conventional system with just a transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx). It is also verified that the improvement in efficiency is greater in the systematic method than in single methods. Also, various misalignment tolerances between the proposed structures and the Rx are determined from the coupling strength of the proposed WPT system.

In this method, probe compensation is not needed, owing to the fact that the measurement procedure is the same as that for FF. It is only required that the measurement distance for an antenna under test (AUT) satisfies the FF and QFF conditions for its smaller and larger dimensions, respectively. To validate the proposed method, a 45° polarized antenna array and a phased array have been simulated.

High-gains are achieved based on the parabolic reflectors (PRs) that can collimate the electromagnetic (EM) wave radiated from the feeds at the focal points. In contrast to the full metal-based PR in the sub-6-GHz band, the mm-wave PR is implemented using periodic metal gratings, which shows a bandgap in the mm-wave band while allowing the sub-6-GHz EM wave free to pass. In this way, the sub-6-GHz and mm-wave parabolic antennas share the same radiating aperture with near 100% aperture reuse efficiency and tiny mutual interference. Multiple mm-wave feeds are used to achieve multibeam radiation without a complicated feed network.

Under the normal co-polarized (co-pol) incident waves, the reflections of the two Vivaldi elements are close in magnitude but out of phase. Hence, the scattering of the two elements cancels out in the normal direction. Besides, the problem of obvious bistatic SCS peaks, which always arise when utilizing the phase cancellation method to achieve SCS reduction (SCSR), is solved by the interlacing arrangement of the two elements. Under the cross-polarized (cr-pol) incident waves, the incident power is mostly received and absorbed by the absorbing array, which is composed of the dipole elements in the array center and the slot elements on two edges.

The conventional approaches for solving inhomogeneous EMIS problems generally have to consider inhomogeneous Green’s functions or conduct approximation operations to media, which inevitably introduces various challenges, including complex mathematical derivation, high computation cost, unavoidable nonlinearity, and even strong ill-posedness. To avoid these challenges, we propose a DL approach based on the complex-valued deep convolutional neural networks (DConvNets), which comprise the deep convolutional encoder–decoder (DCED) structure. Its training data are collected based on the simple synthetic dataset. While the scattered fields received in the measurement domain are utilized as the input for the encoder to extract feature fragments, the final output for the counterpart decoder is the contrasts (permittivities) of dielectric scatterers in the target domain. In this way, unlike the conventional methods, the unknown domain between the target domain and measurement domain never has to be considered to compute inhomogeneous Green’s functions. Consequently, the inhomogeneous EMIS problems could be solved with higher accuracy even for extremely high-contrast targets. Numerical examples illustrate the feasibility of the proposed DL approach. It acts as a new candidate for solving EMIS problems in inhomogeneous media.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3239185","Hong Kong Research Grant Council General Research Fund (GRF)(grant numbers:12300218,12300519,17201020,17300021,C1013-21GF,C7004-21GF); Joint Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)–Research Grants Council (RGC)(grant numbers:N-HKU76921); Fellowship Award from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:HKU PDFS2122-7S05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10028725","Deep learning (DL);electromagnetic inverse scattering (EMIS);high-contrast scatterer;inhomogeneous media","Nonhomogeneous media;Electromagnetic interference;Decoding;Mathematical models;Green's function methods;Receivers;Electromagnetic scattering","","11","","37","IEEE","27 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To meet the given specified antenna requirements or constraints, heuristic algorithms are often used to optimize the connection states for the hardwires between pixels, which are usually assumed to have the binary states, “short” or “open”. An alternative optimization strategy is proposed in this work, where the Boolean constraints on the hardwires are first relaxed to continuously tunable resistances and the globally convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA) is applied to optimize the resistances. To speed up the computation, the adjoint method is used to simplify the calculation of the gradient information required in GCMMA. Resistances that are found as being above or below a certain threshold are then judged as “open” or “short”, respectively. Finally, the remaining intermediate resistance states are binarized using the successive exhaustive Boolean optimization (SEBO) method. Four different optimization strategies are proposed in terms of the objective function implemented in GCMMA and whether the second-stage SEBO is iterative or not. Two broadband endfire pixel antennas having horizontal linear polarization and high radiation efficiency are designed and fabricated correspondingly to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed methods.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3240563","Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:16207620); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071211); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10035928","Adjoint method;method of moving asymptotes (MMA);pixel antenna optimization","Optimization;Antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Impedance;Broadband antennas;Linear programming;Resistance","","8","","37","IEEE","2 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Suppressing White-Noise Interference for Orbital Angular Momentum Waves via the Forward–Backward Dynamic Mode Decomposition","Y. Zhang; L.

To address this issue, we extend the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method to suppress white-noise interferences of OAM by using the forward–backward DMD (FBDMD) approach. The FBDMD-based scheme retrieves the noise-free DMD mapping matrix corresponding to the actual OAM’s topological charges by combining the forward and backward DMD mapping matrix in the noisy environment and consequently reduces the crosstalk, particularly for sorting the superposed OAM modes. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach. It is found that the white-noise interference can be significantly suppressed in sorting the OAM modes process compared with previous works. Also, FBDMD is feasible for the whole aperture receiving and partial aperture receiving (PAR). This work offers a practical tool for OAM coaxial demultiplexing in a noisy environment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3228645","Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Startup Fund(grant numbers:2619006); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:GRF 17209918); Hong Kong University Grants Committee(grant numbers:AoE/P-04/08); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9991973","Antinoise dynamic mode decomposition (DMD);demultiplexing;denoise;orbital angular momentum (OAM)","Transmission line matrix methods;Apertures;AWGN;Demultiplexing;Noise measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Crosstalk","","10","","26","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pure water as the lossy material is utilized in our work due to its high-dielectric loss and easy accessibility. In addition, 16 water-based unit cells with different parameters are selected according to optimized multielement phase cancellation (OMEPC). The best backward scattering reduction can thus be acquired since the combination of different unit cells can achieve the desired phase difference condition in ultrawideband. The 3-D radar cross-sectional (RCS) patterns and the ratio of energy dissipation demonstrate that the ultrawideband and ultralow backward scattering of the proposed design is due to the combined effect of absorption and diffusion. The simulated 10 dB (15 dB) RCS reduction bandwidth is from 2 to 100 GHz (9.7–100 GHz). The RCS reduction results can maintain stable under wide-angle incidence up to 60°. Finally, a prototype with  $4\times4$  arrays based on 3-D printing technology is fabricated and measured for demonstration. Each array is a subarray of 5  $\times5$  unit cells with the same parameters to facilitate processing. The measured results are in good agreement with the simulated ones.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3237362","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2141233,U2241229,62101416,62101515); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:CUC220B002,JG22145); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024930","Absorption;backscattering reduction;metasurface;optimized multielement phase cancellation (OMEPC);ultrawideband;water","Reflection;Metasurfaces;Scattering;Bandwidth;Ultra wideband technology;Absorption;Manganese","","7","","30","IEEE","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resolution threshold of the coincidence imaging system with multi-mode OAM is analyzed assisted by the subspace projection method. First, the relationship between the imaging resolution and the correlation function (CF) of the measurement mode is obtained based on the first-order correlation algorithm for the multi-mode OAM-based coincidence imaging (MM-OAMCI). Then, the feature vector of each imaging unit is extracted to distinguish the imaging point in the discretized imaging plane. Finally, the resolution threshold is given based on three factors, i.e., the feature vector, the noise, and the reconstruction algorithm. Specifically, the resolution of the MM-OAMCI system is determined by the deployment of the transmitting array, the reconstruction algorithm and the noise caused by the system design, the imaging modeling, and the environment noise. The super-resolution capability of the multi-mode OAM coincidence imaging system is validated by the simulations and experiments. The imaging results show that the resolutions in elevation and azimuth of the reconstructed image can be improved largely compared with the traditional microwave coincidence imaging (TMCI) methods, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3233718","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3902400); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071371); Foundation of National Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environment(grant numbers:202103014); Chinese Aeronautical Establishment(grant numbers:20182007002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10012579","Equivalent noise;feature vector;orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based coincidence imaging;super-resolution imaging","Imaging;Radar imaging;Image resolution;Correlation;Azimuth;Superresolution;Signal resolution","","11","","25","IEEE","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
