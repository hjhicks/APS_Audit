Symmetry properties of the antenna in terms of currents and the radiated fields are investigated. By means of numerical simulations, the antenna is analyzed in free space and on a semi-infinite substrate. It is shown that the maximum total efficiency and minimum input reflection coefficient occur around the second resonance frequency of the antenna. Depending on the relative permittivity of the semi-infinite substrate considered in this article (from 1 to 3.8), the maximum total efficiency of the proposed antenna ranges from 50.1% to 57.4% and its fractional bandwidth (BW) is between 85.2% and 96.6%. Fractional BW of loop antenna can be approximately twice that of graphene dipole antenna and maximum total efficiency can be about 14% higher. BW augmentation is explained using developed equivalent circuit models for dipole and loop antennas. It is also shown that under specific conditions, the radiation pattern of the proposed device can be approximated by an equivalent scheme of two coupled small electric dipole antennas. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed antenna tolerates moderate variations of graphene parameters.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3030991","Brazilian Agencies CAPES (Finance code 001) and CNPq; Federal University of Pará (UFPA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234059","Graphene;loop antenna;terahertz (THz) devices","Graphene;Dipole antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Time-domain analysis;Substrates;Finite difference methods","","17","","44","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The original strong coupling can be effectively suppressed by simply inserting a lumped inductance in between. To offer a systemic design guideline for this decoupling strategy, a mode cancellation method, based on the synthesis of common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM), is proposed. The inserted inductance plays a role of tuning CM and DM impedances to a similar status, which has an equivalent decoupling effect according to the theory of microwave network. Alternatively, the lumped inductance could also be replaced by an inductive connecting strip for a concise topology. To validate the proposed decoupling concept, a prototype is simulated, fabricated, and measured. The experimental results show that the poor isolation of 5 dB is improved to better than 15.4 dB across the entire matched bandwidth of 2.394-2.530 GHz, with an extremely close edge-to-edge distance of 0.016 λ0 and center-to-center distance of 0.44 λ0. Furthermore, the validation of extending to large-scale 1-D and 2-D arrays is also discussed.

Owing to the use of a novel Π-match and the utilization of coupling between the antenna end and feed point, both the real and imaginary parts of the input impedance of the proposed antenna can be tuned flexibly in a wide range. In addition, the input impedance varies smoothly with frequency, which implies a wide bandwidth.

While communication protocols in this field are subject to international regulations, there are plenty of opportunities to improve hardware realization of antenna devices that support this technology. In particular, readout range extension and miniaturization of passive RFID tags is an important challenge with far-reaching goals. Here, we introduce and analyze a new concept of high-permittivity ceramic tag that relies on different physical principles. Instead of using conduction currents in metallic wires to drive electronic chips and generate electromagnetic radiation, high-permittivity components rely on excitation of displacement currents. Those are efficiently converted to actual electric current which drives the memory chip. Practical aspects of this approach are improved robustness to environmental fluctuations, footprint reduction, and readout range extension. In particular, our high-permittivity ceramic ( ε ~ 100) elements have demonstrated a 25% reading range improvement in comparison to commercial tags. In case when state-of-the-art readers and RFID chips are used, the readout distances of the developed ceramic tags can reach 22 m. This number can be further extended with improved matching circuits.

Such a combination could not be easily realized by using conventional solid dielectrics due to fabrication and air-gap problems. An aperture-fed ME dipole for 4.1-5.3 GHz is firstly designed using a standard structure and a relatively small dimension. Then, a hybrid antenna is built by loading the ME-dipole with an aperture-fed cylindrical liquid DRA. Without increasing the antenna size and/or modifying the ME-dipole structure significantly, the hybrid antenna has realized a much wider bandwidth from 2.45 to 5.3 GHz after loading the liquid material. Moreover, it is found that the resonances of the ME-dipole are not simply shifted to lower frequencies after using the dielectric loading, it has strategically combined the multiple resonances of the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, DRA, and feeding slot. The mode combination principle and design guideline have been presented. As an example, a prototype of the proposed hybrid antenna has achieved a 73.5% fractional bandwidth with an electrical size of 0.66×0.66×0.16 λ03 at the center frequency (3.88 GHz), over 5 dBi (up to 7 dBi) broadside gain, total efficiency >80%, and beamwidth around 80°-120° across the frequency band. The proposed hybrid antenna has advantages in terms of wide bandwidth, smaller size, and simple structure compared with other ME-dipoles and traditional wideband antennas. The idea of this antenna design could be extended to other ME-dipole and DRA structures.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3037765","U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/P015751/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9263107","Complementary antennas;dielectric resonator antenna (DRA);hybrid antennas;liquid antennas;magneto-electric (ME) dipole antennas;wideband antennas","Dipole antennas;Loaded antennas;Bandwidth;Dielectric resonator antennas;Magnetic liquids;Antenna radiation patterns;Dielectrics","","36","","31","IEEE","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is based on a planar substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) dual-mode (TE102/TE201) cavity. When the vias on the edge become sparse, the electromagnetic wave leaks out while maintaining a good dual-mode filtering response. The antenna is folded in order to reduce the aperture size to form an un-splitted radiation beam with small side lobes. Owing to a rotated dual-mode operation, the fields escaping from four sets of sparse vias are approximately of equal amplitude with a progressive phase difference of 90° in sequence. CP radiation is thus achieved when the four orthogonal half-mode radiation patches are excited by the leaking field. By adopting a single feeding with two pairs of asymmetrical shorting pins, the peak gain is improved significantly and a 3 dB axial ratio (AR) response with two minima is obtained simultaneously. Long metal walls and rectangular slots are introduced to fold the current flow and change the wave direction. Consequently, sidelobe level is significantly reduced and the antenna directivity is enhanced. To verify this novel design idea, an antenna prototype with a height of 0.036λ0 has been fabricated using the multilayer PCB process and measured in a near-field microwave chamber. Measured results are well consistent with the simulation, demonstrating CP radiation with a flat/high gain and good filtering performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3037819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9263385","Circular polarization;filtering response;folded antenna;planar antenna;substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)","Antennas;Filtering;Substrates;Couplings;Band-pass filters;Metals;Bandwidth","","51","","34","IEEE","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key to the method is the application of a nonuniform radial TEM waveguide as opposed to the radially uniform TEM waveguide used in conventional RLSAs. Hence, the condition for maximum radiation is satisfied at a wide range of frequencies by different sections of the RLSA.

The beam scanning rate is a key consideration in some applications since it can minimize the bandwidth requirement of the system, during the scanning in broad angular regions. However, the sweeping linearity, namely the scanning angular range per unit frequency, is seldom considered at the same time in the published literature. In this article, we propose a waveguide-type LWA working from 11.1 to 12 GHz. By loading periodical pins with glide symmetry in the waveguide, it is possible to manipulate the dispersion properties of the fast wave mode, hereby giving rise to a good balance between the scanning rate and the sweeping linearity. This scenario has been validated by numerical simulation and experiment with excellent agreement. The measurement results reveal that the scanning angles have been increased to a range from 16.7°~67.5° varying the frequency from 11.1 to 12.1 GHz.

Effective biological camouflage strategies involve concealment under sunlight with multiple frequency (color) components, for example, a shark could fuse itself into sea water environment for better invisibility and hunting effectiveness. A wideband 3-D metasurface ground cloak in gigahertz frequency order is proposed and realized in the experiment with a hemispherical profile. A complex unit structure to broaden the operational frequency range for a phase-preserved electromagnetic metasurface based on the difference of elevation is also proposed. Comparison between the wideband and its contrast narrowband metasurface clearly indicates the scattering improvement effect that demonstrates the proposed metasurface’s significance. Both instantaneous electric field scanning and reflection cross section shrinking quantitatively give strong evidence of the wideband operational functions. Comparison between simulation and experiment validated each other. These results indicate that the proposed metasurface conceals itself into a background inside a wide frequency spectrum of 7.0–9.5 GHz. This structure has a great application value for object security under wave package illumination and in landscape fusion.

We propose a two-stage solution to this problem. First, we model reflection and transmission through rough slabs, such as doors, walls, and windows with the FDTD method. Our results indicate the influence of roughness and whether this influence is measurable, either reducing the magnitude of the reflected and transmitted waves or (most importantly) generating DS components. In the latter case, the surface effectively acts as a secondary source, whose pattern is computed by full-wave analysis. Then, this pattern is embedded in a ray tracer, enabling the computation and tracing of DS field components.

This article proposes novel 3-dimensional (3-D) printed discrete dielectric lenses (DDLs) for generation of nondiffractive OAM beams operating at 300 GHz. By virtue of its arbitrary aperture phase control capability, a terahertz (THz) DDL combining the functionalities of three conventional bulky refractive hyperbolic, spiral phase plane, and aixcon lenses is proposed to generate nondiffractive Bessel vortex beam carrying OAM. An aperture field analysis method is also developed to evaluate the radiation performance of the DDL antennas. Furthermore, to cover the OAM signal in an intended longitudinal region, two DDL synthesis methods are explored to generate extended higher order Bessel beams carrying OAM. The first approach is based on geometric optics, while the second uses the alternating projection method (APM) to optimize the aperture phase distribution of the DDL. Two THz DDLs are conveniently fabricated by 3-D printing technology. Measured results demonstrate that THz nondiffractive OAM beams can be successfully generated by the designed DDLs.

However, little attention has been paid to the uncertainty quantification of these deep-learning methods in solving ISPs. In other words, the error of the prediction is not known since the ground truth is not available in practice. In this article, a Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) is used to quantify the uncertainties in solving ISPs. With Monte Carlo dropout, the proposed BCNN is able to directly predict the pixel-based uncertainties of the widely used DLSs in ISPs. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of uncertainty predictions, both correlation coefficient and nonlinear correlation distribution between the predicted uncertainty and true absolute error are calculated. The tests on both synthetic and experimental data show that the predictive uncertainty is highly correlated with true absolute error calculated from the ground truth. Besides, when DLSs fail to solve an ISP, the predicted uncertainty increases significantly, which offers a pixel-based “confidence level” in solving ISPs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3030974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9233965","Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN);deep learning schemes (DLSs);inverse scattering problems (ISPs);uncertainty quantification","Uncertainty;Image reconstruction;Permittivity;Antennas;Convolutional neural networks;Training;Bayes methods","","64","","40","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In IoT networks, threats to hardware security are often not perceived as serious, with the assumption that an attack could only be carried out at close proximity. However, in this article, we show that through electromagnetic (EM) side-channel signal leakage, operational information and program activities of IoT devices and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) modules can be garnered from approximately 200 m away in an outdoor line-of-sight (LOS) environment. We describe an extensive measurement campaign conducted to investigate the aforementioned leakage and provide propagation models that can be used to predict the power (and corresponding variation i.e., shadowing gain) of the EM side-channel signal emanation at various distances, scenarios, and environments. With a circularly polarized receiver antenna, our results show that the received power of the emanated EM side-channel (carrier) signal varies from about -61 dBm at 1 m to about -112 dBm at 200 m in the outdoor LOS environment. Furthermore, a received signal power of about -73 dBm was observed at 1 m and -88 dBm was recorded at 10 m in an indoor LOS environment. Power variation (shadowing gain) of about 3.6 and 2.0 dB was observed in the outdoor and indoor environments, respectively.

By introducing resonant exciters, such as wire (electric currents), aperture (magnetic currents), or both, the antenna bandwidth can be improved. However, the contributing modes of apertures are not well recognized. A systematic framework is formulated for the characteristic mode analysis (CMA) and design of RMAs involving resonant apertures, by designing a low-profile wideband dual-polarized RMAs fed by slot arrays at 5 GHz Wi-Fi bands. Unlike regular microstrip patches, the aperture-backed MTS supports two fundamental TM03 modes of different symmetries. Even and odd symmetries are also observed for the aperture modes. By calculating the radiating power of individual mode, quantitative evidence is provided to clarify the operating principle of RMAs with resonant apertures that the bandwidth improvement and high-isolations are due to the modes from both the MTS and the aperture, rather than from individual. The overall size of the proposed antenna is λL ×λL ×0.058λL ( λL is the free-space wavelength at 4.8 GHz).

For lower band (LB1, 3.3-3.6 GHz) dipole, its inductive loadings are implemented at the end of each dipole arm to suppress the basic resonant mode for band rejection at higher frequencies. For higher band (HB2, 4.8-5.0 GHz) dipole, its LC loadings are implemented at the beginning of each dipole arm, where the inductor and the capacitor, respectively, increase the Q-factor for improving the out-of-band rejection and balance the impedance matching. Hence, LB1 and HB2 dipoles can be closely stacked with high isolation. Moreover, a dual-band artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) reflector is adopted for reducing the distance between the antenna and the ground plane. Consequently, the overall height of the proposed one is only 0.16 λL ( λL being the free-space wavelength at the center frequency of LB1), which is smaller than the previous dual-band stacked designs.

The RCS reduction is achieved in a much broader band than the operational band of the antenna. The simple technique is based on MS units on a grounded substrate in a checkerboard-like configuration. The broadband RCS reduction is achieved by combining two different destructive interference principles. In the high-frequency region, for a normal incident wave, the RCS is reduced by the phase cancellation generated by the MSs and the grounded substrate. In the low-frequency region, the RCS is reduced by the polarization conversion property of the MS. In this case, the fields reflected by two MS sections are in counter phase for a normal incident wave. The MS is combined with a CP patch antenna. It concerns a traditional corner-truncated square patch and four sequentially rotated surrounding MS cells. This dedicated MS allows two things: an additional resonant mode is excited resulting in a 3 dB AR bandwidth extension from 4.2% to 15.9% and a broadband RCS reduction of over 6 dB from 4.95 to 15.73 GHz (104.25% bandwidth) for both  $x$ - and  $y$ -polarized incident waves.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3030547","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201806290108); Science Research Project of Gansu Province Higher Educational Institutions(grant numbers:2019A-268); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229240","Broadband;circular polarization;gain enhancement;metasurface (MS);radar cross section (RCS)","Broadband antennas;Reflection;Patch antennas;Bandwidth;Broadband communication;Gain","","71","","24","IEEE","19 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the Roy-Shafai generalization of the Ludwig-3 polarization definition is in fact equivalent to the transformed Ludwig-2 definition. The Ludwig-3 polarization is that of a Huygens source, while the Ludwig-2 polarization definition corresponds to either an electric or, with transformation, a magnetic dipole. That the Roy-Shafai polarization definition is equivalent to a transformed Ludwig-2 definition is reasonable as the rectangular PEC-flanged aperture with an impressed electric field behaves as a magnetic dipole in the low frequency limit and, subject to some restrictions, maintains the same polarization pattern for all frequency assuming the aperture field remains uniform. Likewise, the rectangular PMC-flanged aperture with an impressed magnetic field behaves like an electric dipole in the low-frequency limit and maintains the same polarization pattern for all frequency again, assuming that the aperture field remains uniform and, thus, exhibits a Ludwig-2 polarization pattern.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3030551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229229","Copolarization;cross-polarization;Ludwig-3 definition;polarization;polarization pattern;projection","Electromagnetics;Magnetic levitation;Conductors;Aperture antennas;Polarization","","1","","10","IEEE","19 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Applying a novel approach through modification of the side aperture of HMSIW, we achieved an SLL of -13.8 and -11.2 dB in the upper hemisphere and full space, respectively. The key novelty of this communication is the reduction of SLL in full space while the state-of-the-art antennas only mitigated the SLL in the upper hemisphere. Furthermore, tapering the open side aperture in a thin trapezoid shape led to a significant reduction of beam squint. The operating frequency band of the antenna matches the allocated 5G wireless network millimeter-wave bands from 26 to 30 GHz. The measured peak realized gain of the antenna is 10.6 dBi at 28.5 GHz. The length, width, and height of the HMSIW antenna are 70, 15, and 0.5 mm, respectively. The antenna was fabricated on a Rogers RT/Duroid 5880 substrate. Excellent agreement between the measurements and simulated results was observed. The discrepancies between the measured and simulated results were analyzed by a complete and thorough sensitivity analysis that included the effects of the fabrication tolerances, connectors' misalignment, and bending due to the mechanical stress. High gain, low SLL, and compactness are among the advantages of the proposed antenna making it a suitable candidate for the miniaturization of 5G communication systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3037806","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9263342","Antenna;aperture;leaky-wave;side-lobe","Antennas;Antenna measurements;Antenna radiation patterns;Substrates;Gain;Aperture antennas;Electric fields","","19","","22","IEEE","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed slot presents wideband characteristics with a BW ratio of more than 4:1. The use of stepped-shape slot in a corrugated wall keeps the surface reactance capacitive over a relatively large frequency band. The H-plane sidewalls of the designed antenna are formed by curved pinwalls. The flare includes ridges to extend the frequency range, and the E-plane walls are corrugated with a wideband slot to improve the beamwidth constancy in elevation.

The periodic metallic structure plays the role of the EM switching for the mode selection of transmission/absorption by regulating the bias states of the loaded p-i-n diodes, while the corresponding amplitudes of the transmission/absorption can be further tuned by changing the effective sheet resistance of graphene through an electrostatic field bias. An equivalent circuit model is introduced to explain the EM switching and amplitude tuning behaviors of transmission/absorption. In addition, the designed AFSS is also demonstrated to perform well under circumstances of oblique incidence and different polarizations. The AFSS prototype is fabricated and measured. In the transmission mode, the transmission loss can be tuned from -4.8 to -1.1 dB at the band of 6-7 GHz, while in the absorption mode, the average value of absorptivity can be controlled between 0.65 and 0.95 at the band of 5-8.4 GHz.

Many PML implementations often use a smoothly increasing attenuation coefficient to increase the absorption for a given layer thickness, and, at the same time, to reduce the numerical reflection from the interface between the computation domain and the PML. In discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) methods, using a PML coefficient that varies within a mesh element requires a different mass matrix to be stored for every element and therefore significantly increases the memory footprint. In this work, this bottleneck is addressed by applying a weight-adjusted approximation to these mass matrices. The resulting DGTD scheme has the same advantages as the scheme that stores individual mass matrices, namely, higher accuracy (due to reduced numerical reflection) and increased meshing flexibility (since the PML does not have to be defined layer by layer), but it requires significantly less memory.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3037651","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR)(grant numbers:2019-CRG8-4056); KAUST Ali I.

AE-CFIE directly replaces the original CFIE on the sharp edges with EFIE. Using the dihedral angle of the meshes to describe the sharpness of the geometric structure, the hybrid criterion of EFIE/CFIE has been studied in detail. This strategy can be implemented conveniently under exiting basis functions and only a few lines of code need to be changed. Due to the inclusion of EFIE, AE-CFIE may sacrifice the convergence speed compared with CFIE. Therefore, we also investigate the performance of AE-CFIE with or without the preconditioner.

This work is focused on the control of the far-field radiated by SWs from a 3-D object. First, the standard problem of an infinite planar coating backed by an IBC is considered, the waves outside the coating satisfying the boundary condition at infinity. It is well known that the SWs wavenumbers are solutions of a transcendental equation that is obtained here via a very simple numerical method. Analytical results are presented for a lossless monolayer, some of which being, as far as we know, original. Then, from the known properties of the radiation operator, it is shown how these results can be used to control the far-field radiated by SWs on 3-D objects.
