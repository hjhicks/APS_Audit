Here, we demonstrate an atom-based receiver for AM and FM microwave communication with a 3 dB bandwidth in the baseband of ~100 kHz that provides optical circuit-free field pickup, multiband carrier capability, and inherently high field sensitivity. The atom-based receiver exploits field-sensitive cesium Rydberg vapors in a centimeter-sized glass cell, and electromagnetically induced transparency, a quantum-optical effect, as a readout of baseband signals modulated onto carriers with frequencies ranging over four octaves, from C-band to Q-band. Receiver bandwidth, dynamic range and sideband suppression are characterized, and acquisition of audio waveforms of human vocals demonstrated. The atomic receiver is a valuable receiver technology because it does not require antenna structures and is resilient against electromagnetic interference, while affording multiband operation in a single compact receiving element.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2987112","Rydberg Technologies Inc; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069423","Atomic antenna;atomic radio;atomic receiver;multiband;quantum;quantum technologies;radio communications;Rydberg atoms","Atomic measurements;Radio frequency;Frequency modulation;Baseband;Atom optics;Optical receivers","","132","","44","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna operates in 1.4 GHz Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS) band and 2.45 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band under proper feeding scheme. The lower band with quarter-wavelength resonance is realized by introducing two shorting pins to orthogonal strips. As a disturbance between two arc-shaped tails with open end is introduced, it can achieve circular polarization (CP) radiation property. Meanwhile, the higher band with half-wavelength resonance is realized through the path connecting two asymmetric open-end tails, so as to achieve linear polarization (LP) radiation property.

Two different implementations of the multilayer are proposed, labeled as Cases A and B. As to Case A, a high-permittivity layer is embedded between two slabs of low permittivity, whereas a single layer of low permittivity, surrounded by two high-permittivity slabs, is employed in Case B. Successful performances of the broadband behavior are also dependent on the side length of the EBG, that is truncated to small footprints, with an effect of high sidelobe level (SLL). Therefore, grid layouts with nonuniform air holes are proposed for in-plane realization of the dielectric slabs. Their effect in the EBG superstrate is a nonuniform spatial reflectivity, that reduces the SLL keeping a good wideband response. In the EBG manufacturing, both numerically controlled machining techniques and 3-D printing have been employed. 3-D printing has been used for the low permittivity layers, realized in the polylactic acid (PLA) filament, allowing more flexibility in the fabrication of the grid slabs to custom layouts.

This produces a perturbation of the surface wave, resulting in the generation of a directional leaky wave over the aperture, whose complex propagation constant is described by a single fast backward spatial harmonic. The antenna radiation features are numerically investigated in conjunction with the dispersion analysis of the structure, validated through a conventional generalized-pencil-of-function approach.

The proposed structure is demonstrated to show improved WPT efficiency under different forms of misalignment between the transmitting and receiving antennas by the virtue of miniaturization and the fringing fields. Specifically, a central bar structure is added in the traditional loop antenna to provide dipole-like and miniaturized performance. Concurrently, a discontinuity in the loop is introduced to enable fringing fields beyond the aperture of the antenna. Investigations are conducted to conclude that a superiority in the performance is associated with these fringing fields. Design-optimization, simulation, and measurement investigations are conducted to estimate the WPT performance under various forms of misalignment.

The rectenna is based on a compact inductively matched rectifier. The textile-based rectifier occupies 0.22 cm2 and achieves a state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 41.8% at -20 dBm, at 820 MHz, despite its lossy substrate.

Time-varying S-parameters are used to quantify the impact of the capacitor's charge on the impedance matching. The rectifier directly charges a 1.32 mF capacitor up to 1 V in 0.41 and 4.5 s from 10 and 0 dBm, respectively.

The antenna consists of a cross slot antenna (CSA), a pair of vertical and horizontal metal plates, two side walls, and a cavity reflector, fed by a simple single feeding structure. In the lower frequency band, a loop antenna operating in 1λ mode is formed by the ground of the CSA, a pair of horizontal plates, and two side walls, to generate the LP radiation. In the higher frequency band, the cross slot works as a magnetic dipole (M-dipole), while the horizontal plates work as an electric dipole (E-dipole).

The proposed antenna is achieved by combining an NFF ridged-waveguide slot array with a double-layer folded focused progressive feeding network. The linear ridged-waveguide slot array antenna is designed with a height-modulated ridge to focus on the power in one direction. The folded feeding line with different length is used to generate the desired focused phase and frequency-dependent progressive phase shift in the other direction. In this case, as the working frequency is swept in the considered range, the inherent frequency-dependent behavior of the linear NFF leaky-wave antenna (LWA) allows a single-scanning sweep in one direction, whereas the focused progressive feeding network ensures multiple-scanning sweeps in the other direction. A full 2-D electronic scanning with no coverage blindness in the scanning area is achieved. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed NFF antenna array is the first design to achieve the full 2-D scanning focus in the near-field (NF) region only by sweeping the frequency, which means that the testing information in the NF region can be directly obtained with a certain band of frequency.

Inspired by this observation, the SPARC algorithm is presented to achieve quiescent pattern control. In contrast to other array response control-based pattern synthesis techniques, the SPARC algorithm obtains a deterministic expression of the complex factor after maximizing the magnitude response at the main-beam direction, and the closed-form expression of the designed weight vector is devised. Because of different pattern constraints in focused and shaped beampatterns, two low-complexity pattern synthesis schemes are presented employing the SPARC algorithm in an iterative manner. Moreover, the parameter selection principle of the SPARC and its comparison with other pattern synthesis methods are discussed.

Novel equivalent circuit (EC) formulas are proposed after full-wave simulation and parameter fitting. Furthermore, with substrate, another two variables, the effective permittivity for inductance and capacitance, are introduced with detailed calculation equations. The results obtained by simulation and EC calculation show that not only the resonance frequencies but also the frequency responses over a wide frequency band are found to be in reasonable agreement, when the wavelength of the operating frequency is smaller than the period. For verification of complex structures and actual application, two absorbers based on cross dipole and square loop FSSs, respectively, are proposed. Good agreement is gained between the measurements of a fabricated sample working from 2.03 to 9.36 GHz, and the results obtained by EC calculation and simulation. The results verify that it is feasible to use this method in the study of more complex and novel structures which are based on resonant FSSs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3027514","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61731005); Preresearch Foundation of National Defense(grant numbers:170441413086,614240205070817); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2016Z008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212556","Equivalent circuit (EC);frequency selective surface (FSS);measurement;microwave absorber","Frequency selective surfaces;Strips;Resonant frequency;Substrates;Current distribution;Mathematical model;Integrated circuit modeling","","17","","19","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A two-axis symmetric structure helps to provide a stable frequency response for incident waves with different polarization angles up to 60°. Capacitive loading further reduces the unit size and extends the maximum stable incident angle. The working mechanism of the design has been explained through an equivalent lumped element circuit model (ECM), which provides a generic approach to retune or optimize the design for another frequency band.

The transient scattering from rough surface was rarely studied, especially for the layered rough surface. When the target is above the rough surface, it needs to solve the composite transient scattering from the rough surface and the target above it. In this article, we mainly focus on the time-domain (TD) analysis for transient scattering from the target and layered rough surface based on time-domain ray tracing (TDRT) modeling. Applying geometrical optics (GO), the multiple bounces of the transient EM waves between layered rough surfaces and target are traced to obtain the incident field of the irradiated surfaces. Then considering the particularity of the layered rough surface, we modify TD Gordon integral and reduce the TD physical optics (TDPO) integral to closed-form expressions to improve the computing efficiency. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm, the transient scattering simulations of the composite model involving target and layered rough surface are compared with frequency-domain ray tracing (FDRT) with inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), as well as the results obtained by the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) of FEKO in conjunction with IFFT (IFFT-MLFMA).

Compared to previous approaches, the proposed MIW exhibits 63 dB lower loss, translating conventional power levels of mW down to μW or nW. In this work, we introduce the operating principle of MIW WBAN through underlying theory and dispersion diagrams. The proof-of-concept numerical and experimental results are reported for frequency bands centered around 40.4 and 80.7 MHz for a cylindrical human limb and are found to be in excellent agreement. Design guidelines are extensively discussed to accommodate several possible scenarios (frequency selection, gap between the loops, number of loops, and loop radius) along with practical considerations including loop tilts, anatomical limbs, limb movements, unequal loop gaps, and loop failure. Specific absorption rate (SAR) calculations confirm that this technology is highly safe for human use.

It is shown that the arrangement of the resonators in the chipless tag plays a crucial role in determining the cross-polar RCS of the tag. The RCS of the tag is computed theoretically by using array theory where each resonator is treated as a separate scatterer completely characterized by a specific reflection coefficient. Several resonators arrangements (periodic and nonperiodic) are compared, keeping the physical area of the tag fixed.

"A Hierarchical Bayesian Inversion Method for Electromagnetic Imaging of Inhomogeneous Objects With Piecewise Homogeneities","F. -F. Wang; Q. H.

In addition to being nonlinear, inverse scattering problems are also ill-posed which can be overcome through a regularization scheme by taking into account some kind of a priori information. However, it is not straightforward to incorporate such inhomogeneity prior information into conventional inversion methods. In this work, we propose an innovative method to solve the problem of imaging inhomogeneous objects with piecewise homogeneity. Under Born approximation (BA), this problem is cast into a linear inversion one which is then addressed by means of a hierarchical Bayesian inversion method. To account for the piecewise homogeneity of the image, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is developed to enforce the feature. Specifically, a hidden label variable which is associated with each pixel is introduced for the class of materials and the contrast of each pixel is modeled as a mixture of independent Gaussian priors. Then, the proposed hierarchical Bayesian inversion method incorporates the GMM to the variational Bayesian inference framework to approximate the posterior distribution of all the unknowns (the unknown contrast, hidden label variable, and other model parameters). In addition, the damped generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) is utilized to circumvent the matrix inversion, making the overall process very computationally efficient. Extensive numerical examples will be shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3028212","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601245,61601242); Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves(grant numbers:K201724); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2016M601693); Foundation of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:NY214047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216606","Bayesian inference;Born approximation (BA);electromagnetic inverse scattering problem;Gaussian mixture model (GMM)","Bayes methods;Inverse problems;Nonhomogeneous media;Scattering;Imaging;Iterative methods;Electromagnetics","","5","","39","IEEE","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The PLWA is made of a new type of periodically arranging meander line structures, in which the capacitive coupling between neighboring units plays the key role in achieving a high scanning rate. In detail, the beam-scanning rate of the proposed PLWA is efficiently tuned by varying the gap between two adjacent units, without considerably changing the working frequency band. To mitigate the open stopband (OSB) and to improve the impedance matching, several inductive open stubs are introduced into a single meander line unit cell to enhance the radiation. In the experiment, a prototype of the proposed PLWA was fabricated and measured. The simulated and measured beams show good agreement in terms of scanning range and radiation performance. A continuous beam scanning from −60° to +58° through broadside in the frequency band of 5.95–7.1 GHz is observed, and hence, a 102.6°/GHz scanning rate is realized in practice. Besides, the PLWA shows an average gain level of 11.96 dBi with a variation lower than 2 dB and a sidelobe below −10 dB at all the measured frequencies. The proposed PLWA may have potential applications in radar, microwave imaging, and wireless communication due to its compact structure, easy to fabricate, and dispersionless performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3029721","Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LY19F010012); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971174,61875051); UTS FEIT Blue Sky Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9224133","Broadside radiation;consistent gain;continuous beam scanning;leaky-wave antenna (LWA);open stopband (OSB)","Microstrip;Microstrip antennas;Gain;Dispersion;Impedance matching;Radar imaging","","55","","29","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a novel, endfire, dual-port antenna element with dual functionalities of radiator and power splitter is designed. The element is composed of a substrate integrated cavity (SIC) and a dipole based on it. The resonant frequencies of the SIC and dipole can be independently tuned to broaden the impedance bandwidth. Based on this dual-port element, a four-element subarray can be easily constructed without resorting to a complicated feeding network. The endfire subarray features broad beamwidth of over 180°, high isolation, and low profile, rendering it suitable for wide-angle beam-scanning applications in the H-plane. In addition, the methods of steering the radiation pattern downward or upward in the E-plane are investigated. As a proof of concept, two phased array antennas each consisting of eight subarrays are designed and fabricated to achieve the broadside and wide-angle beam-scanning radiation. Thanks to the elimination of surface wave, the mutual coupling between the subarrays can be reduced for improving the scanning angle while suppressing the sidelobe level.

Consequently, the resonance frequency of MSA can be decreased due to introducing those interdigital-like capacitances, while obvious miniaturization can be realized accordingly. By optimizing the parameters of the sawtooth radiating slots, a miniaturized antenna using cross-shaped interembedded MS is proposed, achieving an impedance bandwidth of 35.08% and a high gain of about 8.25 dBi with a compact overall size of 0.66λ0 ×0.66λ0.

We begin by deriving deflection conditions such that the discrete scatterers of the refractor need to have linear dispersion curves in the operating frequency band. The rich dispersion properties of the SSPP make it a good candidate for meeting the broadband deflection condition. Next, we design symmetric metallic blade structures (MBSs) to efficiently transform free-space waves into SSPPs and to realize the broadband linear dispersion relationship. The BAR is comprised of these MBSs with different strip heights. A prototype is designed, fabricated, and measured. Both the simulated and experimental results demonstrate excellent fixed-direction deflection in the 6.9-9.1 GHz band for the normal incidence case. Furthermore, the BAR still performs well when its outer profile is deformed to some extent, which is desirable in practical applications.
