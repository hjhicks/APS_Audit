"A Heuristic Study of the Bandwidth Potential of Electrically Small, Platform-Based Antennas at the HF Band",A. Bouvy; N. Behdad,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI, USA",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,2 Feb 2021,2021,69,2,623,635,"In this article, two primary bandwidth considerations for electrically small, platform-based antennas in the high-frequency (HF) band were analyzed: coupling element (CE) location and CE design. First, we analyzed an all-metallic cuboid platform with dimensions of 3.20 × 2.76 × 7.54 m3 at 5 MHz. At this frequency, the isolated platform has one dominant characteristic mode. In this analysis, a variety of electrically small CE designs, each occupying a fixed hemispherical volume with a radius of 0.5 m, were considered. The bandwidth potential of each element was examined when mounted at different locations on the platform. This analysis was then extended to a more complex platform: the U.S. Marine Corps Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV). The CE type and placement were found to have a significant impact on the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. For both the cuboid and the AAV, the highest bandwidth was obtained when a capacitive CE, the spherical-cap monopole, was mounted at the corners of the platform. Though one mode is dominant, contributions of higher-order modes play a significant role in the obtained bandwidth. A scaled model of the cuboid platform and the spherical-cap monopole were fabricated and experimentally characterized. Measurement results were found to be in good agreement with simulations.",1558-2221,,10.1109/TAP.2020.3016405,"Office of Naval Research under ONR(grant numbers:N00014-16-1-2098); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9171506,Antenna theory;antennas;characteristic mode (CM) analysis;communication systems;electrically small antennas (ESAs);electromagnetic (EM) analysis;military communication;mobile antennas,Bandwidth;Couplings;Electric potential;Current distribution;Ice;Antenna theory,,5,,39,IEEE,19 Aug 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The proposed antenna is composed of the radiator, excitation units, and feeding network. A square conductive slab (SCS) is used as the main radiator, which is designed elaborately by characteristic mode analysis (CMA). Different modes of the radiator are stimulated selectively by four groups of balanced inductive exciters (BIEs) to realize horizontal polarization (HP), vertical polarization (VP), left-hand circular polarization (LHCP), and right-hand circular polarization (RHCP). Two p-i-n diodes are embedded into the feeding network to switch the excitation states of the four groups of BIEs, thereby achieving quad-polarization reconfiguration. More importantly, a novel method exploiting the CMA is adopted for achieving low cross polarization. By means of introducing the orthogonal mode, the cross-polarization component of the fundamental mode can be canceled out by the co-polarization component of the orthogonal mode, which greatly reduces the cross polarization from -10 to -40 dB in the two principal planes. The measurement results demonstrate that the quad-polarization agility and a cross-polarization level around -30 dB under all polarization states are achieved simultaneously, verifying the functionality and reliability of the proposed method.",1558-2221,,10.1109/TAP.2020.3016384,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801299); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515011037); Mobility Program for Taiwan Young Scientists(grant numbers:RW2019TW001); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:GJHZ20180418190529516,JSGG20180507183215520); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9171483,Characteristic mode theory (CMT);low cross polarization;polarization reconfigurable antenna,Antenna radiation patterns;Polarization;Antenna feeds;Antenna theory;Dipole antennas;Current distribution,,42,,38,IEEE,19 Aug 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Nevertheless, to maintain resonance at 2.45 GHz with body-loading scenarios, a high separation was required, leading to an overall large size. To circumvent that, an all-textile 2 × 2 artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) array was placed in-between the antenna and the human body. In free space, the low-profile integrated design exhibited a gain of 7.63 dBi (enhancement of 5.29 dBi) and total efficiency of 96.4%. The integrated design achieved a gain and total efficiency enhancements by 14.88 dBi and 72.4%, respectively, as well as, lower specific absorption rate (SAR) levels, in comparison with the CRLH antenna alone, for human loading cases. Results are achieved through circuit model and full-wave electromagnetic simulations. In addition, the CRLH antenna and AMC array structure were fabricated and measurements were undertaken, which agreed well with the simulated ones.

For two closely spaced antennas, the mutual coupling effect can be analyzed and solved by exciting them simultaneously with in-phase (CM) and out-of-phase (DM) signals. It is theoretically proved that, if CM and DM impedances are the same, the mutual coupling effect between two separated antennas can be totally eliminated. Therefore, we can solve the coupling problem by CM and DM impedance analysis and exploit the unique field properties of characteristic modes to assist in antenna decoupling in a physical intuitive way. To validate the feasibility of this method, two practical design examples, including the decoupling between closely spaced dipole antennas and planar inverted-F antennas, are proposed. Both design examples have demonstrated that the proposed method can provide a systemic design guideline for antenna decoupling and achieve better decoupling performance compared to the conventional decoupling techniques.

Two orthogonal slots are etched out in the middle of a square patch. As a result, radiation patterns of original TM12/21 modes are reshaped to the desired ones that are similar to those of TM10/01 modes, leading to significant enhancement of broadside radiation. To accommodate the modified current distributions of the two operating modes, a pair of perturbed stubs is proposed and then loaded on the slot-loaded patch, which leads to the quadrature-phase difference. In order to suppress unwanted modes that tilt the radiation pattern away from broadside direction, differential-fed configuration instead of single-fed one is adopted to excite modified TM12/21 modes. Characteristic modes theory (CMT) is used to analyze the input impedance of differential-fed patch antenna and determine the two feeding positions. Next, the proposed antenna is compared with three conventional ones, which reveals its superiority in the highest directivity. Besides, it is also discussed how to determine the size of the finite ground plane.

However, the focus of this article is on the size minimization of the dome as required for applications where the form factor is critical. Therefore, a lower boundary of the height of the dome is derived and imposed as a design constraint. The antenna is analyzed using in-house ray tracing and physical optics software tools. It is shown that, when the array is combined with the dielectric dome, a significant directivity enhancement can be achieved for wide scanning.

The introducing of contraction operator can ensure that the discretized IE will be iteratively convergent in large conductivity contrast between abnormal bodies and background medium. Moreover, the contraction operator can also accelerate the iteration convergence of the IE. During the discretization process of CIE, direct waves are extracted from dyadic Green's functions (DGFs) of multilayered medium, and the singular integrals of direct waves are eliminated using equivalent sphere and ellipsoid methods. By splitting DGF into convolution terms and correlation terms, 3-D FFT can be used to accelerate the product evaluation of DGFs integral and scattering current encountered in each iteration.

First, the flow field of the plasma sheath is divided into nonuniform calculation subregions with different spacing sizes. The shape of the external flow field of the aircraft is modeled by fitting with a paraboloid and circular platform with different radii. Then, the electron density, temperature, and pressure distribution are obtained by collecting data from different points in the flow field of the sheath. Finally, a piecewise PO method is used to calculate the backscattering radar cross section (BRCS) of the hypersonic vehicle covered with plasma sheath from  $L$ -band to  $X$ -band.

First, the RadioMetOP model accuracy is tested by comparing the signal-to-noise ratio, measured during the transmission periods, with the simulated one, properly scaled to the symbol rate operated by HB2, finding correlation values of 0.9 that confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Second, the a posteriori analysis of the optimization process is accomplished, showing that depending on the considered criteria for the link-budget optimization, the use of the RadioMetOP model would have allowed a transmitted data volume more than doubled and an average signal-to-noise ratio gain between 2.1 and 3.8 dB.",1558-2221,,10.1109/TAP.2020.3016865,"Sapienza University of Rome; European Space Agency through the project “Weather Forecast and Ka-Band Link Analysis With Hayabusa-2 Cross-Support Data” under the ESOC Contract RadioMetOP-HB2.SUR.01/19; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172107,Deep-space link optimization;Ka-band radiopropagation;stochastic weather forecast,Atmospheric modeling;Predictive models;Radiometry;Signal to noise ratio;Stochastic processes;Weather forecasting,,17,,21,IEEE,20 Aug 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

They are often transformed into optimization problems and solved by deterministic or stochastic algorithms. In this article, an inversion method combining a customized particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is proposed. Stochastic algorithms tackle optimization problems in a global manner, which is an important feature in reducing the risk of optimization falling into local extrema. Another feature utilized here is that constraints can be easily applied in the optimization process, yielding better results. Based on this consideration, a customized PSO algorithm incorporating the mutation operator is proposed to further enrich the swarm diversity. However, the large-scale search in the solution space also increases the computational burden, which is the major limitation of stochastic algorithms being applied in microwave imaging problems. In this article, a novel cost function of inversion optimization problems is derived based on the Born approximation so that the evaluation of individual fitness can be performed by the FFT.

Due to safety and imaging quality reasons each individual channel of the array should be decoupled-electromagnetically isolated from the others. The required number of channels is large and in some techniques the dipole antennas should be located in the close proximity of the human body. Their ultimately dense arrangement leads to a strong mutual coupling and makes the conventional decoupling structures inefficient. This coupling needs to be suppressed without a significant distortion of RF fields in the imaged area. In this work, we propose and study a novel decoupling technique for two UHF transceiver on-body dipole antennas. The decoupling is performed by a periodic structure of five parallel resonant wires referred to as a metasurface (MS). In contrast to conventional decoupling with a single resonant wire, the MS decoupled by means of excitation of a higher order coupled mode of the wires, which field is highly confined.

Taking the diagnosis of receiving paths as an example, its principle is as follows. Periodic phase modulations with different frequencies are added to each phase shifter of the phased array. Because of the periodic modulation, harmonic components are generated in all the elements. As modulation frequencies added to all the elements are different from each other, the generated harmonic components have different frequencies correspondingly. If some elements suffer failure, the corresponding harmonic components will vanish from the output of the power combiner. Therefore, the faulty elements can be located by analyzing the spectrum of the received signal after the power combiner. The proposed method needs no the auxiliary hardware and its signal processing is concise.

This work proposes a novel 1 bit transmitarray element design at Ku-band, which adopts the receiver-transmitter structure with an active receiving dipole and a passive asymmetric transmitting dipole. The 1 bit phase shift is achieved by alternating two p-i-n diodes integrated on the active dipole to reverse its current direction. To mitigate the influence of p-i-n diodes and reduce the element insertion loss, a parasitic bypass dipole is added next to each dipole. Element simulations show that a low loss of only 1.0 dB is achieved. The dual-linear polarization capability is obtained by orthogonally interlacing two sets of proposed receiver-transmitter structures. A 100-element transmitarray prototype is designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured gain is 18.3 dB at 12.2 GHz, corresponding to an aperture efficiency of 22.6%.

Thanks to the MTM antenna possessing periodical configuration with isolated units, p-i-n diodes in each unit are capable of being actuated individually with OFF/ON-states (coding sequences 0/1), equivalently tuning the phase constant β of each cell either in state β0 or state β1. Therefore, for MTM array with a certain number of units, we can obtain plenty of tunable states presented via digitally coding sequence combinations, thereby manipulating beam scanning in a fixed frequency band.

The proposed scheme spatially expands the current using high-order nodal functions defined on curvilinear triangles discretizing the scatterer surface. Applying Nyström discretization, which uses this expansion, to the TD-MFIE, which is written as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) by separating self-term contribution, yields a system of ODEs in unknown time-dependent expansion coefficients. A predictor-corrector method is used to integrate this system for the samples of these coefficients. Since the Gram matrix arising from the Nyström discretization is a block-diagonal, the resulting MOT scheme replaces the matrix “inversion” required at each time step by a product of the inverse block-diagonal Gram matrix and the right-hand side vector. It is shown that, on the convergence of the corrector updates, this explicit MOT scheme produces the same solution as its implicit counterpart and is faster for large time step sizes.",1558-2221,,10.1109/TAP.2020.3010997,"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR)(grant numbers:2016-CRG5-2953); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149799,Magnetic field integral equation (MFIE);marching-on-in-time (MOT);Nyström method;predictor–corrector scheme,Integral equations;Interpolation;Convergence;Time-domain analysis;Magnetic domains;Magnetic separation;STEM,,10,,29,CCBY,27 Jul 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
