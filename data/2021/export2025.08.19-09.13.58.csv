The decoupling can be simply realized by adding a pure dielectric block (DB) above the coupled array. By means of DB to modify the space permittivity (propagation constant), the space-wave coupling can be controlled to cancel surface-wave coupling for isolation enhancement. Five benchmarks of combinations of two patch antennas with different positions or orientations are investigated to validate the decoupling concept and elaborate on the design procedure. The results show that the proposed method could provide over 20 dB isolation enhancements for patch antennas with 0.1λ0 or 0.027λ0 separation distances. Besides, wide isolation bandwidths and good radiation performances can be achieved for the DB-loaded antennas without reduction in total efficiency, front-to-back ratio (FBR), boresight gain, or polarization purity. Notably, the DB can be designed independently of the original array, making this method potential for some previously fabricated arrays without requiring modifying or replacing them with new ones.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3026897","Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:GRF 17209918); Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development(grant numbers:FA2386-17-1-0010); NSFC(grant numbers:61271158); HKU Seed Fund(grant numbers:201711159228); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210811","Decoupling;dielectric block (DB);isolation;multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO);mutual coupling;patch array;space wave;surface wave","Couplings;Surface waves;Substrates;Surface impedance;Patch antennas;MIMO communication","","60","","45","IEEE","1 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For modulations with constant period, the mismatch between the SW wavelength and the period imposes a limitation on the gain-bandwidth product. However, this limitation can be overcome by shaping the local period as a function of the radial distance. Doing so, we generate an annular active region on the antenna aperture, where the SW-to-impedance interaction mainly occurs. Such active region moves from the antenna center to the circular rim as the frequency decreases. This article shows that one can optimize the profile of the local periodicity function to obtain broadside pencil beams over large bandwidths, while preserving the flatness of the gain versus frequency response and a good stability of the phase center. The antenna performances so obtained are really unique for flat antennas based on printed technology. Finally, we present a simple formula for the product between average gain and bandwidth, which gradually blends into the already known expression for modulations with constant period. This formula establishes an absolute limit of the gain-bandwidth product, which only depends on the wavelength-normalized antenna radius at the central frequency.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3026476","Région Bretagne under the Stratégie d’Attractivité Durable (SAD) volet 2 programme(grant numbers:SAD17012); European Union through the European Regional Development Fund; French Region of Brittany, Ministry of Higher Education and Research, Rennes Métropole, and Conseil Départemental 35 through the CPER Project STIC and Ondes; Project of Relevant Italian Interest (PRIN) “Metasurface Antennas for Space.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210226","Broadband antennas;circular polarization;impedance boundary conditions (IBCs);leaky waves (LWs);metasurface (MTS) antennas;surface waves (SWs)","Apertures;Bandwidth;Gain;Modulation;Broadband antennas;Broadband communication","","24","","25","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hybrid radar system consists of a vertically distributed phased transmitting array (PTA) and a horizontally aligned digital beamforming (DBF) receiving array, thereby enabling 2-D beam scanning with a reduced channel number. In contrast to time-division multiplexing (TDM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars, in which only a single transmitter is active at a time in the TDM MIMO radar configuration due to the working principle of switching between different transmitting elements, here, all the phased array transmitters of the proposed radar work simultaneously. The demonstrated system realizes a higher transmitted power and signal-to-noise ratio, provided that the equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) is not limited and the radiated power of each transmitter is equal in these two radar configurations. In addition, only 1-D DBF is required for the proposed hybrid radar because beamforming in another dimension is accomplished by the PTA, thus alleviating the baseband complexity and signal processing burden. As a proof-of-concept example for system validation, a hybrid radar prototype is fabricated and measured at around 24 GHz, without considering any specific EIRP limitations in this band, thus confirming the validity of the proposed concept.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044368","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61627801); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0101000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9298908","Digital beamforming (DBF);phased transmitting array (PTA);radar system","Radar;Phased arrays;Radar antennas;MIMO radar;Array signal processing;Time division multiplexing;Baseband","","24","","33","IEEE","18 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This enables to solve the discrete optimization problem of finding the defective elements in antenna arrays. Instead of considering the conventionally used single pattern, the degraded dual-beam patterns of TMA are utilized to enhance the convergence speed in detecting the faulty elements. Finally, a phasor matrix that stores the phasor components of the array factor is defined for the fast computation of error-free and failed array factors.

By dividing a single-large-aperture lens into N small-aperture lens elements with the focus-to-diameter ratio of a lens antenna unchanged, the overall thickness of the proposed antenna is reduced by N times. The beamsteering is achieved in two steps. First, the main beam direction of MLA antenna is switched over a large angular step by shifting the feeding antennas beneath each lens element. Then, the switched beams are fine steered by a low-cost N-element phased array. Theoretical analysis using array theory is performed to work out a general design method with discussion on the taper and spillover effect of feed-power pattern on the lens array. Based on the proposed method, a three-lens linear MLA fed by a phased array is designed to operate at 10 GHz. The proposed antenna achieves a 3 dB beamwidth coverage range of ±30° with a beam crossing level higher than -3 dB and a gain tolerance of 1.6 dB with a maximum gain of 19.1 dBi. The presented antenna can be used to achieve volumetric beamsteering performance directly.

Then, to deal with the nonconvexity in the wide beam (WB) directivity maximization problem, a novel iterative directivity optimization method based on Taylor expansion of the quadratic function is proposed, and the original nonconvex problem can be efficiently solved by the convex optimization methods in an iterative way.

First, we propose a new taper efficiency coefficient, which allows us to assess the effect of tapering on EIRP (in contrast to the standard taper efficiency that describes the effect of tapering on gain only). Then, we present an optimization method to compute the taper weights that maximize the defined efficiency for an assumed bound on the sidelobe level. The obtained optimal weights can be used not only to taper an antenna array but also as a benchmark for other tapers. Therefore, we analyze several known tapers and compare their transmit efficiencies. As a result, we find that for some combinations of sidelobe level and array length, the proposed optimal taper provides substantially better efficiency than Dolph–Chebyshev or Taylor tapers.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3028225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216516","Active array;equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP);taper efficiency","Optimization;Radar antennas;Planar arrays;Linear programming;Transmitting antennas;Radar","","5","","26","IEEE","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The intent of this work is to validate the embedded element performance of the dual-polarized triangular-lattice Vivaldi, comparing one-to-one with results for a similarly sized dual-polarized all-metal Vivaldi array on a square (egg-crate) lattice, reported previously. The triangular-lattice Vivaldi array is optimally sampled for grating-lobe-free scans with a potential 15.5% reduction in element count compared to a corresponding optimally sampled square-lattice array of similar size. As such, the footprint of the manufactured triangular-lattice Vivaldi array is roughly 8% larger than the square-lattice array, yet has 7% fewer elements. Infinite array predictions are presented and shown to compare favorably with previous findings for the square-lattice Vivaldi array, noting minor performance compromises.

Two additional constraints should also be fulfilled: 1) avoid aliasing in the frequency domain; the modulation frequency should be larger than the transmitted signal's bandwidth and 2) accurately extract harmonics; the bandpass filter (BPF) bandwidth should be no less than the modulation frequency. If the bandwidth of the transmitted signal increases, the processor and radio frequency (RF) switch should be accordingly improved, thus increasing the overall costs. In this article, we propose a method based on partition subarrays for TMPA harmonic beamforming. Upon modulating subarrays separately and simultaneously, we obtain an equivalent beam. In our scheme, a TMPA is divided into S subarrays, such that the modulation frequency and the maximum bandwidth of the transmitted signal can be S times the original ones, making filtering much easier. Our approach has three major advantages: 1) it greatly reduces the requirement of BPF by enlarging the frequency interval; 2) it allows the transmission of larger bandwidth signals with the same hardware; and 3) the efficiency of the antenna is improved.

Initially, a basic resonator of a square patch with diagonal corner truncations is theoretically investigated so as to demonstrate that two orthogonal modes can be simultaneously excited in a single patch resonator. Then, to eliminate the cross-polarized reflection caused by the orthogonal modes, a composite resonator, including four of such corner-truncated patches with 90° rotation between each two adjacent patches, is constructed and analyzed. Furthermore, by arranging two of such composite resonators in a back-to-back manner through coupling apertures on the middle metallic layer, an FSS element of three-layer AC-DMPR is formed. Compared with traditional aperture-coupled patch resonators (AC-PRs), the resonant modes of AC-DMPR are increased twice, thus giving more design flexibility to achieve high-order performance. To validate the design concept, a single-band fourth-order bandpass FSS is designed by introducing magnetic couplings in the AC-DMPRs. Moreover, dual-band second-order bandpass FSSs with magnetic and/or electric couplings in the AC-DMPRs are also designed. Based on the even- and odd-mode analysis method, equivalent circuit models are established to explain the operating principles of the proposed structures. Finally, the designed FSSs are fabricated and measured.

Instead of calculating induced currents directly from a matrix inversion, a forward-induced current learning method (FICLM) is introduced to calculate the induced current through a neural-network mapping. The scattered fields can be further calculated through a multiplication of the Green's function with the predicted induced currents. Inspired by wave physics of scattering problems, we have designed three kinds of input schemes, covering different combinations of the given incident field and permittivity contrast, to evaluate the performance of the FICLM model under both single-incidence and multi-incidence cases. Numerical results prove that the proposed FICLM outperforms the method of moments (MoM) in terms of both computational speed and accuracy by use of reference data with a higher precision. The FICLM with the direct sum of permittivity contrast and a so-called Born-type induced current, achieves the best calculation accuracy and generalization capability compared to the other two inputs. The comparison with other types of neural networks, such as U-net, also demonstrates the superior performance of FICLM for dealing with complex scatterers due to the use of adversarial framework in pix2pix.

Then, an automatic iteration load balancing scheme has been employed to optimize the positions of the interfaces in order to minimize the CPU time differences between subdomains with the help of the diagram obtained in the first step. This scheme comes with a one-click solution using a greedy algorithm after an initial division of the original model, which is the only step that requires an external operation.

The main advantage of the present method is that it permits the scatterer to have continuously varying highly inhomogeneous gyrotropic characteristics, i.e., the constitutive parameters of the cylinder can be highly inhomogeneous in both gyroelectric and gyromagnetic tensors. Initially, the 2-D Green's function (GF) is expanded in a tensorial form using the cylindrical vector wave functions (CVWFs). Then, by employing the CDSE for the unknown fields, the 2-D volumetric integrals are carried out analytically, reducing the CFVIEs to a set of algebraic equations.

With the decoding principle of QPSK, we attempted to find a solution to reduce the BER for future communication experiments. Based on the results of the ground experiment, the transmitted signals of 2017 Hz at 20 b/s were selected in the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES) reception experiments. In a first, we demonstrate that ELF communication signals generated by the amplitude modulation heating of the ionosphere have been successfully received by the satellite and the ground-based receiver. These experimental results confirm that the ELF/VLF waves radiated by amplitude modulation heating of the auroral electrojet can be used for long-distance communication in future.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3026872","Innovation Fund of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation(grant numbers:KJ1602004); China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES) mission, a Project; China National Space Administration (CNSA) and China Earthquake Administration (CEA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210831","Bit error rate (BER);bit rate;communication;extremely low frequency (ELF)/very low frequency (VLF) virtual antenna;modulated heating;transmission parameters","Heating systems;Phase shift keying;Receivers;Bit error rate;Ground penetrating radar;Geophysical measurement techniques;Antennas","","15","","32","IEEE","1 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, the targeted antennas often have a small number of design variables and specifications, and the surrogate model training time is short. However, modern antennas become increasingly complex, which needs much more design variables and specifications, making the training time become a new bottleneck, i.e., in some cases, even longer than electromagnetic (EM) simulation time. Therefore, a new method, called training cost reduced surrogate model-assisted hybrid differential evolution for complex antenna optimization (TR-SADEA), is presented in this article. The key innovations include: 1) a self-adaptive Gaussian process surrogate modeling method with a significantly reduced training time while mostly maintaining the antenna performance prediction accuracy and 2) a new hybrid surrogate model-assisted antenna optimization framework that reduces the training time and increases the convergence speed. An indoor base station antenna with 2G to 5G cellular bands (45 design variables and 12 specifications) and a 5G outdoor base station antenna (23 design variables and 18 specifications) are used to demonstrate TR-SADEA. Experimental results show that more than 90% of the training time and about 20% iterations (simulations and surrogate modeling) are reduced compared to a state-of-the-art method while obtaining high antenna performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3051034","MathWorks Development Collaboration Research Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328181","5G base station antenna;antenna design;complex antenna;computationally expensive optimization;differential evolution;Gaussian process;radial basis function;surrogate model","Antennas;Optimization;Computational modeling;Training;Predictive models;Sociology;Base stations","","75","","41","Crown","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The vertically polarized wave in the PHA is decomposed into two orthogonal components with equal amplitude. One component perpendicular to the circular polarizer propagates along the PHA as a fast wave, and the other one propagates along the SSPP waveguide as a slow wave. When length of the SSPP waveguide is chosen appropriately, the phase difference between these two components is +90° or -90°, which makes the PHA radiate left-handed or right-handed (LH or RH) waves. Furthermore, the phase differences approximately equal to +90° or -90° over a wide frequency range. As a result, a wideband LH or RH CP PHA is implemented. Since the SSPP waveguide is completely inserted into a standard gain PHA, its volume does not increase at all, and its appearance does not change.

Although TCDA has such characteristics and several advantages compared with others, their bandwidth is still limited by the ground plane (GP) reflection. The use of resistive frequency selective surface (FSS) to overcome this limitation entails ohmic losses which deteriorate the radiation efficiency of the array antenna. In the present study, we propose a 20.9:1 TCDA antenna without resistive FSS. The proposed array antenna employs a PC to overcome the limitation of bandwidth due to GP reflection when the height of the array antenna is 0.5 λ and 1 λ.

By simply inserting a connecting line between two closely spaced open-slot antennas, a top slot structure can be constituted with odd- and even-mode resonances in the lower and higher bands, respectively, to cancel the original strong mutual coupling. In addition to the decoupling effect, the top slot can also expand the effective radiation aperture of the antenna pair for the bandwidth improvement. The proposed slot antenna pair, with a compact footprint of 28 ×7 ×1.8 mm3, shows good impedance matching, isolated and diversity performance across 3.3-5.0 GHz. Then, an 8 ×8 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, constituted by four sets of slot antenna pairs, is simulated, fabricated, and measured. Both the simulated and experimental results show that the 8 ×8 MIMO system can offer isolations of better than 10.8 dB and envelope correlation coefficients (ECCs) of less than 0.14 between all eight ports across 3.3-5.0 GHz. Also, a total efficiency of 55.0%-83.1% and 52.5%-83.1% is achieved for Ant1 and Ant2, respectively.

The proposed design consists of a compact single-port, dual-band antenna, a three-port dual-branch matching network, and two voltage doubler rectifiers implemented with Schottky diodes and terminated with a common 10 kΩ load. For each band, the measured RF-to-dc efficiency is around 60% for a -5 dBm unmodulated signal. The wideband behavior of the rectenna supports harvesting of multitone signals. The use of a six-tone signal increases the maximum RF-to-dc efficiency of the dual-band rectifier, from approximately 60% for a single-tone UHF signal (890 MHz) to 80% for a six-tone signal for a received RF power of -5 dBm in both cases. A signal generator is used to generate a six-tone signal of equally weighted and equally spaced (10 MHz separation) monochromatic tones, with a total bandwidth of 50 MHz. The measurement results demonstrate that the dc voltages rectified from the two separate RF signals are effectively superimposed on the load, providing a clear advantage compared to single-band rectennas.
