Distinct radiation properties with high-gain in the lower band and wide-beam in the upper band could be attained under a small frequency ratio and a single element. The working principle of the wide-beam radiation is, for the first time, proposed and theoretically analyzed based on the electric current calculation, providing a good insightful understanding of the radiation of the inverse currents. The high-gain radiation in the lower band is realized by introducing the shunt inductive effect while maintaining a negligible influence on the upper band. In terms of realization, a pair of stubs and shorting pins are properly loaded on a square patch to achieve the conditions required in the theoretical analysis. It indicates that the proposed method could be easily achieved with the simple structure of a single layer and a single element. Additionally, further discussion on the size reduction of the patch is provided with good cross-polarization. Two prototypes are finally designed, fabricated, and tested. The simulated and measured results exhibit good agreement with each other, certifying the validity of the proposed method. All these attractive merits, such as flexible coverage with high-gain and wide-beam radiations, simple structure with a single element, small achievable frequency ratio, and low profile, demonstrate that the proposed antenna could be a good potential candidate in the modern wireless systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111409","National Natural Science Foundation of China through the General Program(grant numbers:61971475,61571468); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund through the FDCT Research(grant numbers:0095/2019/A2,091/2016/A2); University of Macau under Multi-Year Research(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00007-FST,MYRG2018-00073-FST,CPG2020-00003-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9539045","Dual-band dual-mode (DBDM);high gain;patch antenna;small frequency ratio;wide beam","Patch antennas;Current;Wireless communication;Surface waves;Surface impedance;Pins;Metamaterials","","21","","49","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Frequency components of a short HPMP are distributed in time domain due to different group velocities and partly cutoff on SSPP transmission lines (TLs), leading to peak suppression of HPMP. To illustrate the protection mechanism in real microwave engineering, an SSPP mono-pulse antenna is designed. Sum and difference beam functions of the antenna are demonstrated by both simulations and experiments. For easy comparison, a microstrip mono-pulse antenna is also fabricated. HPMP incidences from the main lobe directions of the sum beam and difference beam are considered. Compared to the microstrip antenna, obvious suppression of HPMPs is observed in the SSPP mono-pulse antenna in different cases, which verifies the better performance to prevent HPMP damages by SSPPs. The proposed technology to suppress HPMPs by using SSPPs can find wide applications in radar and communication systems in the electronic warfare environment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3083836","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101122,61631007,61571117); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:111-2-05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568730","High-power microwave pulse (HPMP);mono-pulse antenna;peak suppression;spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP)","Dispersion;Microstrip antennas;Impedance;Time-domain analysis;Microwave circuits;Microwave antennas;Microwave communication","","23","","38","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reconfiguration module consists of a small flexible printed circuit board (PCB) which integrates a tuning circuitry with commercial snap-on buttons as electronic-to-textile connectors. Using this module equipped with a varactor diode, the frequency reconfigurability of the PIFA is investigated and optimized parametrically for maximum tuning range, exploiting a smooth transition from a quarter-wave to a half-wave patch resonant mode. A fabricated prototype demonstrates a very wide tuning range of approximately 70% (or one octave) with stable directive radiation characteristics, as predicted by simulations.

The antenna is composed of a traditional ME-dipole radiator and a modified aperture-coupled feeding structure. In one aspect, highpass filtering radiation response is realized by approximating the antenna radiator as a highpass filter network. In another aspect, by developing an improved aperture-coupled feeding structure with lowpass filter characteristics, the antenna obtains lowpass filtering radiation response. As a result, bandpass filtering radiation response is achieved. Since no intricate filter resonators are used, the in-band antenna gains are not degraded. The highpass/lowpass filter networks are studied and specific radiation nulls generated by the two networks are analyzed. For demonstration, a single-polarized model is presented first and its working mechanism is studied in detail. It realizes a 78.6% impedance bandwidth, flat in-band gains of 7.5–7.8 dBi, and more than 22 dB out-of-band radiation suppression level.

This article demonstrates that the proposed AiP is  $5.8\,\,\text {mm} \times 19\,\,\text {mm} \times 1.122$  mm. It is believed that this is the smallest 5G AiP that can support a 10 dBi antenna gain, a 10 dB return-loss bandwidth of 3 GHz, and more than 10 dB isolation for both broadside and endfire arrays. AiP consists of a  $1\times 4$  patch antenna array for broadside radiation and a  $1 \times 4$  dipole antenna array for endfire radiation. To miniaturize the patch antenna elements, a multilayer Reactive Impedance Surface (RIS) is embedded between the patch layer and the ground plane. This multilayer RIS idea greatly fits in 5G PCB-stack-up antennas where each stack-up layer essentially requires certain portion of copper area. For the endfire array antenna, miniaturization with bandwidth improvement is achieved by modifying the vertically bent folded dipole antenna (VBFDA) and adding a tightly coupled T-shape side via wall. The AiP achieves a 10 dB return-loss bandwidth of 26.22 to 29.57 GHz and 35.18 to 41.00 GHz for Multilayer RIS Patch Antenna (MLRPA), and 26.40 to 29.74 GHz and 36.65 to 40.72 GHz for VBFDA.

A theoretical model is developed to provide physical insight into the reduction of cross-polarized radiation and to determine the optimal width for the coupled elements. Several types of SPAs were designed and fabricated to validate the analysis.

The proposed antenna is developed using multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) technology. It consists of an SIW feeding structure with a coupling slot, differential-fed  $L$ -shaped probes as well as radiating patches. Such architecture provides wide impedance bandwidth along with good filtering characteristic in the lower stopband. Simultaneously, by introducing a pair of open slots on the individual radiating patch as well as two shorting loops on top of the coupling slot, good filtering response in the upper stopband is obtained. The suppression level in the lower stopband is then further improved by introducing a pair of shorted stubs in the coupling slot region. The proposed filtering antenna features no extra filtering circuits, but has wide bandwidth as well as low profile. To verify the proposed structure and design philosophy, antenna array prototypes have been designed, fabricated, and measured. It achieves a 29% bandwidth from 23.5 to 31.5 GHz.

First, a dual-band antenna element is introduced to achieve dual-sense CP radiation using two pairs of crossed-dipoles for the first time. The right-hand CP (RHCP) wave at lower band is mainly produced by the first-order mode on longer dipole, while the left-hand CP (LHCP) wave at upper band is generated by the combination of first-order mode on shorter dipole and third-order mode on longer dipole. An artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) is used to improve the antenna directivity with low profile and makes this antenna easy to integrate into RFID system. Then, a rotated sequential phase feed CP array is proposed, fabricated, and measured. Measured impedance bandwidth (IBW) for  $\vert \text{S}_{11}\vert < -10$  dB is more than 40.0% at these two bands. Measured 3 dB axial ratio bandwidths (ARBWs) are 32.0% (0.77–1.06 GHz) and 27.8% (2.22–2.95 GHz).

A subreflector extension is included in a feed-down tipping configuration with improved performance over the feed-up case. The resultant optics and feeds achieve very symmetrical patterns with an aperture efficiency of around 95%, a plate scale of 15 arcsec/mm, and first and second sidelobe levels of −18 and −24 dB, respectively. The receiving sensitivity at 30 GHz is 8.7 m2/K and it increases to above 12 m2/K at 12.3 GHz and reduces to 1.5 m2/K at 116 GHz (ignoring the efficiency loss due to nonideal reflector surfaces). These sensitivities are close to the theoretical optimum.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3090827","National Radio Astronomy Observatory, USA; National Research Foundation of South Africa(grant numbers:75322); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465701","Antenna feeds;aperture antennas;optimization methods;radio astronomy;reflector antennas","Reflector antennas;Sensitivity;Optics;Atmospheric modeling;Aperture antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays","","11","","27","IEEE","25 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Regular beam patterns, however, ultimately undermine the system’s competitiveness as they limit the achievable throughput and prevent the full exploitation of the payload’s resources. The reason behind these limitations is the inherent mismatch between the uniform way regular beam patterns provide capacity and the nonuniform distribution of the traffic which results in underloaded beams with surplus capacity and overloaded beams with insufficient capacity to meet the demand. This compels the system to face the paradox of leaving capacity unused while there is still unmet demand. In this contribution, we propose to overcome these limitations by using nonregular beam patterns specifically designed to balance the traffic among beams and match the demand to the supply. We also present a methodology for designing such patterns with excellent results in satellite communications that can be broadly adopted in multiuser/multibeam wireless systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3096209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9489289","Frequency reuse;multibeam antennas;satellite communications;spaceborne antennas","Satellite antennas;Radio frequency;Payloads;Optimization;Lattices;Bandwidth;Throughput","","14","","36","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To validate the concept, the role of FMR in radiation is first derived analytically with an ideal thin-film ferrite radiator. It was concluded that the Gilbert damping of the ferrite, determining the quality factor of FMR, directly impacts on the radiation efficiency of the antenna. A practical example is proposed in the form of an electrically small single-loop antenna loaded with a thin-film yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) core. The prototype has been designed, fabricated, and evaluated through both full-wave simulations and experiments. The simulation results match well to the experimental results, demonstrating the efficacy and significance of the idea. In addition, broadband equivalent circuit models are derived to model both the electrically small loops with and without the FMR enhancement and to provide additional insights into the design.

As a result, the blockage effect of the LB element on the HB antenna array is nearly indistinct. The radiation performance, as well as the S-parameters of the HB elements in the dual-band array, is almost the same as the isolated case. For demonstration, the dual-band aperture-shared antenna array, operating in the LB of 0.69–0.96 GHz (32.7%) and the HB of 3.3–4.2 GHz (24%), is fabricated and measured. Besides, the isolated LB antenna and HB array are designed for comparison.

The triangular lattice is attractive because it has a 15.5% larger cell size compared to the square lattice and can be more naturally truncated into a wide range of aperture shapes such as a rectangle, hexagon, or triangle. Both arrays operate at 3–20 GHz and scan angles out to 60° from normal. The fabrication process is significantly simplified compared to previously published Vivaldi arrays since the antenna is ready for use directly after the standard printing process is complete. This rapid manufacturing is further expedited by printing the “Sub-Miniature Push-on, Micro” (SMPM) connectors directly onto the radiating elements, which simplifies assembly and reduces cost compared to utilizing discrete RF connectors. The arrays have a modular design that allows for combining multiple subarrays together for arbitrarily increasing the aperture size.

Due to the antiphase characteristic between adjacent channels of a power divider based on the TE ${}_{2n,0}$  mode waveguide, the cross-polarized E-field components can cancel each other out in an endfire direction, even in the case of a relatively thick substrate. Moreover, the electric separations between the adjacent channels employed in a traditional substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) power divider can be removed without affecting the field distributions. This facilitates in improving robustness to avoid fabrication errors. Additionally, a general condition of generating a single high-order mode with symmetrical protection is outlined. By combining two antiphase TE30 mode waveguides, an equivalent TE60 mode waveguide with six identical output channels is realized. To feed a 12-element array, two equivalent TE60 mode waveguides are employed as an equivalent TE12,0 mode-feeding network.

Most of the proposed techniques commonly require time division multiplexing at the transmitter side or beam splitters at the reception side for separating OAM modes and directing beams of different OAM modes to different directions. To overcome this problem, here, the concept of aperture sharing for generating concentrically embedded OAM-carrying beams is presented. Such a methodology provides embedded beams of various OAM modes which are launched toward a single direction through a shared aperture of transmitarray (TA), while having a spatial division between them. In this manner, the transmitted beams are initially separated by the hardware at the transmitter level. A novel circularly polarized (CP) substrate-coupled unit cell is designed and used as the elemental components on the aperture of the TA.

In practice, traveling-wave modulation is achieved by applying staggered time-modulation signals to a spatially discrete array of unit cells. Therefore, the capability to accurately simulate spatially discrete traveling-wave modulated structures is critical to the design. However, simulating these structures is challenging due to the complex space–time dependence of the constituent unit cells. In this article, a field relation (referred to as the interpath relation) is derived for spatially discrete traveling-wave modulated structures. The interpath relation reveals that the field within a single time-modulated unit cell (rather than an entire spatial period) is sufficient to determine the field solution throughout space. It will be shown that the interpath relation can be incorporated into the existing periodic method of moment solvers simply by modifying the source basis functions. As a result, the computational domain is reduced from an entire spatial period to a single time-modulated unit cell, dramatically reducing the number of unknowns. In the context of traveling-wave modulation, this enables researchers to efficiently simulate both complex structures with patterned unit cells in addition to continuous structures with infinitesimal unit cells.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111337","Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Multidisciplinary Research Program of the University Research Initiative (MURI) Program(grant numbers:FA9550-18-1-0379); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9539052","Computational techniques;frequency-domain methods;interpath relation;metasurfaces;method of moments (MoM);N-path networks;periodic structures;space–time modulation;spatially discrete traveling-wave modulation (SDTWM);traveling-wave modulation","Modulation;Harmonic analysis;Metasurfaces;Time-frequency analysis;Method of moments;Voltage;Varactors","","13","","37","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the degree of the singularity increases, the shape-dependent problem of strong near-singularity is more severe than that of the weakly near-singular integrals. Furthermore, if the source triangle is deformed, the accuracy of the cancellation methods decreases when no near singularity exists.

The radome is decomposed into a hierarchy of subdomains (SDs) by an adaptive algorithm that closely follows the radome geometry, allowing significant savings in memory and CPU time. In the MLNG algorithm, only local generalized impedance matrices of the finest level SDs are evaluated. Far-zone potentials and fields are indirectly evaluated through a multilevel aggregation involving phase-and amplitude-compensated interpolation on nonuniform grids (NGs), requiring considerably fewer calculations as compared with the classical method of moments (MoM). The MLNG algorithm is incorporated in a preconditioned iterative solver. Accuracy as well as memory consumption and computation times of the algorithm are studied on realistic examples. The radome effect on the antenna input impedance and electric current density distribution is demonstrated.

Nearby interactions involve the singularity of the kernel, and must instead be computed accurately with direct integration at each frequency of interest, which can be computationally expensive. We propose a novel algorithm for reducing the cost-per-frequency of near-region computations for both homogeneous and layered background media. In the proposed extended AIM (AIMx), the SIE operators are decomposed into a frequency-independent term containing the singularity of the kernel, and a nonsingular frequency-dependent term. Direct integration is only required for the frequency-independent term and can be reused at each frequency, leading to significantly faster frequency sweeps. The frequency-dependent term is captured with good accuracy using fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based acceleration even in the near region, as confirmed with an error analysis. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated through numerical examples drawn from several applications, and CPU times are significantly reduced by factors ranging from 3 to 16.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3090535","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Collaborative Research and Development Grants Program); Advanced Micro Devices; CMC Microsystems; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464741","Adaptive integral method (AIM);electromagnetic modeling;fast frequency sweep;surface integral equations (SIEs)","Green's function methods;Taylor series;Integral equations;Nonhomogeneous media;Kernel;Matrix decomposition;Mathematical model","","17","","60","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Propagation models are required to design and analyze longwave radio links and act as a forward model in the nonlinear inversion of receiver measurements to estimate the ionosphere. We have developed software that applies a mode theory to calculate the distant fields produced by a dipole emitter in the Earth–ionosphere waveguide. This model, released as the Julia package LongwaveModePropagator.jl, is similar to the Long-Wavelength Propagation Capability (LWPC) but replaces the mode solver with the global complex roots and poles finding (GRPF) algorithm. As a result, mode finding is more robust and the model is simplified by solving the physical mode equation. This article presents an overview of the model physics and validates the new longwave mode propagator by comparing results with different ionospheres to LWPC and a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) propagation model.

The modeling of propagation in a mixed LOS/SLOS environment is thus important in system design. For modeling propagation in an SLOS environment, the application of the Loo model developed for land mobile satellite service with roadside shadowing is promising because this model reflects the physical mechanism of radio propagation. However, the model is inconvenient in practice because its calculation involves numerical integration over an infinite range. In this article, we approximate the Loo distribution using three basic distributions, namely the Nakagami-Rice distribution (or Rician distribution), Nakagami-m distribution, and lognormal distribution. Based on the evaluation results, we propose the use of the Nakagami-m distribution in place of the Loo distribution.

Recognizing whether the measured antenna-efficiency estimate is significantly affected by electronic noise is not trivial. The measured  $S$ -parameters used for calculation may have high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), but the antenna-efficiency estimate can still show large systematic errors due to noise. We model noise as a component of the measured stirred energy, showing that the measured reflection is much more susceptible to noise than the measured transmission. We do not focus on the origin of the noise, but rather on the effect it has on the measurement. We show the effect of noise on the overestimation of the stirred energy components of the  $S$ -parameters, which affects the two-antenna formulation more significantly than the three-antenna method one. We show that this overestimation can cause efficiency estimates calculated with the two- and three-antenna methods to be significantly over- or under-estimated and we show that uncertainties increase as well. Finally, we provide clear steps to recognize and reduce noise effects in antenna efficiency measurements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3083822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445645","Antenna efficiency;Internet-of-Things (IoT);microwave measurement;noise;reverberation chambers (RCs);uncertainty;wireless system","Antenna measurements;Antennas;Broadband antennas;Noise measurement;Antenna accessories;Frequency measurement;Energy measurement","","9","","56","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The primary reason is the increasing complexity of antenna topologies, a typically large number of adjustable parameters that have to be simultaneously tuned. Design closure is no longer possible using traditional methods, including theoretical models or supervised parameter sweeping. To ensure reliability, optimization is normally carried out at the level of full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations, which incurs major computational expenses. The issue can be alleviated using a variety of methods such as the incorporation of adjoint sensitivities, sparse sensitivity updates (for local optimization), or the employment of surrogate modeling methods (in the context of global search). Another possibility is utilization of variable-fidelity simulation models, which, in practice, is most often restricted to two levels (coarse/fine or low-/high-fidelity models), and accompanied by appropriate low-fidelity model correction (e.g., space mapping). This article proposes an accelerated version of a trust-region (TR) gradient-based procedure, which involves simulation model management by continuous adjustment of EM analysis fidelity throughout the optimization process. Decision-making process is based on the convergence status of the algorithm. The initial stages of the optimization run are executed using the coarsest discretization of the structure at hand with the model being gradually refined toward the end of the process. This enables considerable computational savings without degrading the quality of the final design. The presented approach has been comprehensively validated using a benchmark set of four broadband antennas and compared with the reference TR procedure and two state-of-the-art accelerated algorithms. The average computational savings are almost 60% as compared with the reference.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3083742","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:217771); National Science Centre of Poland(grant numbers:2020/37/B/ST7/01448); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445647","Decision making;electromagnetic (EM)-driven optimization;model management;multifidelity simulations","Optimization;Antennas;Numerical models;Computational modeling;Sensitivity;Analytical models;Broadband antennas","","35","","68","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, practical optimization faces several major challenges, including high cost of massive evaluations of antenna characteristics, normally involving full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis, large numbers of adjustable variables, the shortage of reasonable initial solutions in the case of topologically complex structures, and multimodality of the objective function landscapes. The last two reasons foster the use of global search routines, which might be prohibitively expensive. This article proposes a novel procedure for efficient and reliable antenna optimization by means of design specification adaptation. Using appropriate selection criteria and predictions from a linear expansion model, the ability of improving the current design is verified, and—in the case of a negative outcome—performance requirements are temporarily relaxed. The adjustment is carried out prior to each iteration of the optimization process with the specifications eventually converging to their original levels. The algorithm is intended to improve the efficacy of local optimizers if the target operating frequencies of the structure at hand are severely misaligned with respect to those at the available initial design. This eliminates the need for global routines and greatly enhances the robustness of the search process, as demonstrated using several antenna structures optimized under different scenarios.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3083792","Icelandic Center for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:217771); Gdańsk University of Technology through the Argentum Triggering Research Grants Program–Excellence Initiative–Research University(grant numbers:DEC-41/ 2020/IDUB/I.3.3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445679","Antenna design;design specification adaptation;electromagnetic (EM)-driven optimization;multiband antennas;parameter tuning","Optimization;Antennas;Tuning;Task analysis;Reliability engineering;Adaptive arrays;Robustness","","15","","40","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the accuracy of the RTS method has not been theoretically investigated. In this article, an uncertainty analysis on the throughput performance using the RTS method with regard to the reporting errors in the device under test (DUT) reporting system is presented. A mathematical model of the RTS method is constructed and error factors are introduced. Based on the analysis, the reporting errors in the DUT antenna pattern measurement are eliminated using the proposed RTS implementation in the final throughput evaluations. In other words, the RTS method is free of the effects of the DUT reporting errors, contributing to the accuracy and consistency of the test. An example DUT was tested to demonstrate the impact of the reporting errors and validate that the reporting errors are eliminated in the proposed RTS implementation.

This study aims at developing a new technique suitable for electromagnetic (EM) tool in the microwave band to differentiate steatotic from nonsteatotic liver. A differential permittivity estimation method for hepatic steatosis detection is proposed. First, the effective permittivity of the right side of the torso is estimated based on the phase difference of EM waves traveling along symmetric paths within the torso. Then, permittivity modeling and statistical frequency selection are performed to model the estimated values and to extract reliable frequency samples. Finally, the percentage of the difference between the permittivity of the left and right sides of the torso is calculated over the selected samples. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using simulated signals and phantom measurements. The analyzed results reveal higher contrast between the average permittivity of the left and right sides of the torso for cases with hepatic steatosis (average contrast of 29.2%) compared to those with healthy liver (average contrast of 7.9%). The proposed method can differentiate between steatotic and nonsteatotic liver. It is suitable for clinical applications due to its robustness to unwanted noise and interferences, as well as errors in placement of sensors. The results verify the potential of EM devices, which could overcome shortcomings of traditional imaging techniques by being safe, cost-effective, and portable.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3090508","Cooperative Research Centers Projects(grant numbers:CRC-P-516); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464755","Electromagnetic (EM) imaging;hepatic steatosis;permittivity estimation;scattering parameters","Permittivity;Torso;Liver;Scattering parameters;Electromagnetics;Permittivity measurement;Antenna measurements","","6","","41","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Those antennas are usually fed by a surface-wave (SW) launcher, which evenly illuminates the MTS versus azimuth, through a cylindrical SW. When the interest lies in generating pencil beams or particular types of shaped beams, the required radiating aperture field (linked to the Fourier transform of the desired radiation pattern) on the MTS is almost azimuthally symmetric in amplitude. However, for a wide class of shaped beams, the desired aperture field is far from being azimuthally symmetric. This leads to an MTS design in which some sectors exhibit a very small surface impedance modulation. Those sectors tend to leave the SW intact until it reaches the rim of the surface, where the power is either reflected or diffracted at the slab rim. We solve this efficiency problem by reducing the amount of power fed into some sectors, through the use of an array of feeding monopoles. The azimuthal illumination of the feeder should be designed to match the azimuthal asymmetry of the desired aperture field. The corresponding MTS surface impedance is then determined using a method of moments (MoM)-based synthesis technique. Several examples are provided to illustrate the concept.

However, real-world implementation issues introduce inevitable nonideal effects that can significantly affect the quality of calibration. In this communication, a 2 GHz standard dipole (SD) antenna is presented with an excellent overall performance. This result is achieved by an innovative design with an optimized element shape and an embedded (shielded) balun. The designed feeding structure is a balanced structure that transitions from parallel strip lines to coaxial lines. The feeding method avoids the impact of electromagnetic environment asymmetry while achieving an appropriate balance. The measured relative bandwidth of the dipole exceeds 15%, and the antenna gain is approximately 2 dBi. The cross-polarization ratio is greater than 27 dB in the horizontal plane, and the horizontal gain variation is less than 0.2 dB. The dipole has a symmetrical vertical plane pattern, and the maximum gain point does not deviate from the horizontal plane. The high performance of this SD makes it suitable for antenna calibration.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3091637","National Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Program of China(grant numbers:2020SKA0110300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9466438","Antenna calibration;embedded balun;optimized element shape;standard dipole (SD)","Baluns;Dipole antennas;Conductors;Inductors;Gain;Antenna measurements;Coaxial cables","","10","","23","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, the realized gain is usually with a large variation, which limits the wideband performance of SCMSA. In this communication, a feasible method is proposed to stabilize the realized gain of an SCMSA over its entire impedance bandwidth by utilizing a properly designed reflector-plus-sidewall structure (RPSS), which includes a reflector with an optimized height and two vertical sidewalls.

On the other hand, inverse scattering algorithms often assume that the background medium of the imaging system extends to infinity (i.e., unbounded background medium assumption). Thus, they typically do not consider the reflections occurring at the system enclosure. For such algorithms to yield successful images, these reflections need to be minimized, e.g., via the use of a lossy coupling liquid. As an alternative to a lossy background medium which also reduces the desired signal level, this communication investigates the use of metallic-backed absorbing metasurfaces as the MWI system enclosure in order to 1) reduce these reflections and also 2) to shield the MWI system from external interference. Using simulated data, we then show that standard inverse scattering algorithms, employing the free-space assumption, can successfully process the data collected under the metasurface enclosure and yield acceptable permittivity images. The advantages and disadvantages of absorbing metasurface enclosure, along with the limitations of this study, will also be discussed.

Nevertheless, since the time-domain EM simulation is a dynamic process, a static refinement is not applicable. In this communication, an efficient dynamic p-adaptation method based on hierarchical vector basis functions having the property of nesting to facilitate the construction of basis functions has been developed for the discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method. In this approach, based on the relationship between the amplitude of the expansion coefficients of hierarchical vector basis functions and the corresponding expansion coefficients of the physical quantities captured by each element in the previous time step, an error estimator is proposed to determine the order of each element in the next time step. To reduce the computational overhead, the basis orders of each element can be dynamically adjusted when the pulse passes through or is dissipated. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3090578","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801009); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2020JM-515); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464725","Discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method;dynamic p-adaptation;hierarchical vector basis functions","Interpolation;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Electromagnetics;Adaptation models;Time-domain analysis;Real-time systems","","10","","22","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
