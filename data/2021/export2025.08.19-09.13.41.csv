At first, a 1-D, full-wavelength dipole is evolved into a 2-D, sectorial dipole, so as to determine its two usable resonant modes. Then, both wideband and wide beamwidth characteristics are simultaneously attained under dual-mode resonance. Next, dual-resonant sectorial dipole antennas with flared angle of 270° and 240° are designed and studied. As experimentally validated, the proposed antenna exhibits an omnidirectional pattern with its impedance bandwidth over 70.4%. A few prototypes mounted above a ground plane are further investigated, so as to achieve a broad H-plane half-power beamwidth (HPBW) to over 120°. In addition, the antennas exhibit stable gain frequency response with fluctuation less than 2.2 dB within the entire impedance bandwidth. Thus, the advanced design approach based on 2-D dual-resonant, full- wavelength dipole leads to the formulation of novel wide beamwidth antennas with low frequency dispersion and simple configuration within a wide radiation bandwidth over 53.3%.

The most significant reason behind using liquid salt water for transparent antenna applications is its excellent average optical transparency (OTav) (>95% at salinity of 40 ppt) compared with other typical solid transparent thin-film electrodes such as indium tin oxide (>73%) or multilayer films (>78%). Each conductive arm of the proposed dipole is constructed from a salt-water layer held between two clear planar acrylic layers (εr = 2.61, tan δ = 0.01, OTav > 90%) (acrylic/salt water/acrylic; ASA) due to surface tension. To investigate the electrical and optical properties of the ASA structure, we analyze the surface tension to determine the thickness of the salt-water layer that finalizes its sheet resistance and OTav. The average gain and efficiency of the antenna are 1.72 dBi and 74%, respectively, in the operating UHF band. This makes the proposed antenna a good candidate for application as a transparent external antenna in UHD TVs and proves that it is possible to use salt water for high-frequency devices.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3008637","Korean government(grant numbers:2016R1D1A1B02012957); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142358","Dipole antenna;planar antenna;salt water;surface tension;transparent antenna","Surface tension;Dipole antennas;Conductivity;TV;Salinity (geophysical);Resistance","","6","","20","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the actual mechanism that governs the antenna radiation efficiency remains unclear, although various models have been developed since the 1940s. Extant circuit models are either intuition-based or mathematic representations of input impedance/far-field spherical mode functions for structurally simple antennas with limited uses and physical insight. In this article, a recently developed physical micromodeling circuit (MMC) model is utilized to explain the nature of radiation of an electrically small antenna of arbitrary configuration. It is theoretically discovered and experimentally validated for the first time that the radiation efficiency decisively depends on mutual radiated power associated with partial segments of the antenna. A circuital figure of merit for describing the total mutual radiated power is introduced to quantify the measure. The graphical representation of the figure of merit called the holographic radiation diagram is also proposed for illustrating the correspondence of the positive and negative radiated power and the antenna structure. The applications of the proposed theory to antenna design is demonstrated by designing a highly efficient loop antenna. The physical circuit model paves a new way of understanding electromagnetic (EM) radiation problems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3008676","University Grants Committee of Hong Kong(grant numbers:AoE/P-04/08); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142368","Antenna;antenna couplings;circuit model;radiation efficiency","Integrated circuit modeling;Antenna radiation patterns;Mathematical model;Antenna theory;RLC circuits;Resistance","","19","","32","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design technique accounts for mutual coupling between distinct reflectarray elements. Contrary to the conventional approach, no local periodicity assumptions are made in the design of the reflectarray elements. The reflectarray considered consists of a subwavelength-patterned metallic cladding (metasurface) over a ground plane. The cladding is homogenized and modeled as an inhomogeneous impedance sheet. The inhomogeneous impedance sheet is designed through the solution of an integral equation. The integral equation is solved using the method of moments. In the design, both the scattered field amplitude and phase are specified. The scattered field amplitude is chosen to conserve local power density at the reflectarray surface. This condition results in complex sheet impedances. An optimization technique is subsequently used to obtain a purely reactive sheet which gives the same performance as the complex sheet. The process used to extract the reactance of printed geometries is detailed. An example of a 20λ wide array is presented. All the results are validated through COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. The presented design approach is compared to the conventional approach and is shown to more accurately predict the far-field patterns of a reflectarray.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3001450","Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-19-1-0359); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-18- 1-2536); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119196","metasurface;method of moments (MoM);reflectarray antenna;sheet impedance","Impedance;Surface impedance;Integral equations;Density measurement;Power system measurements;Mutual coupling","","88","","20","IEEE","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With successive forward and backward Fourier transforms, the traditional IFT can be capable of thinning large arrays with high convergence rates, but easily get trapped in local optima. The proposed PLIFT utilizes the probability estimation to describe the elements with possible states of “ON” and “OFF” in a thinned array. A probability model is then adopted to determine the locations of elements in the thinned array featuring minimum sidelobe level. In this PLIFT, on the one hand, the probability model of density taper is learned in optimization process and gradually trained to approach the global optima. With the previous information being honored, the probability model taper proves to be reliable and effective in generating diverse competitive seeds, which, in turn, helps training an optimal probability distribution to best-fit the design goal.

Then, we formulate a new optimization problem aiming to minimize the peak sidelobe level (PSL) and the LV norm under the constraints of power beampattern and subarray layout. The resulting problem is quite challenging to solve due to the highly nonconvex discrete LV and double-sided quadratic constraints. In this respect, we formulate the resultant hybrid optimization problem into a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) form via introducing a series of auxiliary variables, and propose an approximation algorithm based on ADMM. In each iteration of the proposed ADMM, the tractable and small-sized subproblems are globally or locally solved in parallel. Finally, numerical simulations show that the proposed method can obtain a lower PSL beampattern and a thinner (i.e., fewer REs or subarrays) array while satisfying the given constraints.

Mutual interactions between the array elements are modeled by approximating the incident field as a single dual-polarized plane wave taken from the spherical wave expansion of the scattered field from any other element in the array.

First, the FSSs' shielding performance in both far-field (FF) and NF zones is considered using the finite element method (FEM) based on the cell shielding effectiveness (SE). Analytical derivations of the FF- and NF-SE are presented, incorporating the equivalent circuit model and infinitesimal electric/magnetic source model, respectively. A nonlinear regression learning approach is utilized to predict an acceptable NF model. In the comparison study, the edge diffraction effects due to the finite structures are taken into consideration for 1-D and 2-D diffractions. The NF-SE performance of conformal structures is analyzed based on the radii of curvature. When the structure is bent, the movement of the desired transmission zero in the NF region intensely degrades the NF-SE, which may lead to a highly unstable shielding performance. Moreover, data sets are extracted for efficient usage of the structures under test by introducing two useful reconfigurable parameters, distance and radius. For verification, the FEM results are compared with the method of moment (MOM) results.

As the spectrum spreading induces a drastic reduction of the power spectral density of the signal, the level of the scattered wave falls below the noise floor of the interrogating radar, and the object covered by the metasurface is hence perfectly camouflaged to a foe radar.

Under normal incident, reflected waves will be split into multiple beams whose directions can be flexibly controlled. We designed a prototype, implemented our design, and carried out experiments. Both the simulation and experiment results show that the number of reflected beams can be reconfigured between 1 and 5. Reflect beam number reconfigurability of such metasurfaces can be readily used as planar reflector of antennas and may find applications in wireless communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3010801","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971435); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901508); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149818","Coding metasurface;multibeam antenna;pattern reconfigurable;planar reflector","Encoding;Antenna radiation patterns;Varactors;Reflection;Integrated circuit modeling;Keyboards;Reflector antennas","","70","","29","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Surface integrals resulting from the application of the method of moments using the Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions can then be directly evaluated by means of elementary quadrature rules irrespective of the singularity location. The proposed technique can be applied to simple and composite surfaces comprising two or more overlapping components. The use of composite surfaces can significantly simplify the geometric treatment of complex structures, as the density interpolation method enables the use of separate nonconformal meshes for the discretization of each of the surface components that make up the composite surface.

The new DSRF-based meshing technique provides a framework for generation of meshes with high element quality, aimed to greatly enhance the accuracy, conditioning properties, stability, robustness, and efficiency of surface integral equation CEM solutions. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed DSRF technique to produce meshes with near-optimal element corner angles for complicated, highly varied surfaces such as the NASA almond and a fighter jet model, using triangular, quadrilateral, and discontinuous quadrilateral elements. Other element types are also discussed. Where high-fidelity meshing is desired, the technique can capture fine-scale detail using very few high-order elements.

This article proposes an alternative criterion based on global sampling of the error in the elements of the ACA compressed matrix. The sampling error depends not only on the size of the sample but also on the population distribution of the error, which makes it difficult to control the error independently of the underlying problem. However, as argued and demonstrated in this article, the distribution of the error converges to the same unique probability distribution function for all low-rank matrices. Complementing the sampling criterion with a simple mechanism to detect this convergence, we arrive at a criterion that controls the error irrespective of the underlying problem. As a practical example, the RCS of a moderate size metallic ogive is computed to illustrate the merits of the proposed criterion.

The image reconstruction problem suffers from a high computation cost because of its inherent nonlinearity. Current state-of-the-art numerical methods are based on the finite element method (FEM). To avoid artifacts at the boundaries, this method requires the discretization of a volume much larger than the actual volume of interest. A numerical model based on volume integrals only requires the discretization of the volume of interest, which greatly reduces the number of unknowns. Fewer unknowns generally imply a lower computation cost. However, a naive implementation of the volume integral equation does not yield a lower computation cost due to the bad conditioning arising from the high dielectric property values of biological tissues at low frequencies. To tackle this problem, a model based on inhomogeneous Green's function is proposed. The forward model is validated with the Mie scattering theory. Through the resolution of the inverse problem, it is found that the reconstruction limits compare well with current state-of-the-art methods. By reducing the number of unknowns and maintaining a similar computational complexity, the proposed model offers a computation cost reduction when compared with the FEM.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3008618","Partial support for this work was provided bu a Discovery grant of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142374","Biomedical magnetic induction tomography (MIT);inhomogeneous Green’s (IG) function;volume integral","Magnetic resonance imaging;Numerical models;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Convergence;Image reconstruction","","2","","52","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The gratings are single-groove perfectly conducting gratings that support two propagating guided modes (opposed to typical single-mode cases). It is shown under what conditions one can achieve blazing over a wide range of frequencies and angles. Most importantly, it is identified what governs blazing, in particular the true matching condition that needs to be satisfied, and how the structures' multiple resonances play role in achieving such matching and tailoring the bandwidth. Parameters of the proposed equivalent circuit model for the case of the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization are analytically derived. The accuracy of the models is verified through a comparison against the results of full-wave simulations. The procedure to achieve wide-band/angle blazing performance is delineated, and the design parameters are explicitly given. It is shown that this structure can strongly transfer the power of the TM polarized incident wave to the -1st diffraction order with a fractional bandwidth of ≈50% at working frequency $f_{0}=10$ GHz and for -10 dB specular reflection loss, thus realizing a broadband structure.

The proposed approach reformulates the initial problem using equivalent currents over a domain surrounding the object. The equivalent currents then act as new sources that induce electrical currents computed by the classical PO formulation.

Instead, depending on the exponent and the material properties of the layered medium, outgoing and exponentially increasing or incoming and exponentially decreasing waves are generated. This property is not observed when the exponent is real where the classical Sommerfeld radiation condition is fulfilled. In this article, an in-depth analysis of layered media is first performed in spectral domain as a function of the longitudinal dependence of the line sources.

Recently, two symmetric nonuniform linear arrays (NLAs), symmetric nested array (SNA) and compressed SNA (CSNA), have been developed to enhance the positioning performance by their advantages in the degrees of freedom and the array aperture over symmetric ULAs. In this article, we devise a new symmetric NLA, termed symmetric displaced coprime array (SDCA), to locate the NF and FF sources simultaneously. The SDCA configuration consists of three sparse ULAs with a certain displacement, implying there are two displaced coprime arrays with one common subarray. For a given number of sensors, the SDCA configuration is solely determined by a closed-form expression and its consecutive coarray ranges can also be analytically computed. In addition, we derive two optimum SDCA configurations by maximizing the number of the unique and consecutive lags in the difference coarray. Compared with the SNA and the CSNA, the SDCA provides more unique and consecutive virtual sensors, as well as a larger physical array aperture. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the superiorities of the SDCA configuration over the existing symmetric NLAs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3005203","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871391); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2019YJ0191); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:2672018ZYGX2018J003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9132699","Difference coarray;direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;nonuniform linear array (NLA);range estimation;symmetric displaced coprime array (SDCA)","Noise measurement;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Apertures;Estimation;Sensor arrays;Array signal processing","","80","","61","IEEE","2 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A wireless cable method, which can achieve cable testing functionality without actual radio frequency (RF) cable connection, has recently been considered a strong alternative to conductive testing method. However, its applicability to high-order MIMO antenna systems is mainly limited by the calibration complexity in the literature. To tackle this issue, a novel closed-form calibration method is proposed, which can largely speed up the calibration procedure and make the testing method practical for MIMO devices of arbitrary orders. Some practical factors affecting the calibration performance are discussed with numerical simulations. The proposed algorithm is further experimentally validated for a device under test (DUT) with four antennas in the 3.45-3.55 GHz frequency band.

The working principle is verified on a differentially fed circular patch antenna operating in TM31 and TM12 modes at first.

An additional slot is introduced at the patch center to perturb the TM12 mode and reshape its current to be more in-phase, by which sidelobe radiation is dramatically reduced. With use of loading of slots and shorting pins, the two modes are allocated in resonant frequencies to make up an enhanced bandwidth of 13.4% and produce high gain up to 13.7 dBi, with the beamwidth and gain level nearly unchanged in band. Then, the proposed method is further developed on a rectangular patch antenna, where three cascaded slots and four shorting pins are loaded to perturb TM21 and TM03 modes, and reshape their current distributions. In a similar way, the broadside radiation of TM21 mode is enhanced and the sidelobe of TM03 mode is suppressed.

This method consists of the initial step and a few refining steps. At the initial step, an initial array with dense elements distributed on a circular-arc is considered, and its array manifold vector is described by rotating a simulated isolated element pattern (IEP) without considering element mutual coupling. The collective excitation coefficient vector (CECV) and its energy bound are introduced for each element, and consequently, the common element positions for generating desired multibeam patterns can be found by minimizing the number of active CECVs under multiple constraints. This minimization problem is further formulated as performing a sequence of alternating convex optimization (ACO) in which the CECV and an auxiliary weighting vector are alternately chosen as the optimization variables so that the minimum element spacing constraint can be easily dealt with. Once the initial optimization step is finished, a few refining steps are performed in which the element positions and excitations are successively updated in each step by renewing the array manifold vector through rotating the simulated nearby active element patterns (AEPs) of the antenna array obtained at the previous step. In such a way, the mutual coupling can be incorporated into the multibeam sparse array synthesis. An example of synthesizing a sparse circular-arc conformal array with 23 beams covering the space from −63.25° to 63.25° is conducted to validate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2999660","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61871338); Joint Fund Ministry of Education(grant numbers:6141A02033338); University of Technology Sydney; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9112666","Alternating convex optimization (ACO);minimum element spacing control;multibeam pattern synthesis;sparse circular-arc array","Optimization;Mutual coupling;Linear antenna arrays;Convex functions;Directive antennas;Acoustic beams","","16","","32","IEEE","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The digital antenna unit has two scattering states that are controlled by p-i-n diodes. For $y$ -polarized normally incident waves, the phases of the two reflected states exhibit a 180° phase difference at approximately 5 GHz. For $x$ -polarized incident waves, the antenna units act as meta-absorbers, and the incident power is absorbed by the antenna units. Moreover, the radiation properties of these two states are approximately the same at 5 GHz. Thus, the scattering patterns of the antenna array can be tuned by controlling the scattering states of the digital antenna units without affecting the radiation performance. By tuning the directions of the scattering pattern nulls to dynamically align to the direction of the incident wave, both the monostatic and bistatic RCS can be significantly reduced. An $8\,\, {\times }\,\,8$ antenna array was fabricated and measured to validate the proposed concept. The measured results are in good agreement with the simulated ones.

In this communication, we study a fast algorithm for the full-wave modeling of the quasi-periodic arrays. It constructs a reduced basis set based on the geometric similarities among the array elements. Then, we use linear projection to “recover” periodicity numerically so that the fast Fourier transform can be used to accelerate the computation of the whole array.

To enable investigation of electrically large geometries, the methodology employs simplified expressions for the compressed memory and fast low-rank (LR)-approximation techniques. The study indicates that a block's optimal BF-compression is obtained for a nontrivial choice of the BF's depth, determined by the underlying geometrical configuration and compression threshold. It is also shown that reduced-dimensionality interactions are more BF-compressible. In particular, the optimal compressibility for the recently introduced generalized equivalence and generalized source integral equations is shown to be dependent on their effective dimensionality, which is dictated by the compression threshold. At high thresholds, these formulations are more BF-compressible than their conventional counterparts. The implications for the design of BF-compression-based solvers, in a geometrically adaptive manner, are discussed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3000532","Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(grant numbers:677/18); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115872","Fast solvers;integral equations (IEs);moment methods","Observers;Skeleton;Kernel;Geometry;Method of moments;Antennas;Integral equations","","6","","40","IEEE","12 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The phase difference between the electric and magnetic currents in the Huygens source is utilized to finely control the ratio of the wave propagation amplitudes and, hence, power flows along the transmission line in opposite directions. The operating principles are elucidated with both the field distributions in a rectangular waveguide as the transmission line system and the voltages and currents in a transmission line circuit model driven by Huygens sources. The transmission line circuit models excited with electric and magnetic current sources separately and with their balanced combination provide a precise means to quantitatively demonstrate the tunability of the power flow with the Huygens source. A proof-of-concept experiment was implemented in a microwave rectangular waveguide to validate the theoretical analysis.

In this communication, a new method for the estimation of the complex permittivities based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm and free-space measurement is proposed. Compared with classical particle swarm optimization (PSO) and chaos PSO (CPSO), QPSO is robust and efficient in searching the global optima. The complex permittivities of four cloth materials (linen, leatherette, polyester fiber, and latex mattress) are extracted from the measured transmission and reflection coefficients for perpendicular polarization over 40-50 GHz, and the accuracy is verified by comparing the calculated and measured reflection coefficients at other incident angles.

The main problem of the existing techniques lies in the contradiction between the imaging speed and the system cost. In this respect, a cylindrical sparse multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) array topology is proposed, which has no mechanical scanning so as to achieve fast sampling process. Furthermore, it can provide more angular observations than the mainly used systems with a planar aperture. To speed up the image reconstruction process, a phase center approximation-based transformation is made to convert the multistatic sampling scheme to its monostatic counterpart for which there are more fast and tractable imaging algorithms. Then, a phase calibration method is presented after we analyze the error of such an equivalence. In so doing, the cylindrical MIMO topology is transformed into an approximate monostatic one. Finally, a wavenumber domain algorithm is employed to attain the fast image reconstruction.
