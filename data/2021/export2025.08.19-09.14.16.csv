In this study, the classical method that extends the discrete set of points into flat triangular facets on the basis of which the far-field is calculated is considerably upgraded. The innovation is that the proposed method makes full use of the exact knowledge of the systematic error between the ideal reflector surface and its faceted counterpart, and uses this known systematic error to upgrade the calculation of the mechanically deformed reflector, whose surface is composed of corresponding planar facets. Two versions are introduced, the single-grid version and the double-grid version. The double-grid version makes use of a double grid to even further refine the description of the systematic error. Based on this, the dichotomy method is used to quickly obtain the maximum size of the facets that still results in the required precision of the far-field calculation. In the examples given, concerning 50 m standard and 33 m offset reflector antennas operated at 60 GHz, the size of the small facets can be relaxed considerably, yielding much larger facets (such as more than 200 times the operating wavelength for the 50-m standard antenna) for a required far-field accuracy of -60 dB with respect to the main lobe level.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060100","Doctoral Research Start Project of Xinjiang University(grant numbers:620320037); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2015CB857100); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B14042); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51775404,U19037202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405418","Accuracy;far-field pattern;large reflector antenna","Reflector antennas;Systematics;Aperture antennas;Optimization;Surface waves;Surface fitting;Mechanical engineering","","1","","32","IEEE","15 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna uses the inherent silicon substrate in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies as a rectangular dielectric resonator (DR), that is, the CIDR. This CIDR can be seen as a standard dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) or a magnetic wall cavity with in-phase reflected waves from the ground. A versatile comb-shaped dipole antenna is designed above the silicon CIDR, functioning both as a feeder for the DRA and an independent radiator. With the proper design of the CIDR and the dipole, multiple higher order DR modes and the cavity mode are simultaneously excited, namely, hybrid DR-cavity modes. The hybrid modes greatly expand the bandwidth and improve the gain. Simulations show that the -10 dB impedance bandwidth and 3 dB gain bandwidth are 50% and 34.5%, respectively, while a peak gain of 6.5 dBi is achieved at 305 GHz. For validation, the antenna is fabricated using the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) 65 nm CMOS technology and tested by dedicated THz measurement setups. The fabricated sample shows a peak gain of 8.6 dBi and a maximum radiation efficiency of 44% at 295 GHz. Meanwhile, low cross-polarization levels and stable patterns are also observed. The features of wide bandwidth, high gain, and low profile make the antenna a good candidate in fully integrated THz transceiver systems.

In this article, the relationships between the hand effects and the radiation patterns of the antennas are investigated using characteristic mode theory. First, we calculate the characteristic far fields of a typical monopole-loaded handset antenna with metal frames. Afterward, the radiation patterns of the handset antenna are simulated and obtained in two different scenarios, i.e., in free space and with hand. Then we map the antenna patterns in two scenarios to the characteristic mode patterns by calculating the weighting coefficients, which stand for the power contributions of the modes. By inspecting the variations of the weighting coefficients in free space and with hands, it is found that the modes with less radiation at the boresight and the backward directions are more robust to the hands. Accordingly, a handset antenna with little radiating power toward the boresight is designed. Compared to the reference antenna with the same feeding location, the efficiencies of the proposed antenna have been improved by 4.1 and 6.3 dB, respectively, for the left-hand and right-hand scenarios.

Considering the detection resolution and the limited borehole size, the BHR antenna should be both wideband and compact. In this article, a compact nonsymmetric wideband dipole (NSWD) antenna is proposed. One arm of the NSWD antenna consists of several patches with different lengths, and the other one is a hollow metal tube. The combination of patches which are resistively loaded at the ends is used for increasing antenna bandwidth and frequency reconstruction. In addition, a three-section binomial matching transformer is designed for impedances match between antenna ( 120 Ω) and coaxial cable ( 50 Ω). Matching transformer and other radar system devices are housed in the hollow metal tube, which makes the BHR system much compact. The central frequency of the antenna is set to 86 MHz for long-range detection. The proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. The measurement results show that the proposed antenna has the advantages of wide bandwidth (~41.8% from 68 to 104 MHz) and high radiation efficiency (~65%).

To show the proposed concept, the excitation and flexibility of odd (n ε [-1, -3]) and even (n ε [-2, -4]) HSHs based on the analysis of a Brillouin diagram along with the effect of unit-cell geometrical structures of substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) for different propagating media are investigated.

By integrating the VO2 film into a uniplanar compact photonic-bandgap (UC-PBG) structure, a frequency-reconfigurable metasurface (FRMS) structure with frequency ratio of 1.78 is constructed accordingly. Moreover, the active VO2-based FRMS is used as radiation element to design a high-gain millimeter-wave frequency-reconfigurable metasurface antenna (FRMSA), which is excited by a stepped waveguide through two slots of different lengths. In order to electrically activate the VO2 films of the antenna, a simple dc bias co-planarly localized with the FRMS is well designed. Benefiting from the convenient connection of the UC-PBG, only simple connection with two sides of the antenna is required for the dc bias, thus causing little impact on radiation due to far from the radiation region. One prototype is fabricated and measured for demonstration. When the VO2 film is activated to insulating state, the measured results show that the proposed FRMSA can operate in 23.25-24.3 GHz with the maximum gain of ~8.7 dBi, while it can work in 37-39.8 GHz with a peak gain of ~7.6 dBi when driven to metallic state.

It is first explicitly demonstrated that existing design approaches heavily rely on the adjustment of the design stack-up, namely, the substrate height and relative permittivity, to the desired operating frequency. An approach is then proposed for decoupling the performance from the substrate parameters. The proposed approach provides increased design flexibility, resulting in performance improvement. Insight on the operating principle is provided resorting to equivalent circuit models. Subsequently, the benefits of the angularly stable reflection polarizer are demonstrated by a practical example involving a multiple beam antenna implemented using materials and processes compatible with satellite missions.

Two orthogonally oriented gaps are used to shrink the dimension of the cylindrical open-ended SIW cavity.

One dual-band antenna is realized by a composite structure that supports two independent modes: they are the half-circular loop mode for the lower band and the half quasi TE11(1/2) mode for the upper band. The other dual-band antenna is an aperture-shared structure: the lower band is related to the miniaturized cylindrical open-ended SIW cavity which works at the quasi TE11(1/2) mode; the upper band is characterized by suspending a concentric slot-loaded circular patch which works at the TM11 patch mode over the empty space of the miniaturized cylindrical open-ended SIW cavity. All modes involved in the two dual-band antennas, the half-circular loop mode, the half quasi TE11(1/2) mode, the quasi TE11(1/2) mode, and TM11 mode, are featured by broadside radiation.

This design is realized through the optimally distributed and balanced multiport feeding of the cavity-backed patch antenna element that provides the desired (unique) loading conditions for the main and auxiliary PA branches and tailored power combining. A novelty and advantage of this feeding solution is that each pair of feeding points forms a virtual common feeding center of the radiating element; as a result, the radiation pattern remains power invariant when the port excitations change. A joint optimization of the integrated antenna-DPA transmitter is carried out to enhance the overall performance and maximize the bandwidth. This optimization is demonstrated through an example design for the sub-6 GHz telecommunication applications that target high power efficiency (>50%) at the 6 dB backed-off power levels and require RF-filtering in a compact integrated design. The latter challenge leads to a nonconventional implementation, which generally does not require the filter to be inserted between the antenna and the final output stage of the PA, and can be embedded in the topology with complex-valued source/load impedance values.

A wideband property is achieved by utilizing TM11 and TM21 mode, as well as the orthogonal mode of TM11. The Γ-shaped feed is employed to stimulate the TM21 mode. Besides, due to the parasitic radiation from the face-to-face Γ-shaped feeds with opposite phase, the radiation peak of the circular patch under TM21 mode is along the broadside direction, which is different from the original radiation mechanism of TM21 mode. By loading shorting pins in the middle area of circular patch, the polarization orthogonal mode of the fundamental mode (TM11) is excited properly, which contributed to bandwidth enhancement. Cooperated with the quadrature phase feed network, a wideband circular patch antenna with unidirectional radiation and circular polarization properties is designed, fabricated, and measured.

The near-field data is post-processed to extract the relative phase difference that exists due to the unsynchronized rotations of the electric field vectors in a plane parallel to the antenna aperture. The phase delay is compensated with a thin time-synchronizing metasurface (TSM) that has a 2-D array of time-delay cells. The method is demonstrated with a prototype made of a two-port patch antenna, which is fed through a hybrid junction, and a TSM that is placed at one wavelength spacing above the patch.

This resonator and feeder define the eight-port DRA, which, can offer linear polarization (LP), right-handed circular polarization (RHCP), or left-handed circular polarization (LHCP).

This may become prohibitive for very large arrays and arrays with limited computing resources. Alternatively, self-holography (SH) solves the gains using the correlations between a reference signal and the antenna signals, resulting in a linear scaling with P. The drawback of SH is that it assumes that the reference signal is free of interference. In reality, this will rarely be the case, and the presence of interference will reduce the accuracy of the gain estimates. In this article, we analyze the mathematical model underlying SH, and we extract an analytical expression for the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) that can be used to relate the accuracy of the gain estimates to the level of interference in the reference signal. We conclude this article by applying SH to three practical examples that are representative of the aforementioned extreme calibration scenarios. The practical results are in line with our theoretical findings, which confirms that we have successfully derived accurate assessment criteria.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060070","National Research Foundation of South Africa(grant numbers:75322); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9369030","Antenna array;aperture array;beamforming;calibration;phased array","Calibration;Antenna measurements;Antenna arrays;Arrays;Phased arrays;Voltage measurement;Receiving antennas","","3","","25","IEEE","3 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This uncertainty in the element patterns results in beamforming errors, which can be particularly problematic for applications requiring precise pattern control. A new approach is reported to compensate for the mutual coupling of single-mode radiators using only the measured S-parameters and received signal from several far-field sources. The technique relies on the fact that dominant mode scattering from each antenna can be removed by terminating it with the proper impedance. Optimized beamforming weights are derived that compensate for mutual coupling. It is shown that implementing these optimized weights is equivalent to terminating all elements with a “virtual” impedance that cancels scattering from neighboring antenna elements (i.e., mutual coupling). Simulations of perfectly uniform and nonuniform linear dipole arrays show that compensating for mutual coupling using the proposed technique reduces the variation of the embedded element patterns by an order of magnitude compared to more conventional techniques. The proposed approach could be useful for a wide variety of antenna arrays and may even lend itself to self-calibration in the field using signals of opportunity.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362149","Active electronic scanned array (AESA);antenna array;calibration;digital beamforming;mutual coupling;virtual impedance","Impedance;Antenna arrays;Mutual coupling;Scattering;Dipole antennas;Array signal processing;Antenna radiation patterns","","7","","26","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we analyze azimuthally invariant cascaded sheet metasurfaces placed in a cylindrical waveguide excited by TM0n modes. The metasurface comprises multiple radially varying electric admittance sheets separated by dielectric spacers. We derive the modal representation of a single inhomogeneous, electric sheet admittance using two approaches: a conventional numerical integration approach and a discrete Hankel transform (DHT) approach. We show that the DHT approach is more efficient. Subsequently, the modal matrices of cascaded sheet metasurfaces are derived using the DHT. Finally, we propose an optimization-based procedure to synthesize transparent metasurface-based mode converters. The mode converters transform a set of incident modes on one side to another set of desired modes on the opposite side of the metasurface.

Compared with traditional elements, the subgridding elements have a more complex distribution of edges and nodes. Therefore, an efficient subgridding scheme is given to form the element matrix for each subgridding element. Such system matrices assembled by all element matrices are symmetric. The subgridding FETD (S-FETD) is then further developed into the subgridding unconditionally stable FETD (SUS-FETD) by filtering spatial unstable modes.

As the geological medium is spatially rough, the late-time tail phenomenon can be explained as a multiscale electromagnetic anomalous diffusion, which is a union of fractional subdiffusion and regular diffusion. The roughness parameter  $\beta $  and weighting parameter  $W$  are introduced into the generalized electrical conductivity to indicate the roughness level and ratio. The characteristics and superiority of the improved generalized electrical conductivity are analyzed in the time domain. A 3-D modeling method is proposed based on the fractional finite-difference time-domain method. The introduced Caputo fractional derivative in the time domain is calculated by the Alikhanov superconvergent approximation method, so that the stability of the solution is improved. Several half-space models are designed to verify the 3-D modeling efficiency. It turns out that the improved generalized electrical conductivity can model the electromagnetic late-time tail efficiently, which is characterized by responses that coincide with the classical attenuation law at earlier times and the departure at later times. Moreover, this approach is also applied to anomalous models with 3-D bodies; the results indicate that the proposed method can recognize 3-D anomalous bodies efficiently.

Beginning with Maxwell's equations, MFAM's Helmholtz equation could be obtained by the known transverse- k vectors of plane waves. Through a series of complicated manipulations applied to the derivation of Helmholtz equations, we can attain ordinary differential equation of electric fields that merely exist in a certain direction and then compute four different eigenvalues in different MFAM regions. Under 3-D cases, meanwhile, concrete expressions of other fields can be obtained by given electric fields in the fixed direction. The ETC of electromagnetic fields in the tangential continuity is mainly considered in the TMM, and hence, the transferring matrix of electromagnetic field between MFAM regions can be constructed to achieve reflection and transmission coefficients. With various plane-wave modes such as transverse electromagnetic (TEM), transverse electric (TE), and transverse magnetic (TM) field modes, respectively, computational results of MFAM models are solved and adopted to compare with those from the commercial software of COMSOL. Finally, to discuss deeply and efficiently achieve color images, we acquire those reflection and transmission coefficients of more complicated fully anisotropic materials under the different transverse- k vectors.

The comparison shows that the ray tracer is capable of reproducing measured channels with reasonable accuracy, given proper permittivity values set for major building walls. The accuracy, however, depends on the types of point clouds we input to the ray tracer: 1) raw point cloud from laser scanning measurements of the cellular site; 2) flattened point cloud where structural details of the environments are all lost like what we find in publicly available digital maps; and 3) processed point cloud where missing sections are complemented, flat and rough sections of surfaces are identified and wedges are detected. For condensed parameters of channels such as path loss, delay, and angular spreads, ray tracing with the processed and raw point clouds shows equally good accuracy. In contrast, the ray tracing with the processed point cloud shows clear advantage of accuracy over that with the raw point cloud when simulating physical propagation paths. The raw point cloud produces many spurious paths that do not exist in measurements, whereas the processed point cloud reproduces multipath richness in form of many weak diffracted paths that are found in measurements and cannot be reproduced by diffuse scattering. Ray tracing with the flattened point cloud is in least agreement with measurements. Still, first-order specular reflections from large smooth walls are reproduced well by ray tracer with any of the tested point clouds. We thereby demonstrate the superiority of using the processed point cloud as inputs to ray tracer to obtain multipath channels with the highest fidelity to measurements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3050482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9325887","Diffraction;point cloud;ray tracing","Three-dimensional displays;Measurement by laser beam;Radio propagation;Laser modes;Uncertainty;Surface treatment;Ray tracing","","27","","29","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous literature demonstrates the limitations of the MPS technique, usable only when the signal frequency is low (typically below 5 GHz for radio-wave propagation in the troposphere). In this article, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the MPS technique depends not only on the signal frequency but also on the outer scale length ( Los) of the turbulent eddy. For example, when Los is on the order of tens of meters (e.g., in most terrestrial communication links), the MPS method is indeed unusable at high frequencies, but, when Los is on the order of hundreds of meters (e.g., in air-ground and satellite links), the method can be used even at millimeter-wave frequencies. Next, a correlated phase screen (CPS) implementation within the PWE is introduces, which avoids the condition of statistical noncorrelation of the phase screens in the MPS technique, and as such, it can be used for any signal frequency. Finally, an ad hoc error metric is provided, allowing for the selection of the appropriate phase screen model based on the signal frequency, turbulence outer scale length, and the electromagnetic (EM) link distance. The simulated signal log-amplitude variances as a function of range at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies using the CPS method are reported here for the first time and are shown to be in excellent agreement with the analytically obtained values.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3048532","MIT Lincoln Lab-oratory(grant numbers:7000300729); Office of Naval Research (ONR)(grant numbers:N00014-16-1-2989); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9351735","Correlated phase screen (CPS);log-amplitude variance;multiple phase screen (MPS);parabolic wave equation (PWE);scintillation;troposphere;turbulence","Refractive index;Mathematical model;Ducts;Computational modeling;Atmospheric waves;Atmospheric modeling;Terrestrial atmosphere","","10","","24","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, although many popular propagation models (PMs) are available for reference, their analysis and validation in ultrarugged terrain areas (uRTAs) are still underexplored. This article aims to implement an uRTA PM (uRTAPM), which consists of two modes, i.e., the point-to-point (uRTAPM-P2P) and the point-to-area (uRTAPM-P2A) modes, to meet the requirements of practical applications. First, we consider the digital elevation model (DEM) data sets and three types of propagation, i.e., line of sight (LOS), non-LOS (NLOS), and multiobstacle propagation. Second, we propose a cone multipath model to simulate the NLOS diffraction behavior caused by mountains. Third, we utilize a triangulated irregular network (TIN) to finely divide the terrestrial surface of uRTAs. Finally, based on numerical calculations, compared with the existing commonly used PMs, the uRTAPM is found to reveal more details about the propagation loss (PL) caused by the terrain in uRTAs. The measurements demonstrate that the mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and standard deviation (SD) between the uRTAPM predicted values and the actual measured values are lower than those of other methods.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3045508","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61841113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9305938","Propagation loss (PL) prediction;propagation model (PM);ultrarugged terrain areas;wireless communication","Predictive models;Wireless communication;Diffraction;Data models;Tin;Propagation losses;Meters","","8","","45","IEEE","23 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method is frequently described in the literature and yields accurate results. In this article, it is shown that this method can be used to approximate the transmission line reflection coefficient while including high-frequency effects. It is, hence, applicable to smaller wave lengths than the classical transmission line theory. Two general problems are considered: 1) the infinite wire with a lumped impedance above ground and 2) the semi-infinite wire with an arbitrary port configuration above ground. For both configurations, the reflection coefficient is approximated using the induced EMF method. An important intermediate step is to find exact equations that relate the input impedance and the reflection coefficient. The results are compared to an exact solution and an iterative one, which is used in recent publications. It is shown that the induced EMF method is a good alternative to the iterative method. The novelty of this article is the utilization of the induced EMF method for the analytic approximation of the transmission line reflection coefficient and linking the input impedance and the reflection coefficient.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060091","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362185","Antenna input impedance;reflection coefficient;transmission lines;transmission line discontinuities","Wires;Impedance;Power transmission lines;Iterative methods;Antennas;Admittance;Transmission line antennas","","1","","14","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a new finite range integral representation of the SI is formulated based on the exact image theory. To derive the new representation, a finite range integral expression of the exact image current is first derived. The radiated field by the exact image current is expressed in terms of a double integral in the complex domain where the exact image current flows. One of the two integrals is a semiinfinite line integral along the current path. This integral is deformed into a more convenient form as the exact image representation for the impedance plane. To convert the line source in the complex domain into a line source in the real domain, the path-deformation technique is again applied. The final line source consists of three line segments along which the exact image current flows vertically from the image source point to ±∞. In addition to the line source, a lateral wave component is also obtained. The impedance exact image representation can be evaluated as a closed-form expression in terms of an incomplete cylindrical function. Thus, the SI can be represented as the finite range integral of the incomplete cylindrical function. To efficiently evaluate the proposed integral, a complete uniform asymptotic expansion is formulated. All the proposed formulations are numerically verified, including, in some cases, near-Earth propagation, and their behaviors are investigated. Also, the electric field is computed for a vertical and horizontal infinitesimal dipole and compared by the exact Sommerfeld and known approximate formulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060042","INHA University Research Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364865","Complete asymptotic;dielectric half-space;exact image;Sommerfeld integral (SI)","Dielectrics;Integral equations;Permittivity;Impedance;Image representation;Antennas;Method of moments","","8","","26","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This allows the smallest theoretical error of the SBR method, adaptive ray spawning procedures, and a unique analysis of the effect of ray cone sizes on the accuracy of the method. For the conventional uniform angular distribution of rays, a less general and versatile but more expeditious approach, we derive an analytical expression for the optimal choice of cone angle to again maximize the overall accuracy of the SBR computation. Both approaches are derived using icosahedral ray spawning geometry and adjacent ray sets, which are also used for our double counted rays identification and removal technique that avoids complicated ray path searches.

Then, it is extended to 3-D wedges for arbitrary polarizations and incident/scattered directions by transforming ray-fixed to edge-fixed coordinate systems. The total field predicted using the proposed heuristic diffraction coefficient is continuous for arbitrary angle 3-D dielectric wedges, including interior wedges, and is close to the geometrical optics field far from the shadow boundaries.

Either the single-level or multilevel implementation can be applied, and in the single-level implementation, a single pseudo-inverse matrix can be used to synthesize plane waves propagating various incident directions. In addition to the 3-D formulation, the single-cut variation of the method (SC-PWS) is also presented for the 2-D RCS prediction.

In particular, the study focuses on the case of a planar surface magnetic current which is to be reconstructed from near-field observed over a bounded rectangular aperture parallel to the source domain. Resolution formulas are well known for far-field or Fresnel-zone configurations, and also for near-field cases, when data are full-view or a measurement aperture is an unbounded plane. For the case of bounded near-field observations, the resolution estimations mainly rely on some asymptotic arguments in order to mimic far-field reasoning. Here, the plan is to improve these results and to work out a resolution estimation that precisely captures the spatially varying behavior entailed by the near-field and aspect-limited configuration. To this end, the pertinent radiation operator is inverted by an adjoint inversion scheme (a back-propagation-like method) and the corresponding point-spread function is analytically estimated. Numerical examples show that the derived resolution estimation clearly points out the role of the geometrical parameters of the configuration and it is more accurate than other literature results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060030","Italian Ministry of University and Research through the PON initiative under the project Leonardo 4.0; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362215","Inverse problems;inverse source;radar imaging;and resolution","Estimation;Spatial resolution;Indexes;Surface reconstruction;Signal to noise ratio;Signal resolution;Magnetic domains","","32","","41","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, we apply this method to determine the frequency stationarity regions (FSRs) of channel measurements in a sub-6-GHz frequency band (2-4 GHz) and two mmWave frequency bands (14-16 GHz and 28-30 GHz). Frequency nonstationary (FnS) properties are found from all of the three bands. A novel FnS channel model is then proposed to model wireless channels in all frequency bands. We first split a FnS channel into a few frequency stationary (FS) subband channels and model them one by one, which are finally combined as an FnS channel model considering the cluster evolution in the frequency domain and the frequency consistency of subband channels.

Moreover, no efficient imaging algorithm is now available for these MIMO arc array setups. This article proposes a modified Omega-K algorithm for near-field azimuth image reconstruction based on the geometry transformation from the single-frequency MIMO arc array to the equivalent MIMO linear array. Note that this geometry transformation relies on the calculation of the phase difference and the definition of the corresponding compensation function. Compared with the single-input–single-output (SISO) arc scan requiring more elements, simulations with good agreement were performed to validate the azimuth image reconstructions of single/multiple targets. Although the computing efficiency of the proposed algorithm for MIMO arc array is lower than that of the traditional Omega-K algorithm for the SISO arc scan, it still has an obvious advantage relative to the traditional backprojection (BP) algorithm that is always taken as the gold standard. Furthermore, three realistic imaging geometries, including the metal strips at different radii, the tilted metal plate, and the human body torso cross section, were simulated to test the fidelity of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Proof-of-principle experiments were also carried out based on an MIMO arc array with the help of one arc scanner.

One of the classic methodologies to address this inverse problem is the Born iterative method (BIM), which divides the nonlinear problem into two linear subproblems: a forward and an inverse one. Several methods can be coupled within this framework to solve the inverse subproblem. This work proposes a formulation for the inverse subproblem in terms of a quadratic programming one, which allows the application of an exact methodology with an adequate mechanism to enforce a particular type of a priori information: the limits of the range of possible contrast values of the objects. This is one of the main contributions of this article and an adaption of the formulation to the use of multiple frequencies and regularization functions. The methodology was able to reconstruct images with few iterations. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology in different scenarios considering synthesized geometries and breast phantoms. Mean error per pixel of less than 0.25% for synthesized geometries and 4.6% for breast phantoms (mean value of 0.74% among the experiments) were obtained for the approximations of the scattered field data and the contrast map, in addition to adequately reconstructing objects with different positions, geometries, and contrasts. The comparison between the original BIM and the proposed method with only Tikhonov regularization and no enforcement of prior information showed similar performance. On the other hand, the proposed method with the enforcement of prior information has presented a better performance than the original BIM in 14 of 19 experiments related to the synthesized geometries. The ability to enforce a priori information in the proposed method on the lower and upper bounds of the contrast was responsible for reducing the error by 25%, on average, with respect to the same obtained in the experiments when this information was not considered. In addition, the results also suggested that the enforcement of this information was able to speed up the convergence of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060092","Brazilian Agency CAPES; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362200","Born iterative method;inverse scattering;microwave imaging;quadratic programming (QP)","Imaging;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave imaging;Iterative methods;Inverse problems;Image reconstruction;Geometry","","24","","50","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article demonstrates the applicability of the so-called Langley method to infer EIRP and atmospheric attenuation simultaneously from ground-based power measurements, with no need for ancillary measurements. It is shown that the proposed method gives results similar to more traditional methods, without prior information on atmospheric attenuation.

For a circular source geometry, accurate closed-form evaluations of the PSF allow to establish its angular variant behavior for limited observation angular domains. This leads to introducing a numerical procedure, based on the widths of the PSF main lobes, able to define an optimal source discretization, that is, the spacing of the array elements whose radiated field has the same number of degrees of freedom of the continuous conformal source. A nonuniform spacing is derived and the performances of the corresponding conformal arrays are compared with the uniform case, the number of elements being equal.

Their role is to improve the computational efficiency of the procedures that normally entail large numbers of expensive full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations, e.g., parametric optimization or uncertainty quantification. Recently introduced performance-driven modeling methods, such as the nested kriging framework, alleviate some of the common difficulties pertinent to conventional modeling methods. These include the curse of dimensionality but also the need for rendering models to be valid for broad ranges of antenna parameters and operating conditions, as dictated by the design utility of the surrogates. The keystone of performance-driven methods is an appropriate confinement of the model domain so that the training data are only acquired in the regions containing high-quality designs. Identification of such regions is realized using a set of so-called reference designs preoptimized for selected ensembles of performance requirements. The CPU cost of generating the reference points may be considerable and compromise the savings obtained by operating in a constrained domain. In this article, a technique for automated, reliable and low-cost acquisition of the reference designs is proposed. Our methodology involves inverse sensitivities, iterative correction procedures, and accelerated feature-based gradient search with sparse Jacobian updates. It is validated using three microstrip antenna examples and demonstrated as an efficient tool for lowering the cost of building surrogate models within the nested kriging framework. The intended use of our approach is expedited construction of database designs for constrained modeling frameworks, construction of inverse surrogates, as well as procedures for rapid redesign and dimension scaling of antenna structures.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3074632","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:217771); Narodowe Centrum Nauki(grant numbers:2020/37/B/ST7/01448); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9416865","Antenna design;design optimization;electromagnetic (EM)-driven design;performance-driven modeling;surrogate modeling","Antennas;Optimization;Computational modeling;Databases;Reliability;Sensitivity;Bandwidth","","15","","59","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finally, the radiation pattern of the AUT can be obtained by evaluating the corresponding radiation integrals. Unlike previous work, the use of amplitude-only data avoids the need of a phase reference, paving the way to the diagnosis and characterization of antennas under operational conditions. This fact, together with the handheld capabilities, makes the system very convenient for measurements of already deployed and onboard antennas. Moreover, these amplitude-only acquisitions also simplify the required hardware. The system has been validated through measurements in a wide frequency range from  $Ka$ -band up to 300 GHz. Despite that one cannot expect the same degree of accuracy that can be achieved under laboratory conditions (including an anechoic environment and highly accurate positioners), the system shows excellent capabilities to detect malfunctions, such as wrong amplitude/phase distributions, as well as a fair estimation of the far field.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060082","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades of Spain/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)(grant numbers:RTI2018-095825-B-I00); Gobierno del Principado de Asturias(grant numbers:GRUPIN-IDI-2018-000191); Ministerio de Educación y Formación Profesional of Spain(grant numbers:FPU15/06431); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362206","Amplitude-only;antenna diagnosis;antenna measurements;equivalent currents;freehand;millimeter-wave (mm-wave) antenna;phaseless;power-meter;sources reconstruction method","Antenna measurements;Antennas;Probes;Phase measurement;Current distribution;Hardware;Frequency measurement","","16","","35","CCBY","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To power up a planar receiver coil in any orientation, 3-D rotating H-field is required. Using the transmitter coil antennas with amplitude-modulated current excitations, 3-D polarization of H-field is achieved. The power transfer efficiency depends on the polarization of the H-field and varies with receiver inclination. This is applicable for a spherically polarized H-field which is otherwise expected to provide uniform induced voltage in the receiver in any orientation. To completely mitigate the misalignment problem, mathematical analysis of H-field forming is presented followed by optimization of the 3-D polarization. This evolves in understanding the effect of various 3-D H-field polarizations on the induced voltage and results in an optimum ellipsoidal polarization achieving performance that is invariant to the receiver orientation. The results are compared for various 3-D polarizations and the best performance is shown by the proposed solution. The analytically obtained results are validated through simulations and experimental studies. The results thus obtained proved the potential of the proposed optimized 3-D H-field polarization in WPT systems where a free-orientation of the receiver is necessary.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060140","Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science and Technology, Government of India(grant numbers:ECR/2018/000343); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362237","3-D polarization;angular misalignment;coil antenna;magnetic coupling;wireless power transfer (WPT)","Three-dimensional displays;Antennas;Two dimensional displays;Couplings;Wireless power transfer;Wireless communication;Shape","","11","","24","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique can efficiently result in profile heights of the order of one wavelength, making it very desirable for mmWave applications. The reflector can be fabricated using computer numerical control (CNC) machining and 3-D printing.

The energy bounding effects of a water layer are initially studied for choosing the suitable thickness of the water walls. EHmn modes are excited and can propagate along the water waveguide. The E-field and H-field distributions of the EHmn modes are similar to the TE and TM modes excited inside a metallic rectangular waveguide. Propagation constants of the EHmn modes have been extracted from simulation results, and it is found that a leaky wave can be excited. Measured results show that the proposed water horn antenna has an impedance bandwidth ( |S11| <; -10 dB) from 2.5 to 5.2 GHz (70.1% fractional bandwidth) for the H-plane horn state and from 2.6 to 5.7 GHz (74.7% fractional bandwidth) for the leaky-wave state. The proposed antenna achieves a maximum gain of 11.8 dBi for the H-plane horn and 7.7 dBi for leaky-wave state. The proposed water horn antenna has the advantages of reconfigurability and transparency, which may be potentially useful in many wireless communication applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3064036","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771242); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9376634","Horn antenna;reconfigurable antenna;water antenna;water waveguide","Horn antennas;Rectangular waveguides;Antenna radiation patterns;Optical waveguides;Antennas;Leaky wave antennas;Waveguide transitions","","24","","36","IEEE","11 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve an enhanced beamwidth from the heart-shaped pattern, the complementary sources are cascaded to form an array. In particular, the slots are etched alternately on both sides of the central axis to achieve an in-phase excitation, while the monopoles are uniformly loaded with an alternate antiphase excitation.

Next, the in-body antenna gain was deembedded from the wireless channel, and the in-to-out body propagation loss was obtained as the difference between measured unobstructed line-of-sight path losses and in-to-out-body path losses. The measurements showed a body propagation loss of (mean ± standard deviation) 30.8 ± 4.1 dB, 44.5 ± 4.8 dB, and 54.2 ± 4.7 dB for cows at 433, 868, and 1400 MHz, respectively.

The launcher is designed by synthesizing a finite zeroth-order, first kind Hankel aperture distribution, polarized along a fixed polarization unit vector. The field radiated by such an aperture distribution is derived by following an approximate model based on the geometric theory of diffraction, thus allowing to highlight the relevant wave constituents involved in transverse Bessel beam generation, also including the effect of aperture truncation on the radiated beam. Moreover, the theoretical analysis has been profitably applied to the design of a circular-polarized planar transverse Bessel beam launcher by means of a slotted radial waveguide. A prototype of right-handed circular polarized (RHCP) transverse Bessel beam launcher has then been fabricated at f = 30 GHz. The measured transverse electric field component shows a satisfactory agreement with full-wave numerical simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362254","Bessel beams;circular polarization;near-field focusing;nondiffractive beams;radial line slot array (RLSA)","Apertures;Current distribution;Diffraction;Prototypes;Magnetic domains;Fabrication;Standards","","32","","35","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An analytical formulation for obtaining the required electric surface admittance and magnetic surface impedance is presented. The proposed unit cell consists of a pair of split-rin resonators in the top layer and a metal capacitor in the bottom layer of the same substrate. The geometries are properly designed to provide the required electric surface admittance and magnetic surface impedance for maximum scattering reduction at the operational frequency of 4 GHz. The designed HMS is optimized to realize the required electric surface admittance and magnetic surface impedance for remarkable cloaking purposes. Scattering-cross section (SCS) of uncloaked and cloaked conducting cylinders is obtained with CST Microwave Studio simulation which matches the analytical results. The results show robust scattering reduction with considerable bandwidth for the covered cylinder by the HMS. Furthermore, the obtained results with HMS are compared with the results presented in the literature for cloaking with ordinary metasurface. This comparison emphasizes a much better cloaking performance of the HMS. Considerable cloaking obtained in this communication can be applied for invisibility purposes, sensing applications, antenna isolation, radiation blockage reduction in antennas, etc.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9366398","Huygens’ metasurface (HMS);invisibility;mantle cloaking;radar cross section;scattering","Scattering;Metasurfaces;Impedance;Surface impedance;Admittance;Surface waves;Metamaterials","","16","","33","IEEE","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Various methods are used for the forward solver in the DBIM to simulate wave propagation and scattering. In this communication, a new matrix building technique exploiting the basis functions of the finite element method (FEM) is used to create the inverse-problem matrix in a 2-D DBIM algorithm. The proposed approach provides great efficiency as the entries of this matrix are readily calculated from already precomputed matrices in the FEM procedure without the need for interpolation to calculate the field. The FEM-based DBIM is validated with both simulated data and experimental data from a microwave tomography (MWT) system. Results confirm that the proposed FEM implementation can be an efficient and accurate forward solver for this MWT system.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044806","Agencia Estatal de Investigación (AEI), Spain/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER), European Union(grant numbers:TEC2016-76070-C3-1-R (ADDMATE)); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the Jose Castillejo Research Mobility Programme(grant numbers:CAS18/00097); Innovate UK(grant numbers:103920); U.K.’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/R013918/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9301203","Distorted Born iterative method (DBIM);electromagnetic (EM) inverse scattering problem;finite element method (FEM);microwave imaging (MWI);microwave tomography (MWT)","Finite element analysis;Imaging;Inverse problems;Two dimensional displays;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave imaging;Linear systems","","7","","28","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
