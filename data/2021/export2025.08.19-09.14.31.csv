One of such strategies is given by in-band full-duplex (IBFD) systems, also called simultaneously transmit and receive (STAR) systems, that are considered because spectrum efficiency is not maximized with the current practice of half-duplex communication, where a node either transmits or receives a signal in a single channel. In fact, all currently deployed wireless networks require two separate channels to achieve bi-directionality: Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) are the two most commonly-used techniques. This channel separation prevents the self-interference that has been seen as an insurmountable technical problem. Promoted by the popularity of small cell wireless systems, recent works have provided experimental evidence and methodologies for IBFD systems, where a node transmits and receives signals at the same time and on the same frequency band [1], [2]. IBFD systems not only increase spectral efficiency, but also minimize overhead and timing constraints. This increases throughput and allows for the possibility of real-time sensing of spectrum occupancy for cognitive devices [3]. Even though IBFD systems have their primary application for bidirectional communication topology (where there are two data flows: terminal A sends data to terminal B, and terminal B sends data to terminal A), a different body of recent works has focused on IBFD in other settings including relay, base-station and multi-hop topologies [4]–[7].","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3118828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9591205","","","","9","","36","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed feeding structure can reduce the port-to-port coupling strength and produce a very high isolation. By replacing the crossed radiation slots with two pairs of parallel radiation slots, enhanced radiation gain is achieved. To tackle the narrow bandwidth for the single-mode operation, two orthogonal resonant-iris modes produced by the two feeding slots are introduced to design a dual-mode wideband IBFD antenna.

The proposed array is comprised of tightly coupled dipoles with integrated coupled-Marchand baluns. To improve the uniformity of fields distributed on the array, the center-feeding dipole is used in this design instead of the conventional edge-feeding one at first. Then, the outer conductors of the feed are composed of a group of shorted vias with the proper number and position. Based on these methods, the output balance of the balun is significantly improved, resulting in high isolation between ports with different polarization modes. Furthermore, this feed has a natural ability to suppress the D-plane common mode resonance. The capacitive metallic annular plate over adjacent radiating elements and the thick aluminum plate with an air cavity placed under the array are employed together to suppress the in-band coupled-loop modes. The infinite array simulation indicates that the array can achieve transmit (Tx)/receive (Rx) isolation more than 48 dB at broadside. Isolation better than 32 and 30 dB can be achieved when scanning to 45° in E-/H-planes and 60° in E-plane, respectively. The cross-polarization level is below −54 dB at broadside and remains below −29 dB when scanning to 60° in E-plane as well as 45° in H-plane.

This article discusses the concept development and design progression of the circular mode phasing technique applied to omnidirectional IBFD antenna arrays. The theoretical fundamentals are presented along with simulation results and then validated through the discussion of two prototype antennas, which were measured to provide up to 60 dB of isolation over 2.4–2.5 GHz, which is the highest reported for this SIC method.

When compared to similar IBFD antenna systems, the proposed configuration provides a higher isolation BW (10%) and higher gain (7.8 dBi) whilst adopting a simple feeding network. Also, by using the proposed feeding circuit, the manufactured antenna does not require any external cables and couplers. This simplifies the structure and reduces the number of cable connections. This allows for other analog-based self-interference reduction schemes for further improvements in the transmit and receive data link. In addition, the proposed antenna design was extended to a  $4 \times 1$  array. These dual-differential IBFD antenna systems are a good alternative to more conventional FD designs which typically require external coupler-based feeding. In addition, the operating BWs and isolation values offered by these S-band systems can support new data link possibilities for beam steering and future IBFD wireless networks by low-cost antenna and feeding circuit integration.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3098566","U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/P009670/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9496252","Double-differential antenna;dual-polarization;full duplex;isolation;simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR)","Antenna feeds;Broadband antennas;Slot antennas;Receiving antennas;Couplers;Antenna arrays;Transmitting antennas","","29","","28","Crown","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sensitivity of the BC-BFN to alignment imperfections is studied and it is found to be robust to this kind of error.

The antenna is composed of two parts, i.e., the dual-polarized planar-array feed and the Cassegrain reflectarray with a small focal-length to diameter ratio ( $F/D)$ . The dual-polarized planar array feed is appressed behind the main-reflectarray, and the  $F/D$  is reduced to 0.2 to realize the integration and the low-profile property. For the array feed, high isolation is achieved through the orthogonal-mode isolation and the differential signal cancellation. Its radiation pattern is also manipulated to fit the reflectarray considering the taper and spillover efficiency. For the reflectarray, the rotational symmetry configuration and the dual-layer-patch cell are applied to suit the dual-polarization operation and the large incident angle, respectively. The measured operation band, where the gain variation is within 1 dB, is 93.4–95.6 GHz.

The hardware that separates the transmit signal reflected off the antenna from a same-frequency signal received by that antenna performs this separation purely in the analog domain without the need for a control circuit or any other digital-domain hardware. The authors know of no other antenna interface that distinguishes the reflected transmit signal from a same-frequency receive signal in the analog domain. This innovative antenna interface has been used to demonstrate single-antenna in-band full-duplex capability with better than 30 dB of analog transmit/receive isolation nearly everywhere between 1 and 18 GHz.

Different profile modulations are studied for suppressing the open stopband and the  $n = -2$  space harmonic. If the slot profile is designed to have the impedance matched at the broadside frequency, the leaky-wave antenna has the open stopband suppressed and allows continuous scanning of the main beam through the broadside from the backward endfire to the forward direction. However, it cannot avoid the  $n = -2$  space harmonic, which causes another stopband that limits the scanning range in the forward quadrant. If the slot profile is modulated with a profile such that the aperture illumination excludes the  $n = -2$  space harmonic, the leaky-wave antenna avoids the stopband and grating lobe caused by the harmonic and thereby has the scanning range in the forward quadrant enlarged, but its open stopband cannot be suppressed simultaneously.

The higher-order modes have the feature that they can be excited by the active (source) DRA while unexcitable by means of the feeding network. As a result, the coupled fields in the passive (coupled) DRA are unable to reach the feeding port, leading to a very low mutual coupling level. When the coupled modes in the passive DRA have the same radiation characteristics with the mode that excited in the active DRA, the distortion of radiation patterns can also be avoided. This method is found effective for reducing both the E-plane and H-plane coupling. As no extra decoupling element is needed, the entire antenna system is very simple.

The HEMT is embedded in the antenna element, being directly impedance-matched to HEMT’s drain output, i.e., without using any intermediate and potentially lossy impedance matching network. The proposed co-design approach involves a full-wave analysis of the AiUC passive part (naturally including elements mutual coupling effects) along with the subsequent full-system harmonic balance simulations. Furthermore, we extend the standard definition of the scan element pattern (SEP) to the active SEP (ASEP) that accounts for nonlinear effects of PAs on the AiUC performance. We show that the ASEP is, in general, power-dependent and has a different shape compared with the SEP. The proposed approach has been demonstrated for a  $K$ -band AiUC design example. It was verified through an active waveguide simulator, which is equivalent to the 23.7° H-plane beam-steering case.

Based on the proposed unit cell, a wideband and high-gain multibeam array antenna is developed. First, a Rotman lens is designed by using a substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technology. Then a parallel-fed slot antenna array is connected to the Rotman lens to generate multiple beams. Without using a series-fed slot antenna array, the multibeam array antenna based on Rotman lens can operate within a relatively wide bandwidth (28–32 GHz). Second, a wideband dual-layer Huygens’ metasurface is developed that serves as a superstrate of the multibeam array antenna for increasing the antenna gain further. A wideband and high-gain multibeam array antenna is finally realized, which is comprised of a Rotman lens, a parallel-fed slot antenna array, and a Huygens’ metasurface.

The proposed microwave source consists of an antenna array, in which the two arms of each dipole antenna are connected with a fast-rise time switch and charged by a dc voltage source. Each antenna unit is triggered by the incoming wave radiated from the previous unit and then oscillates and correspondingly produces a new electromagnetic wave to trigger the next one. Both simulations and experiments show that the output waves of multiple antenna units are in phase, and the output power is accordingly enhanced.

In this article, the mutual coupling between antennas of a circular array in an anisotropic plasma over a very low-frequency (VLF: 3–30 kHz) range is investigated. An expansion of the currents into phase modes enables us to develop an efficient method to analyze the mutual coupling between antennas. The  $N$ -coupled integral equations for antennas of an array are first derived with full consideration of the mutual coupling effect. By making use of the phase modes combined with the method of moment (MoM), the  $N$ -coupled integral equations are decomposed into independent ones and solved for each phase mode. Computations and discussions show that the self and mutual impedances of antennas are increased with the geomagnetic field tilt angle. Moreover, the mutual impedance is decreased with the increasing electrical separation, thereby indicating that the mutual coupling effect is weakened as the separation increases. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by comparing the computed results with experiments and simulation using commercial electromagnetics software FEKO.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3076658","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001424,61571389); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9424415","Anisotropic plasma;antenna array;input impedance;mutual coupling effect;very low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic (EM) wave","Antenna arrays;Antennas;Phased arrays;Plasmas;Mutual coupling;Satellite antennas;Transmitting antennas","","9","","34","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two samples of single-layer and double-layer ESSs operating at 3 GHz are designed to demonstrate the double-resonance concept. By utilizing a double-layer structure, a second-order band-stop resonance is produced to achieve a broader bandwidth with high SE in comparison with the single-layer ESS.

Field circuit cosimulation is conducted to estimate the nonlinear performance of the ESS designs. Moreover, the ESS designs are measured in a rectangular waveguide setup.

The metasurface is described in terms of Lorentzian electric and magnetic surface susceptibilities, both tangential and normal to the surface, with parameters (e.g., resonant frequency) that are periodically modulated in both space and time. The unknown scattered fields are expressed in terms of Floquet harmonics, for which the amplitudes can be found by numerically solving a set of linear equations, leading to the total scattered fields. Using existing computational techniques and a commercial full-wave solver, the method is validated using several examples of pure-space and pure-time modulation with different modulation strengths and pumping frequencies. Finally, two cases of space–time modulation (standing wave perturbation and a traveling-wave perturbation) are presented to demonstrate the breaking of Lorentz reciprocity.

The analytical expression of 3-D conformal PML is derived with the complex coordinate stretching technique. Furthermore, to reduce the total degrees of freedom (DoFs) while maintaining accuracy, the hierarchical vector basis functions are chosen to discretize the conformal PML and physical region. Numerical results validate its good absorption performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3084625","Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2020JM-515); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447201","Conformal perfectly matched layer (PML);discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method;hierarchical basis functions","Conductivity;Mathematical model;Time-domain analysis;Ellipsoids;Method of moments;Maxwell equations;Finite element analysis","","8","","32","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A critical mechanism in urban propagation is corner diffraction, which illuminates shadow areas but with low link gain. We present a simple add-on system for corners, comprising a simple scattering dipole or scattering array, which can significantly improve link gain in the shadow region over a wide bandwidth.

To achieve this, we measured the signal power simultaneously received at nine ceiling-mounted access point (AP) locations likely to be used in future indoor DAS deployments while a mobile user imitated making a voice call on a hypothetical user equipment. Key metrics, associated with the performance of multiple antenna systems, such as the cross correlation coefficient (CCC) and channel power imbalance (CPI) are determined. It was found that line-of-sight (LOS) and quasi-LOS (QLOS) links with the APs typically led to higher CCC values than the non-LOS (NLOS) cases. Similarly, LOS and QLOS links typically produced higher CPI values between APs than the NLOS case. To enable the reproduction of our results, we have successfully applied autoregressive moving average and autoregressive integrated moving average modeling to the CCC and CPI time series. The performance improvement that can be achieved using a DAS instead of a single AP was evaluated using three commonly deployed diversity combining schemes, namely, selection combining, equal gain combining, and maximal ratio combining along with three AP selection mechanisms, namely, per-sample random AP selection, one-shot AP selection, and per-sample optimal AP selection.

The reflective properties of indoor materials with different surface roughness and dielectric constants are important to explore diffuse scattering for accurate channel modeling. First and foremost, a terahertz Swissto12 system is adopted to obtain the first ever transmission measurements for a wide choice of indoor material groups, such as wood, plastic, and brick at frequencies from 750 GHz to 1.1 THz using up-conversion (frequency-domain) method. Both the reflection ( $S_{11}$ ,  $S_{22}$ ) and transmission coefficients ( $S_{12}$ ,  $S_{21}$ ) are measured using this novel and noninvasive electromagnetic technique. The inversion method based on Kramers–Kronig (K-K) relations is then applied to convert the calibrated scatter data into intrinsic material properties (i.e., refractive index, permittivity, absorption coefficient). Then, the surface topography of rough material samples is acquired using surface measurement instruments. Further, the optically smooth  $(\sigma _{h} /\lambda \ll 1)$  materials are assorted as most to least rough based on Rayleigh roughness factor.

In this article, we develop a model for the polarization of ionospherically propagated radio waves; the polarization is dependent only upon the strength and direction of the magnetic field at the location where the radio wave exits the ionosphere. This leads to the hemisphere of possible incoming directions of arrival to any particular receiver being divided into three distinct regions.

In the literature, many array calibration algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, which generally requires customized phase setting for individual phase shifters connected to array elements. In this article, a new array calibration method is proposed for phased array operating in beam-steering mode only, that is, phase shifts of elements are only simultaneously set according to the beam-steering directions, and therefore, there is no need for dedicated individual element phase tuning. The proposed method requires a minimum number of complex-signal measurements in principle, which enables fast measurement. Furthermore, it is found that the performance of the proposed method is determined by the beam-steering matrix, whose condition number is mainly ruled by the beam-steering angle interval. The proposed method is numerically simulated and experimentally validated in a millimeter-wave (mmWave) phased-array antenna-in-package (AiP) platform at 28 GHz. The proposed method presents good agreement with the well-known rotating element electric field vector (REV) array calibration method, with an amplitude error and phase error within ±0.5 dB and ±5°, respectively.

Although the spoof SPP can transmit to the two radiator structures from the splitter structure, the wave vectors of the spoof SPP in the splitter structure and radiator structures are mismatched. Thus, the spoof SPP from the splitter structure will not be bounded mode when it propagates at the two radiator structures and will be decoupled by the two radiator structures, thereby realizing a bidirectional endfire radiation pattern.

First, two orthogonal curved dipole pairs are designed via step-by-step investigation of the evolution of traditional crossed dipoles. Then, an antenna with a wide CP working bandwidth and wide ARBWs and HPBWs is developed by enlarging the diameter of the curved arms, replacing the narrow arms with the wide patches and making these patches conformal with the shell surface; this improves the impedance bandwidth (IBW) and further reduces the antenna’s size.

Each band exhibits a dual-polarized radiation, and more importantly, the two bands shared the same radiation aperture. In the millimeter-wave (MM-wave) band, the proposed antenna can generate two-dimensional (2-D) multiple beams with dual-polarization, and the switching range at each plane is about ±20°. The antenna is composed of two kinds of ME-dipole. The MM-wave band uses an ME-dipole feeding through the substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) as the source to excite four horn antennas with inclined inner walls to achieve high-gain 2-D switching with dual-polarization. The lower frequency band combines the four horn antennas to achieve a large dual-polarized ME-dipole antenna. The antenna operating mechanism and the design procedure are illustrated in detail. The measured results show that a −10 dB impedance bandwidth of 33.91% (24–33.91 GHz) and 50.31% (2.35–3.93 GHz) is achieved.

As a distributed multiple inductive-capacitive loading, this MDN employs two groups of parallel shorting posts (vias) on the nonradiating edges of the high-coupled patches with a very-low edge-to-edge distance. This MDN excites two controllable new modified resonant half-modes, TM1/2,1 and TM3/2,0, whose aggregation provides a well-matched broad bandwidth with broadside pattern. Furthermore, a reasonable offset between these two groups of vias helps obtaining a balance between the mutual capacitive and inductive couplings, and then a broadband high isolation across the overlapped bandwidth without using the conventional large isolating structures. A resonator-based equivalent-circuit model including different mutual and cross couplings is proposed and discussed to study the coupling mechanism between the modes and the antennas. Finally, the measurement proves a bandwidth of 9.8% (3.38–3.73 GHz) with an enhanced isolation of over 27 dB. A fair comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches is drawn, and greatly reduced spatial correlation (with envelop correlation coefficient (ECC) of less than 0.06) and over 72% total efficiency (with 25% increase) make the proposed design appropriate for fifth-generation (5G) multi-input–multi-output (MIMO), and the other sensitive bi-element systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3076662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9424435","Array antenna;isolation;multi-input–multi-output (MIMO);mutual coupling;wideband matching","Couplings;Antennas;Broadband antennas;Bandwidth;Integrated circuit modeling;Mutual coupling;Impedance","","33","","24","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While retaining the proven accuracy and convergence rate of FEM, it allows for a reduction in dimensionality of the problem and classifies the modes with respect to their rotational symmetry. Most importantly, it discriminates reliably and unambiguously degenerate modes (no matter how high their order is) with the exact same computed cutoff frequency value.

Second, a solution for a specific case was added for a more accurate categorization to use the correct formula. This improved rotating-element electric-field vector (IREV) is experimentally verified.
