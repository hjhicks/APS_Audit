"A Low-Profile Decoupling Structure for Mutual Coupling Suppression in MIMO Patch Antenna","T. Pei; L. Zhu; J. Wang; W.

To clearly illustrate the operation principle, the phase of the signal transmitted from Patch 1 to Patch 2 has been initially studied and the decoupling condition for two closely spaced patch antennas in H-plane has also been obtained. Afterward, the decoupling element concisely composed of a half-wave microstrip line and a shorting pin is developed. Attributing to the introduction of additional signal path by the new decoupling structure, mutual coupling between two adjacent patches is effectively suppressed. To verify the feasibility of the proposed design scheme, demonstrators of two-element patch antennas with and without decoupling structure are, respectively, implemented and analyzed. Results indicate that compared with the coupled array, the isolation between two patch elements is enhanced from 7 to 18 dB at the center frequency of 3.16 GHz under the edge-to-edge separation of only 0.027  $\lambda _{0}$ . Besides, owing to the single layer layout, the profile of the whole antenna structure is as low as 0.02  $\lambda _{0}$ . Ultimately, the proposed decoupling scheme has been applied to the three-element counterpart, so as to demonstrate and validate its effeteness of isolation enhancement for multielement patch array.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3098565","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau, SAR, under the Science and Technology Development Fund (FDCT)(grant numbers:0095/2019/A2); National Natural Science Foundation of China under General Program(grant numbers:61971475,61571468,61771247); University of Macau under Multiyear Research(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00007-FST,MYRG2018-00073-FST); State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves(grant numbers:K202210); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497755","Decoupling;low profile;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) antenna;patch array","Antenna arrays;Patch antennas;Mutual coupling;Antennas;Couplings;MIMO communication;Transmitting antennas","","114","","20","IEEE","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is found that the cavity mode with purely directional electric field is only affected by the metal post to be placed in parallel to its electric field. Thus, two orthogonal cavity modes TE101 and TE011 can be perturbed by two respective metal posts so as to independently tune the resonant frequencies of these two modes. Electromagnetic energy of the cavity modes can be radiated out through the slots on the top wall of the cavity. In this context, reconfigurable slot antennas with different functionalities, such as single-band, dual-band, dual-mode wideband, the tunable frequency with constant bandwidth, and tunable bandwidth with constant frequency, are thus constituted to demonstrate its attractive design feasibility. The frequency-reconfigurable cavity-back slot antenna with movable metal posts is proposed for the first time. The utilization of the metal posts allows us to achieve a continuous frequency tuning property, while the full-metal structure of the proposed antenna holds a high power-handling capacity and a high radiation efficiency. In final, a prototype of the dual-mode wideband slot antenna is designed, fabricated, and tested to reveal its total efficiency higher than 88% and stable radiation pattern over the tuning band. Good agreement between the measured and the simulated results well validates the presented design concept.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3069584","Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20180305124543176,JCYJ20190728151457763); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018A030313481); Shenzhen University Research Startup Project of New Staff(grant numbers:860–000002110311); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071306); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395404","Cavity-backed slot antenna (CBSA);full-metal;independent tuning;movable metal posts;reconfigurable antenna","Metals;Slot antennas;Resonant frequency;Antenna radiation patterns;Tuning;Loading;Electric fields","","21","","29","IEEE","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By achieving those two main targets, the antenna, which can be classified as body-matched gradient index (GRIN) lens, maximizes signal penetration and forms a focused plane wave incident field distribution inside the torso. Consequently, it improves image quality in electromagnetic imaging (EMI) applications. A design process is proposed based on the theory of multilayer medium with different dielectric properties. To realize the obtained dielectric values, the structure is 3-D printed in a planar structure comprising multiple sets of holes forming four layers. Each row has eleven holes with different radii that are filled with freshwater to create four distinct permittivity layers. The fabricated lens is illuminated using an H-shaped slot antenna. It is tested on a torso phantom that is comprised of skin and fat layers and torso tissue-mimicking mixture. The GRIN lens antenna achieves a wide fractional bandwidth of 53% at 0.78–1.34 GHz with a size of  $130\times 130\times53.6$  mm3 ( $0.3\lambda _{0}\times 0.3\lambda _{0}\times 0.14\lambda _{0}$ , where  $\lambda _{0}$  is the wavelength at the lowest operating frequency).

The antenna is based on a proximity-fed circular patch, loaded with a ring patch and four rectangular slots. The design is planar without any use of rigid shorting posts or a complex feeding network. The reconfigurability is achieved by activating and deactivating the slots using p-i-n diodes to switch between TM02 (monopole-like mode) and perturbed TM02 distributions (broadside mode) of the antenna. For conformability, the antenna is fabricated using a highly flexible PDMS-conductive fabric composite. All the antenna parts, including the RF switches, wires, and dc biasing circuit, are fully encapsulated by PDMS to provide resilience against deformation and harsh environment. Investigations on the RF performance and mechanical stability of the antenna were conducted. Under various bendings, it was demonstrated that all the antenna components, including those for electronic switching, remained intact and in working order even under the radius bending of 40 mm, thus maintaining good pattern reconfigurability and overall performance. When bent, the measured results at 5.2 GHz show a stable radiation performance relative to those of the flat case (i.e., the maximum gain of 2.9 dBi and the efficiency of 64% in the broadside mode, corresponding to 1.75 dBi and 52% in the monopole-like mode).

We describe the design and performance of an octave bandwidth cone-disk antenna built to detect this signal in the band 40–90 MHz. The Cosmic Dawn signal is predicted to be wideband spectral feature orders of magnitude weaker than sky and ground radio brightness. Thus, the engineering challenge is to design an antenna at low frequencies, which is able to provide, with high fidelity, the faint cosmological signal, along with the foreground sky, to the receiver. The antenna characteristics must not compromise detection by imprinting any confusing spectral features on the celestial radiation, ground emission, or receiver noise. Innovation in the present design is operating an antenna electrically smaller than half-wave at the highest frequency of operation on the surface of a sufficiently large water body. The homogeneous and high permittivity medium beneath the small cone-disk antenna results in an achromatic beam pattern, high radiation efficiency, and minimum unwanted confusing spectral features. The antenna design was optimized in WIPL-D and FEKO.

The radome is then modeled with a cascaded network of two-port devices and generalized transmission lines based on the theory of surface equivalence and the method of moments. The cascaded network is used to relate the tangential components of the electromagnetic field at the inner surface of the radome to their counterparts at the outer surface of the radome which, in turn, are used to obtain the respective equivalent currents. Finally, these currents are used to determine the radiation pattern of the antenna in the presence of the radome.

Nevertheless, the state-of-art FZP lens antennas are limited to a single band due to the frequency-dependent feature, which hinders their use in multi-band applications. In this work, a shared aperture dual-band FZP metalens antenna is proposed by merging two single-band FZP metalens antenna operating at distinct frequency bands seamlessly into one. Instead of using conventional metallic conductors, double-screen metagrids are devised in this work to form the concentric rings. Because the metagrids show distinct transmission/reflection properties at different frequencies, the performance of one set of concentric rings operating at the one band will not be affected by the other operating at the different band. In addition, to compensate for the phase shift introduced by the metagrids, an additional dielectric ring layer is added atop the FZP taking advantage of additive manufacturing.

Their impedance bandwidth and compactness are limited by the waveguide cutoff. By using the TEM mode of a coaxial waveguide, a more compact structure with a larger bandwidth is possible at the expense of increased ohmic loss in the waveguide. Using this basis, a new type of slotted coaxial waveguide antenna is presented. A compact waveguide array means that the element and array aspects are not independent, and with no accurate transmission line models for the structure, the design is from a parametric study by simulation. Two basic designs are demonstrated: the first with no constraint on the azimuthal extent of the slots, and the second where some mechanical strength of the waveguide is maintained by constraining the azimuthal extent of the slots to be 90° or less. The parametric studies provide insight for realizing the high bandwidth, and measurements of prototypes confirm the performance.

The measured beam patterns exhibit unexpected frequency- and polarization-dependent pointing offsets (squint) in both horizontal (H) and vertical (V) directions for the copolarization patterns, as well as distinctive asymmetries in the horizontal direction for the cross-polarization patterns in the upper half of the band. These effects were not predicted by design stage simulations that are based on the excitation of the fundamental waveguide mode only. Conventional large reflector simulation strategies used in the literature idealize the orthomode transducer (OMT) and waveguide and exclude this module from primary beam simulations entirely. This research shows that the inclusion of MeerKAT’s wide-bandwidth OMT and waveguide in the simulation is critical to the excitation of the TE21 mode, which results in the asymmetric features observed in the measurements. It is found that the characteristic frequency-dependent asymmetries of the primary beams are a consequence of the design of the OMT and cannot be attributed to manufacturing tolerances, reflector collimation errors, nor the coupling to conductive structures near the feed horn.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3070110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9397285","Asymmetry;computational electromagnetics (EMs);large reflector simulations;orthomode transducer (OMT);primary beam;squint;waveguide mode TE21","Feeds;Solid modeling;Optical waveguides;Electromagnetic waveguides;Antenna measurements;Transducers;Extraterrestrial measurements","","7","","10","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The symmetrical two-port feeding network consists of uniformly spaced slots in the ground and a bent microstrip line beneath the slots, so that two identical beams are realized.

Subsequently, a panel adjustment matrix for the whole reflector is derived to calculate the reflector deformation caused by the actuator adjustment. Next, the root mean square (rms) error of the deformed reflector is expressed as a quadratic form in the matrix form, and the adjustment value can be derived easily and promptly from the corresponding extreme value. The solution is expected to be unique and optimal since the aforementioned quadratic form is a convex function. Finally, a 35 m reflector antenna is adopted to perform the panel adjustments, and the effect of the adjustment errors is discussed. The results show that compared with the traditional model, where the panel elastic deformation is not considered, the proposed method exhibits a higher accuracy and is more suitable for use in large reflectors with a high operation frequency.

However, it is well known that stacking several conducting sheets and breaking the alignment of the stack can bring multiple benefits to the structure. In this article, the analysis and design of stacks of 2-D aperture arrays are carried out by exploiting as much as possible all the potential of a rigorous and systematic formulation based on the multimodal equivalent circuit approach (ECA). A key feature of the formulation is that linear transformations between the apertures of adjacent plates (rotation, translation, and scaling) can be dealt with from a purely analytical perspective. This fact is of potential interest for many practical applications, such as the design of polarization converters, absorbers, filters, and thin matching layers. When the apertures have an arbitrary geometry, it can be applied a hybrid approach that combines the ability of commercial simulators to handle arbitrary geometries with the fast computation times and physical insight of the ECA. In general, either the purely analytical or the hybrid approach can be applied in those many practical scenarios where the spatial profile of the electric field on the considered apertures hardly changes with frequency. As an additional feature of the approach, the dispersion properties (phase/attenuation constants and Bloch impedance) of infinite periodic stacks can be derived, and in particular, analytical expressions for the mirror- and glide-symmetric configurations are provided.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3070150","Spanish Research and Development National Program(grant numbers:TIN2016- 75097-P,RTI2018-102002-A-I00,B-TIC-402-UGR18,TEC2017-84724-P,FPU18/01965); Junta de Andalucía(grant numbers:P18-RT-4830); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9397341","3-D periodic stacks;analytical treatment;dispersion analysis;equivalent circuit approach (ECA);frequency-selective surface (FSS);glide symmetry;lossy materials;metamaterials","Apertures;Integrated circuit modeling;Dielectrics;Geometry;Power transmission lines;Scattering;Metals","","24","","69","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The unit cell of the proposed array is a two Butterfly radiating antennas separated by  $2\lambda \text{g}$  ( $\lambda \text{g}\,\,=$  effective wavelength) with two ports, where each Butterfly is a sequentially rotated series-fed microstrip patch antennas. Full-polarization reconfiguration (right-hand circular polarization (RHCP), left-hand circular polarization (LHCP), Linear-X, and Linear-Y polarization) is achieved by suitable excitation of the ports to realize increased system capacity. Flexible radiation pattern with dynamic 3 dB gain-beamwidth from 16° to 90° is achieved to realize a variable cellular range, angle, and gain requirements.

However, almost all of the works and studies in the literature with this title is related to the linear array geometry and involves range and one angle only. Therefore, the beam defined as dot-shaped is actually only 2-D and extends in one angle, thus breaking the dot shape. Moreover, to obtain such a beam shape, complex mathematical techniques and algorithms are used.

Next, formulas for the ratio of intensity radiated toward each half-space for an interfacial array are provided. In a consecutive step, an asymptotic approximation is derived for the current distribution in arrays of arbitrary loaded dipoles, and the reactance of a dipole in the array environment is related to the inductance of a grid of wires.

The intent is to develop a synthesis method that enables designers to realize arbitrary scattering matrices with cascaded, azimuthally invariant metasurfaces (subwavelength patterned metallic claddings) and dielectric spacers. The proposed method exploits a wave matrix formulation, which relates the incident and scattered fields on one side of a scatterer to those on the other side. It combines the merits of the scattering matrix and ABCD matrix.

In this novel communication paradigm, tunable metasurfaces redirect incident waves into the desired directions. To design and characterize such smart radio environments in any realistic scenario, it is necessary to know how these metasurfaces behave when illuminated from other directions and how scattering from finite-sized anomalous reflectors can be estimated. In this work, we analyze the far-field scattering of reflective metasurfaces and study the angular response of anomalous reflectors for arbitrary illumination angles. Using the surface-impedance model, we explain the dependence of the reflection coefficients of phase-gradient metasurfaces on the illumination angle and present numerical examples for typical structures. We also consider scattering from finite-sized metasurfaces and define a route toward including the full-angle response of anomalous reflections into the ray-tracing models of the propagation channel.

A numerical method based on SDEs is proposed, which is named the eigenmode theory in this article. In this method, SDEs are discretized into a generalized eigenvalue equation, which can be used to obtain a series of modal currents and expand the surface current induced by any excitation. The modal currents are only dependent on the shape and size of the PEC object and are independent of any specific excitation, including frequency, feeding location, and so on. This property results in an eigenmode theory with great potential in many challenging antenna designs.

Based on the investigation results, we propose a performance evaluation test suite allowing efficient and versatile benchmarking for antenna  $S$ -parameter optimization algorithms. The test suite consists of eight analytical functions (four unimodal functions, two multimodal functions, and two compositional functions). Each function matches a typical landscape of the EM-simulated antenna problems in the 2-D case. Seven of the functions are scalable to high-dimension problems. The performances of six widely used global optimization algorithms are evaluated using the test suite. The performance evaluation results are compared to those obtained using the two EM-based antenna problems (a single antenna and a multiantenna). The results using the proposed test suite for all six optimization algorithms are consistent with those of the real EM antenna problem.

At first, two optimization models, namely coarse and fine models, are constructed to describe the scattering problem. More specifically, the coarse model of shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) method provides worse accuracy results than the fine model of the method of moment (MoM). However, less computational resources are needed for the coarse model when compared with the fine model. Then the SBR method is implemented into the Hummingbird optimization algorithm to obtain the solution of the coarse model. Third, the solution of the coarse model is verified for the fine model by using the MoM. Noted that the impedance boundary condition is applied to accelerate the calculation. At last, the trust region aggressive space-mapping (TRASM) algorithm is used to find the optimal solution between the SBR and MoM methods. By building the mapping relationship between these two models, the optimization efficiency can be significantly improved with high accuracy.

When using the method, the extraction of the complex reflection coefficient (CRC) of the metal-backed material is the key to realize accurate measurement. Traditionally, the free-space reflection method assumes that the interrogating wave is a single plane wave, and the plane-wave reflection model is used. However, a focused beam is usually used in practice for reducing the edge effect that leads to the difference between the actual test scene and the traditional test model. In this study, a focused-wave reflection model is constructed to invert the complex permittivity, where the focused wave is considered as a Gaussian beam. The CRC of the Gaussian beam is deduced by using the plane-wave spectrum technique and plane-wave scattering-matrix (PWSM) theory. Based on the difference between the CRCs of the focused-wave and plane-wave, inverted complex permittivity corresponding to two reflection models is compared. Numerical results are given to show how the errors introduced by the plane-wave assumption are related to the waist size of the incident beam and the thickness and relative complex permittivity of the material.

It is shown that most of the visible impact on the total RCS of the ocean surface is due to first-order hydrodynamic terms and is concentrated between the Bragg peaks. Also, second-order hydrodynamic correction terms can increase the integral over the second-order region outside the dominant Bragg peak by up to 30% at extreme ocean conditions.

The use of a cross-polarized signal removes the difficulties arising from the strong copolar signal reflected by the ground plane. Concurrently, the cross-polarized signal is typically very weak, hindering the effectiveness of crosspolarized backscatterers in noisy and uncontrolled environments. Herein, the generalized optical theorem is used to derive upper bounds on the cross-polarized backscattering cross section of systems integrated with a ground plane and identify viable strategies to design them based on highly directive scattering systems. Popular antenna configurations, including elementary electric and magnetic dipoles and their combinations, such as Huygens sources and endfire arrays, are examined to ascertain which ones can be used to realize highly directive cross-polarized backscattering performance when they are integrated with a ground plane. Realistic single-antenna elements that attain the upper-bound performance are identified.

Second, the multiple scatterings between different plants are considered through the Foldy–Lax (FL) multiple-scattering equations using the calculated T-matrix and the translational addition theorem.

Here, we present a dielectric resonator antenna (DRA)-coupled infrared photodetector. Its performance is compared to a conventional resonant cavity-enhanced slab detector.

These compact structures, which support radiation of two orthogonal linear polarizations, are designed on a single-layer board using crossover technique. The dual-polarized scattering from the target is captured by the orthogonal subarrays. Furthermore, we introduce a method to combine data obtained from measured dual (co- and cross-) polarized fields to improve the recovery of edge information and increase image quality. The proposed single-layer designs have been fabricated and measured, which exhibits high port isolation and high polarization purity. The cross-polarization level is at least 22 and 25 dB lower than the copolarization pattern for  $2\times 1$  and  $4\times 1$  arrays, respectively.

In this work, a fast PD assessment method for a 5G mmWave mobile handset using the equivalent current (EQC) method is proposed. The EQC method utilizes the intermediate-field (IF) data collected by a spherical measurement system to reconstruct the EQCs over a reconstruction surface and then computes the PD in close proximity of the mobile handset with acceptable accuracy. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using a mmWave mobile handset mock-up equipped with four quasi-Yagi antennas.

A microwave spatial wave modulator (MSWM) realized by a programmable metasurface is applied to generate random mask patterns and modulate an OAM beam under test. The modulated fields are collected by a single-sensor detector. Two different algorithms can be used to reconstruct phase and magnitude profiles of the OAM beam, with the first one demands both amplitude and phase measurement while the second one only perceives the amplitude or intensity. Simulations are first carried out to investigate the effects of several parameters of the random mask patterns on the quality of reconstruction. Proof-of-concept experiments are then performed to characterize a microwave OAM beam, and obtained results show high-quality reconstructed phase and magnitude distributions of the OAM beam under test, which corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed SSCI technique.

However, biological tissues show considerable diversity in structure and consequently in dielectric properties. The first aim of this article is to determine how much the uncertainty of the body tissues’ constitutive parameters affects the prediction of the achievable radiation efficiency of the implant.

Four H-shape slots offer desired isolation between two paths of each feeding network, and also improve the impedance matching performance in two bands. Each dual-feed network is shared by two operating radiators, supporting simultaneous dual-band functionality. Meanwhile, the dual-band phase shifter is enabled by the folded shorted stubs that provide broadband dual-CP radiation performance.

A mode with VP omnidirectional radiation is first identified by analyzing an array of  $4 \times 4$  squared patches. To excite this mode, a complex feeding network is required, which leads to gain loss and increased structural complexity. Furthermore, the mode currents change with the frequency. Consequently, this mode cannot be excited efficiently in a wide bandwidth using a fixed feeding structure. To solve these problems, the modal current is analyzed at different frequencies. The sizes of the four corner patches and the other four edge patches are adjusted to optimize the modal behaviors. After optimization, the mode becomes much more desirable and can be efficiently excited in a wide bandwidth using a single probe. Therefore, the proposed antenna can be designed on a single-layer substrate and excited by a simple feeding structure with broadband characteristics.

First, a wideband CP FPRA composed of a partially reflective surface (PRS) with a positive reflection phase gradient and a wideband CP patch antenna is proposed. Then, a transmission metasurface (MS) with a high transmission magnitude and tunable transmission phase in a broadband range is proposed to correct the electric field phase above the antenna. This MS has the ability to independently tune the transmission phases of two orthogonally polarized waves. On the one hand, the nonuniform phase distribution on the aperture field of the antenna can be transmitted to be nearly uniform, so the gain of the antenna will be enhanced. On the other hand, the transmission phases of  $x$ - and  $y$ -polarized waves are corrected to maintain a 90° phase difference at every position, which leads to a wider axial ratio (AR) bandwidth. Therefore, after the phase correction of the MS, the gain and AR performances of the antenna are both improved significantly. The measured results suggest that the overlap of the 10 dB return loss bandwidth, 3 dB gain bandwidth, and 3 dB AR bandwidth of the antenna is 9–11.1 GHz (21%). The peak gain of 18.3 dBic is achieved at 10.2 GHz.

In contrast to conventional reflectarrays using metallic resonant cells or dielectric slabs as phasing elements with full metal ground, the proposed design uses air as the phasing element and a stepped dielectric mirror structure as the ground. In this way, the metal ground is removed, which makes the design an all-dielectric one. Taking advantage of the dielectric mirror that only exhibits a bandgap in the predesigned band while allowing electromagnetic (EM) waves to pass through it at the frequency out of the bandgap region, a dual-band reflectarray is obtained. By properly selecting the bandgap frequency of the dielectric mirror, the dual-band frequency ratio is scalable and can be very large. Furthermore, instead of using a metallic or dielectric resonator based on resonance, air layers with linear phase response are adopted as the phasing element. Thus, the reflectarray shows broadband and stable performance over the dual-band. Compared with the state-of-the-art works using printed circuit boards (PCBs) or microfabrication, the proposed design is low cost and lightweight, and can be rapidly prototyped.

Interpolation in a least-squares sense is first used to interpolate the topological structure of conformal arrays into that of uniformly spaced volumetric arrays. By applying the equivalent mathematical relationship between the 3-D discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the array factor of the uniform volumetric arrays, the 3-D-FFT is then developed to calculate the array factor of uniformly spaced volumetric arrays. Therefore, the array factor of conformal arrays can be easily calculated according to the interpolation relationship between the conformal arrays and the uniform volumetric arrays. Representative numerical examples regarding the array factor calculation of spherical arrays with different excitations are provided. In comparison with the direct calculation method, the obtained results confirm the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3076204","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631006,61721001,61571101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9423612","Conformal arrays;interpolation;nonuniform Fourier transformation (NUFFT)","Interpolation;Planar arrays;Linear antenna arrays;Discrete Fourier transforms;Three-dimensional displays;Approximation algorithms;Transmission line matrix methods","","7","","17","IEEE","4 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the DPS structure, dual phase shifters are combined into one beamforming weight. Compared with conventional phased array, the moduli of the weight vector are not necessarily fixed constants in the DPS structure but can be changed in a continuous interval. For this reason, we propose a method that turns the beampattern synthesis problem into a convex optimization problem. The method can be readily implemented and efficiently solved using freely accessible routines. We consider how to obtain the weight vector with two beampattern synthesis problems. The first one is to maximize the mainlobe gain (or minimize the mainlobe loss) when the notch level is determined. The second one is to minimize the notch level when the mainlobe gain (or the mainlobe loss) is determined. In both cases, we can get suboptimal solutions. Under different situations, numerical results of simulations confirm the effectiveness of the two algorithms.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3076505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9424470","Beampattern synthesis;convex optimization;dual-phase-shifter (DPS);phased array","Phased arrays;Phase shifters;Convex functions;Gain;Signal to noise ratio;Optimization;Numerical models","","12","","20","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both theoretical and experimental results show that the major axis of the elliptically polarized wave generated by such a combination has an angle of 0° or 90° to the E-plane of the LP radiator. The angle between the major axis and the E-plane depends on the phase difference of the two orthogonal electric components after propagating through the polarizer. Measurement has been conducted for verification which covered the entire V-band (50–75 GHz). The result in this communication provides instructions for the usage of artificial anisotropic polarizers in detection and measurement, such as the calculation of the polarization efficiency during transmission.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3076268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9423533","Antenna measurement;artificial anisotropic polarizer;elliptical polarization;major axis;millimeter-wave;terahertz;V-band","Antennas;Polarization;Antenna measurements;Slabs;Mathematical model;Electric fields;Dielectrics","","2","","30","IEEE","4 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the HMDA, the H-matrix algorithm is employed to compress the lower–upper decomposition matrix in the lower levels, whereas the butterfly algorithm is adopted at the higher levels.

In this communication, it is shown that it is the approximation of the singularity which is the main cause of this problem. Using the mixed potential integral equation, paralleling the classic RWG formulation for surfaces, the formulation in this communication approximates the surface (as opposed to equivalent filamentary) current, and applies Galerkin testing on the wire surface. The use of contemporary singularity-canceling integral transforms for highly efficient and accurate quadrature is demonstrated. Results are presented for typical thin-wire dipoles for both radiation and scattering problems. It is shown that with a rigorous treatment of the singularity, a far more comprehensive convergence study may be undertaken than previously demonstrated. Furthermore, the results shown justify the many years of successful use in practice of simple source models with modest mesh requirements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3076520","Western Australian State Government; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9424368","Convergence;method of moments (MoMs);mixed potential integral equation (MPIE);wire antennas","Method of moments;Wires;Integral equations;Convergence;Testing;Electric potential;Antennas","","8","","23","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
