Maxwell's equations describe how electricity and magnetism are related to each other, and how both are related to the properties of the source, i.e., charge's density and velocity. Considering charge's properties in space and time as a whole, electricity and magnetism will no longer be two separate mechanisms but only two different dimensional aspects of one single phenomenon. In this article, there is a short discussion on how the magnetic component of an EM field can be distinguished. We search for an ideal structure that responds exclusively to this aspect of the field. Mentioning the inevitable limits, some definitions for the figure of merit (FoM) and the efficiency factor of magnetic antennas (and probes) are suggested, the existing structures are investigated, and finally, by putting all the pieces together, a new structure is proposed. Along with higher FoM, the new structure has the advantage of being practically feasible with no need for active devices or balun transformers.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9301246","Balanced loop antenna;magnetic near-field antenna;magnetic probe;shielded-loop antenna","Magnetic shielding;Magnetic noise;Magnetic flux;Magnetic separation;Antennas;Scattering;Probes","","4","","19","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed concept, the traveling wave in a wave-guiding structure serves as the carrier wave whose amplitude is spatially modulated by a predefined modulating waveform to generate the desired modulated waves. Two analysis methods are subsequently developed to analyze the amplitude modulation effects. It is demonstrated that spatial amplitude modulation corresponds to shifting the spatial spectrum of the modulating wave up to the carrier spatial frequency. Therefore, one can judiciously design the modulating waveform to control the spatial frequency spectrum of the modulated waves. The spatial frequencies fallen within the radiation region are fast waves, which can radiate into free space. In this manner, the AM structure works as a leaky-wave antenna. To justify the proposed concept, two AM leaky-wave antennas based on corrugated transmission line are designed. The first one is a sinusoidally modulated AM leaky-wave antenna for high-gain application. The second is a beam-forming AM leaky-wave antenna, whose modulating waveform is synthesized to generate flat-top radiation pattern. Both simulated and measured results are given to demonstrate the concept, theory, and design of the AM leaky-wave antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044673","Hong Kong Research Grants Council under the Theme-Based Research Scheme(grant numbers:T42-103/16-N); General Research Fund(grant numbers:CityU 11203117); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9305930","Amplitude modulation;beam-forming;corrugated transmission line (CTL);leaky-wave antenna;traveling wave","Leaky wave antennas;Frequency modulation;Amplitude modulation;Antennas;Harmonic analysis;Power transmission lines;Time-frequency analysis","","34","","54","IEEE","23 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The time-periodic space-uniform modulation of a distributed shunt array of varcapacitors excites a mode with very small frequency but still a small (microwave) wavelength: the matching line then retains a practical size. The modulated transmission line brings the problem of impedance matching to a frequency f0 much higher than the signal, where the large antenna reactance can be easily compensated with a much higher bandwidth for the same Q factor: actually the bandwidth Δf = f0 / Q becomes large when f0 is much larger than the signal frequency. A simple way to obtain the space uniform modulation of the transmission line is illustrated, making use of a Wheatstone-bridge arrangement of the modulated varicaps. The signal and modulating lines, running in parallel on a section of the same length, see two very different equivalent shunt capacitances, so that the modulating voltage is almost uniform while the signal voltage may change significantly across the transmission line.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362152","Electrically small;impedance matching;metasurface;small antenna;time modulation;very low frequency (VLF)","Modulation;Frequency modulation;Capacitance;Antennas;Conductors;Time-frequency analysis;Impedance","","3","","28","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traditional hexagonal artificial impedance surface (H-AIS) and Voronoi artificial impedance surface (V-AIS) antennas are shown to exhibit near identical surface impedance profiles, insertion loss, radiation efficiency, and realized gain. However, the Voronoi partition can be adapted to follow an arbitrary conformal surface, whereas the hexagonal grid is restricted to a 2-D plane. To reinforce this advantage, a third metasurface antenna on an arbitrary conformal geometry is designed utilizing numerically generated “reference” and “objective” fields.

This antenna is intended as a transmitter for underwater and underground communication applications. In mechanical antennas, instead of using signal generators to drive the antenna for radiation, the radiation is induced by accelerating (rotating) electric charges or permanent magnets. One important challenge for mechanical antennas is to find an approach to modulate the information signal with sufficient bandwidth. We propose a novel PM scheme by rotating a permanent magnet which is sandwiched between two pairs of orthogonal bow-tie shape high- μ magnetic material plates. By moving the angular position of the magnetic plates, it is shown that the phase and amplitude of the EM signal can be modulated. The amplitude modulation is significant and this provides an additional important feature, which allows the antenna to generate higher harmonics of the rotation frequency, and thereby it facilitates radiation at a much higher frequency than the rotational frequency of the magnet. Hence, higher range and more radiated power can be achieved. Here, the performance of proposed mechanical antenna with its PM and frequency multiplication capability is first verified analytically and through numerical simulations using ANSYS Maxwell. Then, a prototype of the antenna is fabricated with the aid of low cost 3-D-printing technology and its performance is measured. Measurements are in good agreement with the simulation predictions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9298916","Mechanical antennas;phase modulation (PM);rotating magnet;underwater communication;very-low-frequency (VLF) signal generation","Magnetic moments;Magnetic flux;Magnetic resonance imaging;Frequency modulation;Magnetic separation;Antennas;Phase modulation","","19","","39","IEEE","18 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We found that the antenna efficiency can be evaluated with the field distribution over the second aperture, and the antenna efficiency is factorized into three factors: efficiencies of beam coupling, transmission spillover, and reception spillover. The factorization is applicable to general aperture-type antennas with beam waveguides and can relate the aperture efficiency to the pupil function.

This construction largely overcomes the problems of weight and cost that have tended to make larger low-frequency Luneburg lenses impractical. A penalty for this type of design is that some anisotropy exists in the lens's dielectric. This effect is examined using both ray-tracing techniques and full-wave simulation, and it is found that the principal consequence is that the focal length of the lens varies in different directions. Methods for mitigating the effect are proposed. A prototype lens antenna intended for cellular use in the band 3.3-3.8 GHz with dual-linear slant polarized feeds was designed and constructed to confirm the findings. The measured results show a peak gain of 23 dBi, which is less than 1 dB lower than the maximum possible directivity from the lens's cross-sectional area. Scanning loss is less than 0.8 dB over the whole sphere. The simulated and measured performances show excellent agreement over the whole sphere. The overall performance of the prototype lens antenna demonstrates that this type of lens should be very suitable for use in high-gain multibeam antennas at lower microwave frequencies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9301171","Anisotropy;conducting inclusions;dual-linear slant polarized;lightweight;ray tracing;spherical Luneburg lens","Lenses;Refractive index;Dielectrics;Shape;Ray tracing;Antenna measurements;Microwave antennas","","27","","31","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A C-band design promises 9.5-12.5 dBi gain indicating 5 dB improvement on average compared to that of the individual elements. Accurate deployment required for effective feeding of the DRAs in the subarray and the subarray sidelobe-level dependence on its aperture fields has been discussed. A comprehensive design guideline has been presented to enable one to accurately designing it in any specified frequency within the given limit. This antenna has been experimented to realize different array configurations. The linear array featuring zero interelement spacing emerges as a compact high-gain configuration with a reduced number of feed requirements.

The challenge of realizing such a radially varying profile and the limitations in dielectric material choices are overcome by two additive-manufacturing-aided approaches: 1) partially infilled dielectrics with a varied periodicity, which ensures the lens performance at the higher end of the frequency range and 2) artificially engineered dielectrics (AED) with subwavelength-scale metallic inclusions, which enables-high permittivity dielectrics and leads to benefits of thickness and mass reduction for the GRIN lenses. Measured results demonstrate that the GRIN lenses improve the gain of open-ended waveguide sources by 8.7-15.6 dB over a wide frequency range from 12 to 40 GHz, with the realized gain of up to 23.6 dBi.

One of the biggest challenges for the nonlinear inverse problem is to alleviate an ill-posedness resulting in poor accuracy. In this article, a novel source reconstruction method, which is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) enhanced by eigenmode currents, is proposed. Eigenmode currents, which work as macro basis functions, can be obtained numerically once precise geometry of the array antennas is found. The proposed source reconstruction method is named an ANN-EC (eigenmode currents) and is applied to diagnosis of array antennas based on phaseless near-field data. The ANN-EC has two advantages over conventional source reconstruction techniques purely based on the ANN. The first one is enhancement of accuracy and the second one is robustness to noise. Both of these advantages stem from reduction of the number of eigenmode currents using source reconstruction. Accuracy of the reconstructed currents is evaluated and these advantages of the ANN-EC over conventional ANN are demonstrated. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper demonstrating the effectiveness of the eigenmode currents on the nonlinear inverse problem.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044593","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:18K13736,18K04116); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9301192","Antenna diagnosis;array antenna;artificial neural network (ANN);current distribution;inverse problem;near field;source reconstruction","Antenna arrays;Current measurement;Antenna measurements;Dipole antennas;Reconstruction algorithms;Inverse problems;Image reconstruction","","28","","36","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the errors caused by circuit implementations, quantized control, and imperfect isolation between antenna elements result in radiation pattern (RP) distortion and performance deterioration. In particular, the quantization error and mutual coupling cause the active reflection coefficient (ARC) of each antenna element to vary with respect to the main beam direction, resulting in statistical behavior changes depending on steering angles. In this article, we derive the statistical behavior of RPs with all those dominant errors taken into account. The analysis reveals that Beckmann distribution offers the exact solution for the cumulative distribution of the sidelobe level (SLL), which is very consistent with a Monte Carlo simulation including the ARC. In addition, the Rician distribution reflecting the three errors exhibits overall good accuracy, with inherent deviation from the Monte Carlo simulation results at certain steering angles due to the approximation of uncorrelated RPs and identical variances that are not valid in real antenna arrays. Our analysis also indicates that, to define the maximum probability of exceeding a certain SLL, the variance and correlation should be considered along with the mean of the RPs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3048528","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) funded by the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:IITP-2018-0-00823); Investigation on future mm-Wave circuits, packages, and system and the BK21 plus program through the National Research Foundation (NRF); Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318478","Antenna radiation patterns (RPs);error analysis;mutual coupling;random noise","Manganese;Mutual coupling;Quantization (signal);Phase distortion;Antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Rician channels","","20","","28","CCBYNCND","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aimed at this challenging issue, a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to achieve high directivity and low sidelobe simultaneously for tetromino-shaped irregular arrays. An embedded structure algorithm has been applied to efficiently optimize a large-scale array with 2-D 60° maximum scanning angles.

The proposed structure consists of two stacked parallel-plate waveguides of circular shape. The rays generated by a point source located at the periphery of the bottom waveguide propagate along curvilinear paths, whose trajectories result from a variable refractive index profile with azimuthal symmetry. Then, these rays encounter a reflecting boundary and emerge all parallel in the upper uniform waveguide. The behavior of this lens resembles that of a flat Luneburg lens, with the fundamental difference that it works in reflection.

The concept is numerically verified through different implementations of the effective refractive index profile, including a metasurface-based implementation.

First, a general circuit model with shunt short-ended stubs and an i-section nonuniform transmission line is discussed, whose frequency response can be synthesized with Chebyshev functions over a wide frequency range. Following the synthesis procedure, all the circuit parameters can be derived from the specifications of the filtering response, such as filtering order N (≥4), fractional bandwidth (FBW), and equal-ripple return loss (RL). Then, the general circuit model is applied to design high-order and wideband 3-D bandpass FSS, which is physically realized by using stacked printed circuit board pieces etched with slotlines and microstrip lines. As an example, a fourth-order 3-D FSS with FBW = 80% and equal-ripple RL = 10 dB is designed to show the establishment of good relationship between the circuit model and the physical model. To further improve the frequency selectivity, another two coupling paths independent of the main transmission path are created by simultaneously adjusting the FSS thickness and the separation of slotline sections, thus introducing two transmission zeros at both skirts of the passband. Both design examples are fabricated and measured. Good agreement between measured results and simulated ones indicates that the proposed synthesis method can provide an efficient and accurate solution to design such a class of wideband and high-order 3-D FSSs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044637","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071243,61971475,61901226); Science and Technology Development Fund of Macau under FDCT Research(grant numbers:0095/2019/A2); University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00007-FST,MYRG2018-00073-FST); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX18_0873); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9301190","Chebyshev functions;frequency-selective structures (FSSs);sharp roll-off skirt;synthesis design;wide passband","Integrated circuit modeling;Wideband;Filtering;Frequency selective surfaces;Chebyshev approximation;Frequency synthesizers;Passband","","25","","29","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then develop fast algorithms to convert the FMM-based H2-matrix whose rank is full asymptotically to a new H2-representation, whose rank is minimized based on accuracy. The proposed algorithms cost O(k3) in time for each cluster in cluster basis generation and O(k2) in memory, where k is the minimal rank of the cluster basis required by accuracy. When the rank of the H2-matrix is a constant, the complexity of the proposed algorithms is O(N) in both time and memory consumption. When the rank is a variable dependent on electrical size, the total complexity can be evaluated based on the rank's behavior.

Here, we present a comprehensive FDTD implementation of nonlocal hydrodynamics, including parallel computing. As a subnanometer step size is required to resolve nonlocal effects, a parallel implementation makes the computational cost of nonlocal FDTD more affordable. We first validate our algorithms for small spherical metallic particles, and find that nonlocality smears out staircasing artifacts at metal surfaces, increasing the accuracy over local models.

The electron density in these sporadic-E (Es) clouds can sometimes be so high that radio waves with frequencies up to 150 MHz are obliquely reflected. While this phenomenon is well known, the reflection mechanism itself is not well understood. To investigate this question, an experimental system has been developed for accurate polarimetric and fading measurements of 50 MHz radio waves obliquely reflected by mid-latitude Es layers. The overall sensitivity of the system is optimized by reducing environmental electromagnetic noise, giving the ability to observe weak, short-lived 50 MHz Es propagation events. The effect of the ground reflection on observed polarization is analyzed and the induced amplitude and phase biases are compensated. It is found that accurate measurements are only possible below the pseudo-Brewster angle. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, initial empirical results are presented which provide clear evidence of magneto-ionic double refraction.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9301351","Brewster angle;ionosphere;polarization;radio noise;radio wave propagation;sporadic-E (Es);very high frequency (VHF)","Reflection;Ionosphere;Ionization;Antenna measurements;Clouds;Refractive index;Plasmas","","11","","78","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While this is acceptable for many applications, in some instances, where Maxwell’s equations are solved alongside systems with slower propagation velocities, explicit methods prove costly. This is the case for nonrelativistic electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell methods that are required to study plasma thrusters. Several algorithms have been proposed to retain a nearly explicit formulation using large time steps to achieve higher CFL values. Among these is the semi-Lagrangian constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method. While the ability of this method to handle CFL > 1 has been demonstrated for planar 2-D–3-D cases, this has not been done for 2-D cases with cylindrical symmetry. In this article, a procedure is presented to compute the electromagnetic wave propagation in 2-D domains with cylindrical symmetry using the CIP method. The CIP scheme is extended for CFL ≥ 1 cases, and a ghost node method is proposed to deal with the axis singularity and with the wall boundary condition.

The theory is verified with measurements from a proof-of-concept system, and security is evaluated using information beamwidths calculated from error probability overlook angle. Results indicate that, when compared to conventional methods and keeping the hardware consistent, SAPM has a much narrower angular range of demodulation around the intended receiver-often by over 20°, depending on the receiver's error rate threshold.

This communication presents a wideband and compact flexible meander-line antenna array for a wearable EM head imaging system. The antenna is designed and optimized on a 4 mm thick low-cost, flexible room-temperature-vulcanizing (RTV) silicone substrate in close vicinity to a multitissue head model. The antenna comprises two sections of meander-lines, a full ground plane, and a 50 Ω coaxial connector. The measured reflection coefficient |S11| on a human head shows that the proposed antenna operates effectively across the frequency band of 0.45-3.6 GHz, attaining fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 155%. The antenna achieves unidirectional radiations with greater than 9 dB of front-to-rear ratio in the near-field region, and safe-level maximum specific-absorption rate (SAR) below 0.2 W/kg using an input power of 10 dBm.

In particular, based on the membership between the antenna elements and subarrays, the dictionary matrix, the resulting sparse excitation vector, and the sparse binary vector are introduced to describe the array pattern and exact tiling of the aperture. Therefore, the synthesis of irregular phased arrays without overlaps and holes satisfying given maximum sidelobe level (SLL) and minimum directivity can be summarized as a mixed integer nonconvex programming problem, where both the subarray tiling configurations and the associated complex excitations are optimized simultaneously. To avoid the nonconvexities, some mathematical transformations in terms of directivity are implemented and the binary sparse vector is relaxed to be a real sparse vector by the minimization of the weighted l1-norm. Consequently, the nonconvex problem is reduced to iterative convex optimization problems, where several convex optimization problems are included and can be efficiently solved using convex optimization solver. The excellent performances of the proposed method are verified by comparing with previously reported methods through several numerical examples.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044632","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631006,61721001); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M683284); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9301355","Convex optimization;irregular phased arrays;subarray tiling","Phased arrays;Transmission line matrix methods;Manganese;Antenna arrays;Apertures;Optimization;Convex functions","","43","","23","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main ingredient of the presented approach is a frequency-based regularization. It allows for smoothening the functional landscape of the assumed cost function, defined to encode the prescribed design specifications. The regularization is implemented as a special penalty term complementing the primary objective and enforcing the alignment of the antenna responses with the target operating frequency (or frequencies for multiband antennas). The result is an improved reliability and reduced cost of the optimization process, both highly desirable from the point of view of the efficacy of electromagnetic (EM)-driven design procedures. Furthermore, regularization makes the use of local routines sufficient even in situations where the global search is otherwise imperative (e.g., due to poor initial design). Our methodology is demonstrated using three microstrip antennas. The superior performance of the approach, both in terms of design reliability and in terms of the computational cost of the optimization process, is corroborated by comparisons with a conventional formulation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3044664","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:206606051); National Science Centre of Poland(grant numbers:2018/31/B/ST7/02369); Abu-Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) Award for Research Excellence 2019(grant numbers:AARE19-245); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9301361","Antenna optimization;electromagnetic (EM) analysis;EM-driven design;frequency-based regularization;gradient-based search","Antennas;Optimization;Linear programming;Resonant frequency;Task analysis;Reflector antennas;Radio spectrum management","","19","","41","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
