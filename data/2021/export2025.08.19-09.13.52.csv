Aimed at this problem, this article presents a novel design strategy of microstrip patch antennas with low in-band RCS. This strategy combines metasurface with antenna from the perspectives of both structure and electrical performance. To be specific, anisotropic metasurface is proposed to replace the conventional patch and behave as the radiating structure of the antenna directly, which does not increase the original antenna size. Through proper connection of the metasurface units, the novel antenna has the same radiation performance with conventional microstrip antenna but low in-band RCS for any polarized incidence. The radiation and scattering mechanism of the novel antenna is carefully elaborated, from which a frequency reconfigurable antenna is also derived by loading varactors. Furthermore, different design strategies of low in-band-RCS antenna element and array are clarified. On the basis of which, a 4 × 4 array is developed to achieve in-band-RCS reduction with radiation performance kept. Both numerical and experimental results are demonstrated, and the reasonably good agreements verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3016161","Postdoctoral Innovative Talents Support Program of China(grant numbers:BX20180375); NSFC(grant numbers:61801508,61701523,61671464); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province, China(grant numbers:2019JQ-103,2018JM6040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9170751","Antenna array;metasurface;microstrip antenna;radar cross section (RCS) reduction;reconfigurable","Microstrip antennas;Microstrip;Scattering;Antenna arrays;Loaded antennas","","66","","37","IEEE","18 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CA is simulated in the vicinity of the canonical arm tissue model in HFSS software and examined in a realistic human model. The far-field gain is -18.5 dB with -32 dB isolation between elements. The CA is fabricated, and measurements are carried out in skin-fat-muscle phantom and minced pork. Simulated results closely match with measured results. The results show that the proposed CA is polarization and 3-D orientation insensitive and provides good MIMO properties.

In this article, the effect of traditional solid bowtie antenna design on an MD is investigated, and avenues for the reduction of the eddy currents are explored. Three modifications to the solid bowtie design are proposed and evaluated. This article presents the measurements of the MD response to all four antenna designs using a magnetic induction spectroscopy sensor.

The proposed shared-aperture antenna is implemented by combining a folded transmitarray (TA) antenna operating in Ka-band and a Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity antenna operating in X-band together. In this configuration, the shared aperture serves as a phase-shifting surface for the TA antenna and as a partially reflective surface for the FP antenna simultaneously. Since both of the two antennas radiate into free space through the same physical aperture, the aperture reuse efficiency of the proposed shared-aperture antenna is 100%. A four-layered, metallic double-ring structure is selected as the unit cell (UC) to implement the shared aperture to fulfill the aforementioned requirements. It is found that the frequency responses of the UC in Xand Ka-bands are highly independent, which can be controlled separately to facilitate the antenna design and optimization. Two dual-polarized patch antennas operating in Xand Ka-bands are utilized to enable a dual-polarized manner of the proposed shared-aperture antenna. The simulated results reveal that the proposed shared-aperture antenna has -10 dB bandwidth of 9.8-10.2 GHz and 26.5-29 GHz with the realized gain of 14.8 dBi (at 10 GHz) and 24.4 dBi (at 28 GHz) in two polarizations.

A 3-D kernel function is obtained to match the EMF generated on an arbitrarily oriented antenna. Computations show that as the dip and azimuth angles of an antenna vary in a wide range, the fluctuations on the input impedance always remain within 10%, with the change mainly reflected on the real part. The discrepancy caused by an induced EMF will be more significant when the antenna length reaches 1 km, which should not be ignored for long antennas.

Mathematically, the array factor bounds of array antennas with interval uncertainties can be taken as the bounds of the modulus of the sum of the complex intervals with both the modulus and argument errors (CIMAS). The PKA for the modulus of CIMAS consists of three theorems: 1) the necessary conditions for each complex interval for the upper modulus bound of CIMAS; 2) the method for judging whether the lower modulus bound of CIMAS equals zero; and 3) the necessary conditions for each complex interval for the nonzero lower modulus bound of CIMAS.

Microstrip patch arrays with such single-feed dual-CP dual-beam functionalities can be synthesized through a straightforward analytical approach that accurately predicts the radiation patterns for both right- and left-handed CP beams. The proposed technique and design methodology were verified by two proof-of-concept microstrip arrays consisting of  $8 \times 8$  linearly polarized circular patch elements operating in the  $K$ -band, one with uniform excitation amplitudes and the other with tapered excitations for sidelobe suppression. Both arrays were fabricated and measured, experimentally achieving a joint  $S_{11} < -10$  dB, axial ratio < 3 dB, and 3 dB gain bandwidth of more than 22.5%/20.0% and 16.7%/15.8%, respectively, for the right- and left-handed CP beams. Within this broad operational band, the beam squinting is on average within ±3°. The proposed dual-CP dual-beam arrays have fully planarized structures, low profiles, wide operational bandwidths, and high polarization purity, making them useful candidates for applications including satellite communications, point-to-multipoint communications, and so on.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3016500","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61801109,61627801); High Level Innovation and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program in Jiangsu; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9171558","Dual-circularly polarized (Dual-CP);microstrip patch arrays;sequential rotation technique;wideband","Microstrip antenna arrays;Phased arrays;Microstrip antennas;Microstrip;Bandwidth;Broadband antennas","","29","","48","IEEE","19 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Comparing to a full-digital multibeam array, the digital beamforming (DBF) processing is simplified in the proposed scheme, significantly alleviating the computational burden of data processing. Since the radiation beams are generated by only a part of the radio frequency (RF) channels in the hybrid multibeam array, the power consumption could be reduced by powering down the idle channels.

We present two instances with geometrically controlled and electrically controlled notch bands, respectively. Without decreasing absorption performance, the notch position can be flexibly adjusted throughout the entire frequency band by simply modifying the dimension of the lossless frequency-selective surface (FSS) or changing the capacitance of the varactor, i.e., using geometric control or electrical control. The narrow notch band allows two wide absorption bands to be retained on both sides; therefore, good stealth performance is still guaranteed. Equivalent circuit models (ECMs) are proposed to further explain the principle. The frequency-domain simulation, ECM, time-domain simulation, and experimental results are in good agreement and validate the adjustability and high selectivity of the notched absorbers.

First, an infinite planar structure is considered. Three methods are proposed to calculate the isotropic homogenized dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability that approximate accurately the reflection coefficient of the stratified structure for propagative and evanescent waves.

We derive a vector wave equation from Maxwell's equations for a medium which has an inhomogeneous dielectric permittivity dominated by variation along one dimension. It is well known that the electric field components decouple for homogeneous media. However, 1-D permittivity variations yield an upper triangular system of scalar wave equations with the wave polarization component parallel to the inhomogeneous direction/axis acting as a forcing term for the orthogonal components. The main implication is that waves with polarization oriented parallel to the permittivity gradient will act as a forcing term and excite other polarization components and, thus, induce depolarization. Contemporary studies treat the permittivity as a constant when deriving a wave equation or paraxial approximation, and then re-introduce via inhomogeneous wave speed, variable permittivity, thus missing important terms and physical mechanisms in their resulting equations. Contemporary studies neglect the term in the Maxwell vector wave equation responsible for this effect.

In this article, we present a method to decompose and extract different scattering mechanisms such as specular scattering, multiple scattering, and creeping waves from the scattered field. The theoretical basis of the method is that the wave corresponding to different scattering mechanisms reaches the receiver at different time. Thus, we acquire the whole scattered field through simulation or experimental test at first. Then, we perform the signal processing with time-frequency analysis to obtain the arrival time of different scattering mechanisms. According to the time slot difference, the time-domain signal at each frequency can be decomposed and different scattering mechanisms can be extracted.

Both TAFS and simplified TAFS (S-TAFS) first rely on isolating the attenuation induced by different atmospheric constituents, each of which is separately up-scaled to the target frequency. The two methods are tested against a full year of data collected at Ka-band and Q-band at Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in the framework of the Alphasat Aldo Paraboni propagation experiment. Results indicate that both methods offer a very good accuracy in scaling the total attenuation from Kato Q-bands, both in terms of first-order statistics and of time series.

Effective radiation pattern synthesis is possible when using analytical formulas designed for the radiation patterns of antennas with semitransparent reflectors. In this article, we present a model for the scattering of a toroidal wave of a general form by means of a semitransparent reflector of revolution. The model allowed us to simulate the radiation patterns of various kinds of axisymmetric antennas with semitransparent reflectors and ground planes. Two asymptotic expansions of the radiation pattern of the model were found in the physical optics approximation. The expansions allow the radiation pattern for the entire space to be determined.

Resolution is one of the most important issues not being addressed with clear theoretical relations in medical MWI systems. In this analytical study, we thoroughly clarify the relation of resolution to the most fundamental aspects of an MWI system, namely, limited-view versus full-view array geometry, monostatic versus multistatic configuration, single-frequency versus wideband operation, and near-field versus far-field imaging. This goal is achieved by expressing the inverse scattering problem in the spatial frequency domain and utilizing K-space representation. Besides, to analyze the MWI system more accurately, the sidelobe level (SLL) of its point-spread function (PSF) is taken into account. We show that generally, the resolution limits of a multistatic configuration are the same as its monostatic counterpart and, hence, have no superiority in terms of resolution. In addition, in imaging with a full-view array, the signal bandwidth has no effect on the resolution. Thus, the single-frequency operation provides the same resolution as the wideband operation. We also demonstrate that the effect of using multistatic configuration or wideband operation is to reduce the SLL of the PSF and, hence, improve the image quality.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3016407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9171552","Breast cancer detection;microwave imaging (MWI);radar-based image reconstruction;resolution;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Radar imaging;Image resolution;Microwave imaging;Microwave theory and techniques;Geometry;Antenna arrays","","38","","34","IEEE","19 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a generalized coupling coefficient between two circular apertures in the Fresnel zone is derived. From the generalized coupling coefficient, explicit coupling coefficients between two circular (focused or unfocused) apertures supporting Gaussian, Bessel-Gaussian, and Laguerre-Gaussian beams are found in closed form. The analytically derived coupling coefficients and corresponding efficiencies are compared with those obtained through numerical integration of the reaction integral, as well as the results of a commercial electromagnetic solver. Then, it is demonstrated that a finite aperture, which supports a cylindrically apodized Bessel beam, is close to the optimal illumination. Also, it is shown that Bessel beams have a higher coupling coefficient than conventional Gaussian beams. Finally, the optimal aperture illumination is found numerically by constructing an aperture field from a summation of Bessel beams with different axicon angles. That is, the complex amplitude of each Bessel beam is found that maximizes coupling between the two apertures. The optimal illumination radiates a magnetic field equal to the complex conjugate of the receiver aperture's electric field. This observation agrees with those for optimal illumination in the context of a confocal optical resonator.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3026428","UM-KACST Joint Center for Microwave Sensor Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210209","Bessel beams;Fresnel zone;Gaussian beams;optimal illumination;wireless power transfer","Apertures;Couplings;Fresnel reflection;Lighting;Electromagnetics;Magnetic fields","","14","","26","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effect of the solar cell on the antenna was analyzed and validated. The impact of the antenna on the efficiency of the solar cell was quantified through experiments. It has been found that while the active semiconductor junction in a solar cell severely reduces the gain of the antenna in many space communication bands, the electrode lattice in the solar cell can potentially act as an isolation between the solar cell and the antenna, preventing the gain worsening. The effect of the lattice also promises a potential application in lab-grown solar cells such that one may carefully design the size and number of the electrodes to ensure the best gain for the integrated antenna. The main factor that impacts the efficiency of the solar cells was found to be the cover glass rather than the shadow from the antenna. These results can serve as design guidelines when integrating optically transparent antennas on solar panels of small satellites to reduce payload and to achieve reliable communication link. One may balance the selection of solar cells, cover glass, and antenna geometry to achieve the optimal link budget.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3016864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172134","Coupling;patch antenna;photo-voltaic;small satellite;solar cell","Photovoltaic cells;Conductivity;Electrodes;Glass;Patch antennas;Germanium","","12","","19","IEEE","20 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The LWA with 14 circular patches is fed by symmetrical spoof surface plasmon polariton (S-SSPP) lines. When the S-SSPP lines are excited by a common mode,  $ {z}$ -components of the magnetic fields are out-of-phase, and those of the electric fields are in-phase, due to the symmetrical structure. The radiation generated by the magnetic couplings (M-couplings) between these two SSPP transmission lines and the patch array strengthens each other, while the cross-polarized radiation produced by the electric couplings (E-couplings) cancels each other out. From another perspective, the M-couplings excite the horizontally polarized (H-pol) TM11 mode. The E-couplings excite the TM21 mode; thus, the E-couplings mainly appear at higher frequencies. As a result, the M-coupling and E-coupling mechanisms are separated successfully. Specifically, the LWA radiates H-pol waves with high purity. On the contrary, with the differential-mode excitation, the E-coupling patch array radiates vertically polarized (V-pol) waves. Finally, a dual-LP LWA with frequency-controlled scanning beams and suppressed cross-polarization levels is designed. Measured results show that the dual-LP beams scan from backward to forward. In the whole band, the cross-polarization levels are less than −30 dB in the scanning plane.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3015059","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0202102); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JB190205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9166619","Dual-linear polarization;leaky-wave antenna (LWA);suppressed cross-polarization levels;symmetrical spoof surface plasmon polariton (S-SSPP)","Magnetic fields;Electric fields;Surface waves;Couplings;Antennas;Plasmons;Dispersion","","46","","28","IEEE","13 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we use support vector regression (SVR) to compare this approach with a new strategy which consists in grouping the refletarray elements under a small set of angles of incidence and train surrogate models per angle of incidence pair. In this case, the dimensionality of the SVR decreases in two with regard to the former approach. In both cases, two geometrical variables are considered for reflectarray design, obtaining 4-D and 2-D SVRs, respectively. In contrast to the common approach in the literature, the comparison between the 4-D and 2-D SVRs shows that a proper discretization of the angles of incidence is more competitive than introducing the angles as input variables in the SVR. The 2-D SVR offers a shorter training time, faster reflectarray analysis, and a similar accuracy than the 4-D SVR, making it more suitable for design and optimization procedures.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.3015707","European Commission through the H2020 Project REVOLVE(grant numbers:MSCA-ITN-2016-722840); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades(grant numbers:TEC2017-86619-R (ARTEINE),IJC2018-035696-I); Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad(grant numbers:TEC2016-75103-C2-1-R (MYRADA)); Gobierno del Principado de Asturias/FEDER(grant numbers:GRUPIN-IDI/2018/000191); Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte/Programa de Movilidad “Salvador de Madariaga”(grant numbers:PRX18/00424); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9169817","Angle of incidence;machine learning;reflectarray antenna;support vector regression (SVR);surrogate model","Two dimensional displays;Training;Antennas;Computational modeling;Input variables;Analytical models;Support vector machines","","17","","20","IEEE","17 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We fabricated the designed absorber and measured its tunable reflectivity. The measured results indicate that the absorber can tune its absorbing frequency ranging from 3.53 to 7.05 GHz under normal incidence when changing bias voltages applied to the varactors from 0.5 to 10 V. By further varying the graphene resistance through the bias voltage, the absorbing amplitude at each absorbing frequency can be dynamically modulated. In addition, it is found that the absorber achieves polarization-insensitive characteristics due to the symmetrical design of the active FSS.

Two types of artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) unit-cells with a 180° ± 37° reflection phase differences are developed. Perforated superstrate is loaded on the top of conventional metallic patch-based AMC unit-cells which contributes to oblique incidence stability up to 60°. Moreover, it results in a wide operational frequency range of 16.5-58 GHz under normal incidence. To satisfy the periodicity condition, an appropriate number of proposed AMC unit-cells are considered as a super-cell. Then for the first time, the type and size of super-cells are optimized simultaneously. In consequence, maximum RCS reduction with a very uniformed scattered pattern is achieved. The superiority of the new arrangement over conventional coding arrangements is investigated for both monostatic and bistatic RCS results. It is shown that new structure results in a wider bandwidth, greater RCS reduction level and more uniformed scattered patterns. The proposed surface exhibits a very broadband of 111.5% for -10 dB normalized RCS reduction under normal incidence.

We show the results for different scenarios in which the surface impedances possess nonresonant or resonant characteristics, and the distance between the two metasurfaces changes from large values to the extreme limit of zero. We also derive and describe the general condition for existence of two modes with orthogonal polarizations having the same phase velocity. In the particular case in which the metasurfaces are complementary and the distance between them is not small, we indicate that such phenomenon occurs within a broad frequency range.

Second, for large-scale arrays, the synthetic functions (SFs) reusable scheme is proposed for both linear and nonlinear transformations. This scheme can improve the efficiency of constructing SFs and is especially suitable for large-scale arrays. Third, parallel algorithm is applied into SFX to further enhance its efficiency. As SFX deals with a large- scale electromagnetic system (EM system) block by block, parallel algorithm is an obvious and feasible way to improve its efficiency. Finally, a simplified ship and a cylindrical conformal array are adopted to verify the performance of parallel SFX.
