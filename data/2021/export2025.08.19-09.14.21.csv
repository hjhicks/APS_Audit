The dielectric vias consist of cylindrical holes drilled into the PCB substrate and filled with presintered nanoparticles of barium strontium titanate (BST). The BST nanoparticles were found to have a dielectric constant of 20, with an approximate loss tangent of ~0.05. The dielectric-vias loaded substrate constitutes an effective medium for the DRA design. The dielectric vias are arranged in a concentric manner around a core substrate material region, giving a wideband multiring SIDRA. It was found that the wideband behavior is due to two different dielectric resonator modes, namely, the TE δ11 mode and TE δ31 half-mode. The TE δ31 half-mode is a modified version of the TE δ31-mode of a regular dielectric resonator and is reported here for the first time.

By appropriately positioning the antenna with respect to the measurement system, it is possible to promote the low spatial frequency part of its spherical harmonic spectrum.

The focus lies on the analytical method for calculating the current distribution and input impedance of the antenna, where the current distribution, in this case, consists of two parts of distribution in both longitudinal and transverse directions. Kernel function for a strip antenna at arbitrary orientations is derived with the help of coordinate transformation, and the current integral equation is solved via the method of moments (MoM).

Simulation results using commercial software FEKO exhibit good consistency with the computed results, thus verifying the accuracy of the proposed method.

The resulting periodic side-fire antenna radiates in the plane of the antenna, whereby the leakage power can either be allowed to radiate in free-space or kept confined inside a parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) structure. The proposed side-fire structure can therefore be completely shielded, making it useful as a broadband spectrum analyzer that is compatible with substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technology. Furthermore, a convex side-fire antenna is demonstrated to focus the radiated beams in the near-field of the structure to make the entire system compact. The integrated spectrum analyzer is experimentally demonstrated between 59 and 66 GHz providing 1 GHz frequency resolution.

By adding symmetrical low-pass high-stop filters into the horizontal stub of the T-monopole and high-pass low-stop filters into the gap of the T-slot, an extra mode is introduced for each antenna, producing dual-band operation. Impedance bandwidths and radiation efficiencies of both bands can be adjusted flexibly using the filters. A detailed design guideline is given. The dual-band antenna pair operating at partial N78 (p-N78, 3.4~3.6 GHz) and partial N79 (p-N79, 4.8~4.9 GHz) is with a footprint of 15×6 mm2.

Beam steering at fixed frequencies is achieved by rotating both or either of the base and top gratings, thus finding roles that conventional frequency-steered LWAs are unable to serve. Within millimeter-wave (mm-wave) and THz regimes where components become strongly miniaturized, the advantages of electronic beam-scanning at lower microwave frequencies begin to get offset by the benefits of mechanical steering. Not only does the rotational form of steering enjoy the benefits of simplicity and low cost, it also circumvents the need for complex networks at mm-wave/THz regimes required by electronic-steering that annuls the strengths of LWA in the first place. The rotation in the horizontal plane also offers high weight-handling capability, making it all the more able to manage miniaturized structures at mm-wave/THz regimes.

A prototype operating at  $C$ -band (5 GHz) is designed, fabricated, and measured. It consists of a radiator and a feeding network. The radiator is formed by two annular aperture elements, of which the inner one is realized by a circular patch antenna while the outer one is formed by eight planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs). The feeding network drives annular aperture elements in the manner of sequential rotation. In this way, a CP isoflux beam array with a low profile ( $0.078~{\lambda }_{0})$ , lightweight, and ease-of-integration for CubeSat is realized. The proposed array can also be extended to realize other shaped beams.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060039","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871189); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515011999); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362214","Antenna array;antenna element;circular polarization (CP);CubeSat;earth coverage","Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Aperture antennas;Earth;CubeSat;Reflector antennas;Finite element analysis","","12","","39","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, three representative phasing approaches for reflectarray designs are briefly reviewed, and it is pointed out that when the polarization conversion is considered, these phasing approaches can be combined together to achieve more versatile functionalities and better performance. It is theoretically derived that using the mirror combining approach (MCA), broadband reflectarray elements with polarization conversion can be achieved. Using the rotational combining approach (RCA), both amplitude and phase of the reflected cross-polarization waves can be controlled. Next, a split ring element has been designed as an example to demonstrate the theoretical analysis. By using the MCA, the designed element achieves a linear 360° phase coverage, which suggests its capability of wideband operation. By using the RCA, the designed element achieves continuous amplitude modulation from 0 to 1 and full 360° phase coverage. Finally, a Ka-band reflectarray prototype with broadband behavior is designed, fabricated, and measured. It has achieved high-gain pencil beams pointing at predesigned directions. The measured gain at 20 GHz is 35.6 dBi with the aperture efficiency of 54.4% under linear-polarization (LP) excitation, and the gain is 35.4 dBi with the aperture efficiency of 52% under circular-polarization (CP) excitation.

In this article, by optimizing the field forming technique based on derived closed-form analytical expressions, a general nonuniform H-field distribution is proposed as an optimal solution to the misalignment problem. Through rigorous analysis, this work proposes a stepwise procedure for designing the Tx coil array antenna to generate the nonuniform H-field distribution. To validate the model, two planar antenna arrays are designed by following the proposed procedure. This results in a uniform induced voltage profile under the misaligned Rx condition and, hence, resolves the problem. The antenna designs are simulated, fabricated, and measured.

However, this O(N2) ULA segment of such configurations (e.g., minimum-/low-redundancy arrays (MRAs/LRAs), nested arrays, and coprime arrays as well as their variations) is inevitably susceptible to sensor failures, which is a crucial issue concerning array robustness (or system reliability) in practical applications. In this article, we present a novel sparse array geometry, named multiple-fold redundancy array (MFRA), by exploiting element redundancies in the difference coarray. The MFRA is not only more robust to sensor failures than the conventional minimum-/low-redundancy, nested, and coprime arrays but also can enjoy up to O(N2) DOF as these conventional arrays do. To efficiently construct MFRAs with desirable characteristics (including multiple-fold redundancy, satisfactory DOF, and hole-free difference coarray), a systematic design method is developed. Based on this method, some analytical structure patterns are derived for closed-form geometric construction. Several important properties of MFRAs are proved theoretically, and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate their characteristics and superior performances.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3083819","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901244,61790551,61925106); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M660643); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445596","Degrees of freedom (DOF);difference coarray;geometry design;multiple-fold redundancy;robustness;sensor failures;sparse arrays","Sensor arrays;Sensors;Redundancy;Robustness;Array signal processing;Microwave antenna arrays;Linear antenna arrays","","10","","57","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Element rotation can be equivalently achieved by altering the biasing voltage and changing the electromagnetic behavior of the reflective phasing cell. The proposed design approach brings about simplification in element configuration, leading to a reduction in the number of required diodes by a factor of one half.

CP is achieved by placing a patch of just about square dimensions on the top of the V-slot with orthogonal but unequal arms. The unequal arm of the slot degenerates the fundamental mode at a slightly different frequency with a 90° phase difference occurring at the center frequency of each arm. Proper positioning of the patch on the top of the slot ensures excitation of CP.

To achieve a low-cost and low-profile solution, the leaky-wave antenna feeds are designed in printed circuit board and the lenses are made of plastic. The lenses are optimized in the near-field region of the feeds, with the goal of maximizing the array element aperture efficiency. The array performance obtained from the proposed approach is validated by full-wave simulations, showing a 27.5 dBi broadside gain at 28 GHz and a steering capability up to ±20° with 2 dB of scan loss. An antenna prototype was fabricated and measured. Measurement results are in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. The prototype antenna, at broadside, achieves a 20% relative BW and a gain of 26.2 dBi.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3069494","European Research Council Starting(grant numbers:ERC-2014-StG LAA-THz-CC,639749); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395366","Fifth generation (5G);leaky-wave antenna (LWA);lens antenna;millimeter wave;sparse phased array antenna (PAA)","Antenna arrays;Lenses;Phased arrays;Gain;Feeds;Antenna radiation patterns;5G mobile communication","","40","","32","IEEE","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

TCDA1 of the unit cell acts as either a lossless (or lossy) antenna when the frequency is out of (or in) the operating frequency range of TCDA2. Reciprocity is applied to design TCDA1 as an absorber when the frequency is out of the operating frequency range of TCDA2 (lossless antenna region).

By controlling the reverse bias voltage of the embedded varactor, the transmission band in FSA-T mode can be tuned from 3.76 to 4.26 GHz with a very low insertion loss in the range of 0.62-0.95 dB.

According to the divergence-free condition of electric displacement vector, a kind of edge basis functions defined in elements including boundary faces which separate a dielectric object from the background is derived. As a result, we get a SWG-Edge hybrid basis set. Details for the calculation of the corresponding matrix elements for the edge basis and testing functions are presented. Numerical results show the validity and accuracy of the hybrid discretization scheme. Finally, the proposed method is used for efficient solution of VIE for inhomogeneous dielectric objects with multiboundary. It is shown that for multiboundary problems, the number of unknowns of the hybrid basis is only about 71% of the traditional SWG basis. This means that the memory for solution of VIE by the traditional SWG basis functions can be reduced by half.

In its standard form, the TLOPs exhibit some directivity but with strong sidelobes and the integration needs to consider the entire spectra. Windowed and Gaussian-beam (GB) TLOPs with improved directivity and reduced sidelobes have been considered in order to reduce the integration effort.

The modal equations for transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarized guided modes are delivered using surface impedance boundary conditions. By evaluating the reflection coefficients of the upper and lower waveguide boundaries, formulas for the modal equation's roots are derived. Analytical expressions for propagable mode parameters, such as the phase velocity, attenuation rate, excitation factor, and the field strength for different components, are obtained, and the cutoff frequency for high-order modes is given. Computations show that the field component curves exhibit typical peaks and nulls associated with multiple-mode propagation in the waveguide region, with each mode traveling at different phase velocities and attenuation rates.

The essential idea of physical layer transmission is to maximize the randomness of undesired channels. The 4-D antenna arrays formed by introducing time as the fourth controlling degree of freedom can be used to regulate the radiated fields in space, time, and frequency domains simultaneously. Thus, 4-D antenna arrays are an effective carrier for achieving physical layer secure transmission. However, the traditional secure transmission approach based on 4-D antenna arrays always inevitably leads to high sidelobe levels (SLLs) of radiated power or less channel randomness. Aimed at this problem, a novel physical layer secure transmission approach based on 4-D antenna arrays is proposed, which combines the advantages of traditional phased arrays and 4-D arrays. The approach can be used to reduce the SLL of radiated power and improve the channel randomness by optimizing the time sequences and static amplitude weighting. Moreover, the signal distortion caused by time modulation can be compensated in the desired direction by premodulating the transmitted signals. Both the numerical and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060056","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631006,61721001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362297","4-D antenna array;beamforming;directional modulation;physical layer security;premodulation","Antenna arrays;Modulation;Phased arrays;Receivers;Eavesdropping;Array signal processing;Amplitude modulation","","26","","30","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We demonstrate that a dynamic antenna array can synthesize spatial frequency filters, and that scene classification can be accomplished using the filtered signals without full image reconstruction. We develop a new dynamic antenna array concept using only two antennas to generate a ring-shaped spatial frequency filter and explore the use of this concept for the classification of ground scenes. Natural ground scenes tend to have smoother spatial frequency signals, while, in contrast, features such as buildings and roadways result in sharp broadband spatial frequency responses. Using this design, we demonstrate the ability to classify between two classes of ground scenes: those with man-made structures (buildings, roads, etc.) and those without (natural scenes).

By simultaneously varying the prisms' size and slot radius, the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth (ARBW) improves. The ARBW is further improved by replacing the circular slot with an elliptical slot. As a result, the ARBW increases from 1.0% to 10.3% without complicating the antenna structure and without enlarging the antenna size. Besides, the antenna still operates at two degenerate modes to introduce stable radiation gain and pattern. In addition, the proposed CP slot antenna features a wide ARBW. The final measurement shows that the proposed CP antenna can achieve a 9.5% bandwidth, a stable gain of 7.65 dBic ± 0.15 dBic, and higher than 140° ARBWs in a wide frequency range. The peak total radiation efficiency and aperture efficiency are about 97% and 91%, respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3061116","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071306); Shenzhen Science and Technology Programs(grant numbers:JCYJ20180305124543176,JCYJ20190728151457763); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018A030313481); Shenzhen University Research Startup Project of New Staff(grant numbers:860-000002110311); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9366329","Cavity-backed slot antenna (CBSA);circularly polarized (CP);full metal;high-efficiency;wide axial ratio (AR) beamwidth;wideband","Bandwidth;Slot antennas;Resonant frequency;Antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna feeds;Radar antennas","","23","","28","IEEE","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eight stepped-impedance slots are fed by a one to eight T junction power divider with equal amplitudes and phases. On the other hand, the vertically polarized (VP) omnidirectional radiation is realized by using the characteristics of the TM0n mode of the cylindrical cavity, where eight shorting copper sheets are used to excite TM01 and TM02 modes.

A key feature is the much reduced number of metallic layers and, therefore, the complexity of the array, as compared with other competitive designs. With the reduced antenna profile, high cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and low sidelobe level (SLL) are still achieved by a combination of techniques. The back cavity of the 2 ×2 slot subarray is optimized to confine the H-field along the direction of the radiation slots, enhancing its XPD. Stubs are loaded in the same cavity to compensate for the phase imbalance, suppressing both cross-polarization and grating lobes without introducing additional metallic layers. Combining these features, the proposed array antenna demonstrates high performance with only three essential metallic layers. A prototype with 8 ×8 radiation slots at the Ka-band is implemented for demonstration. Experimental results show that the grating lobes are suppressed to below -30.5 dB, and the first SLL (FSLL) of less than -26.2 dB. XPD of more than 31.3 dB is achieved over the frequency range of 26.5-32 GHz.

By conforming the array into a circular shape, the horn array covers full 360° azimuth range with 12 beams. Every adjacent beam overlaps each other at the half-power beam shoulders. A wideband matching is obtained with -10 dB reflection coefficients from 27.5 to 38 GHz. By suppressing the side-lobe levels to be lower than -20 dB, the mutual coupling between each SIW horn is less than -45 dB from 28 to 38 GHz. With a thin radiating aperture of 0.1 6λ, a stable realized gain of each beam is achieved around 9.5 dBi, whereas it increases to 12.9 dBi when there is a conducting reflector closely beneath it. Due to the reflector, the main radiation directions tilt 30°, which enables the proposed multibeam antenna to be mounted on the ceiling while maintaining the communication for multiple users below. Results with a manufactured prototype well demonstrate the multibeam performance both in simulation and measurement with good agreement.

The metamaterial structure integrated into each antenna element allows a low-profile height of 17.2 mm ( λ1.597/10.9). Since the curl element has wideband characteristics, the array is able to provide shared aperture functionality. The array guarantees high-gain beam steering for low elevation angles (up to θ = 70° from the zenith) with an average gain of 7.96 dBic at θ = 70°. In comparison, to achieve an equivalent high gain a conventional 4 × 5 patch array would be required (three elements versus 20 elements). This means that the proposed array requires 80% fewer phase shifters, amplifiers, and low-noise amplifiers (LNAs).

Even though many electromagnetic (EM) inverse scattering problems are solved on sparse investigation domains, GPAs have rarely been used for this purpose. This is because 1) they require a priori knowledge of the sparsity level in the investigation domain, which is often not available in EM imaging applications and 2) the EM scattering matrix does not satisfy the restricted isometric property. In this work, these challenges are, respectively, addressed by 1) using an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the sparsity level and 2) adding a Tikhonov regularization term to the diagonal elements of the scattering matrix. These enhancements permit the compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm to be efficiently used to solve the 2-D EM inverse scattering problem, which is linearized using the Born approximation, on spatially sparse investigation domains.

This parameter is classically estimated based on the variation of the in-phase and quadrature (IQ) channels in the time domain. This communication introduces a generalization of the RCS backscattered by a tag and a new definition of the delta RCS in the frequency domain. The analytical model is based on stochastic processes and allows to estimate the delta RCS from the power spectral density of the modulated signal backscattered by the tag. The associated measurement is compared to the classical time-domain-based methods. Results show a good agreement with a difference between the different approaches less than 0.5 dB. Finally, the proposed method relies on simple synchronization between the emitter and the receiver to estimate the delta RCS while maintaining the accuracy.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3060943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364852","Electromagnetic scattering;loaded antennas;modulation;radar cross section;radio frequency identification","Modulation;Frequency-domain analysis;Antennas;Time-domain analysis;Synchronization;Scattering;Antenna measurements","","26","","10","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed extension is based on an alternative scheme for the expansion of the EM field inside a gyrotropic medium, namely, a discrete eigenfunction (DE) expansion in terms of spherical vector wave functions (SVWFs). This approach provides the transition matrix (namely, T-matrix) that allows not only for the direct computation of the scattered field from the incident one, but also for the determination of the complex resonances of open (i.e., situated in free space) gyrotropic BoR resonators. The EBCM is validated on two levels: first, by calculating the EM scattering from various BoRs, including anisotropic spheroids, cylinders, and rods, and comparing with HFSS commercial software; second, by computing the complex eigenfrequency spectrum of gyroelectric spheroidal resonators and comparing with a recently developed rigorous technique for the EM modeling of anisotropic spheroids.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3069589","DAAD program “Studies on generalized multipole techniques and the method of auxiliary sources, with applications to electron energy loss spectroscopy.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395390","Cavities;complex resonances;gyrotropic;resonators;scattering;transition matrix","Manganese;Resonators;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Ferrites;Tensors;Computational modeling","","9","","30","IEEE","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
