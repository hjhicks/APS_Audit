The conventional SIW horn antenna suffers from narrow-operating bandwidth, which mainly results from the mismatch at the horn aperture between the substrate and the free space. However, the detachment of the broad walls makes the left substrate not only act as wave-guiding structure but also impedance transformer, which brings much size reduction in comparison with conventional SIW horn antenna. Moreover, the substrate with graded dielectric constants distributed in the propagating direction is realized through perforating air-vias with different diameters to further improve the radiation performance. Results indicate that the proposed antenna operates from 17.7 to 26.7 GHz with a nearly constant peak-radiating gain between 8 and 9 dBi at end-fire direction. Stable end-fire radiation patterns can be realized in the whole operating band.

It is found that by simultaneous excitation of both resonant modes, high gain and low sidelobe level (SLL) can be obtained in the radiation patterns. Excitation is done using a single coaxial feed. The fundamental working principle of the antenna is based on the superposition of radiated far fields of the TM11 and TM13 modes. At first, through a pattern synthesis, using different far field mode amplitude ratios, it is shown that the substrate dielectric constants can be selected for both layers such that it leads to low SLL. Next, for practical antenna design, the mode excitation, input impedance, and radiation properties of the TM13 mode are studied. For sound understanding and explanation, the edge voltage ratio at the aperture and mode amplitude ratio in the far field are calculated and their effects on SLL and peak directivity are discussed.

Steering the beam of LWAs in steps at a fixed frequency, using binary switches, is investigated, and a new half-width microstrip LWA (HW-MLWA) is presented. The basic building block of the antenna is a reconfigurable unit cell, switchable between two states. A macrocell is created by combining several reconfigurable unit cells, and the periodic LWA is formed by cascading identical macrocells. A prototype HW-MLWA was designed, fabricated, and tested to validate the concept. To achieve fixed-frequency beam scanning, a gap capacitor in each unit cell is independently connected or disconnected using a binary switch. By changing the macrocell states, the reactance profile at the free edge of the microstrip and hence the main beam direction is changed. The prototyped antenna can scan the main beam between 31° and 60° at 6 GHz.

Two sets of metallic pins are symmetrically placed along the two orthogonal diagonals of a square patch radiator at first. Due to the shunt inductive effect brought by these shorting pins, the resonant frequency of the dominant mode in this MPA is progressively tuned up so as to enlarge the electrical size of this pin-loaded patch resonator and to enhance its radiation directivity. After the optimal loading position is investigated for maximum directivity of linear polarization, one pair of the inner pins is slightly shifted in an offset to properly separate the two degenerate modes, so that the CP radiation can be excited. Moreover, upon request, either left-handed or right-handed circular polarization can be obtained by means of different position-offset scheme of the inner pins along the diagonals. After extensive analysis is executed, two equal-size CP MPAs with and without shorting pins are fabricated and tested. Simulated and measured results show good agreement and demonstrate that the CP directivity is enhanced from 8.0 (conventional MPA) to 10.8 dBic, indicating a 2.8-dB increment by means of the proposed approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2552544","Multi-Year Research Grant of the University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2014-00079-FST,MYRG2015-00010-FST); Science and Technology Development Fund Research Grant within the Macao Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:051/2014/A1); National Natural Science Foundation of China within the General Program(grant numbers:61571468); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7450661","Circular polarization;high-gain microstrip patch antennas;single-fed patch;shorting pins;Circular polarization;high-gain microstrip patch antennas (MPAs);shorting pins;single-fed patch","Pins;Resonant frequency;Patch antennas;Gain;Polarization;Loading","","130","","19","IEEE","11 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that this bandwidth gap is largely independent of the formed beam angle, number of array elements, array layout, and element radiation patterns.

Efficient and readily available sparse recovery algorithms can then be applied to identify the failures from a small number of measurements compared to standard diagnosis techniques and hence speed up the diagnosis. More specifically, three regularization procedures namely the minimization of the ℓ1, total variation (TV), and the mixed ℓ1/ℓ2 norm are used to solve the ill-posed array diagnosis problems. These approaches are compared to two standard fault identification techniques: the back-propagation algorithm (BPA) and the matrix inversion method for the diagnosis from simulated and measured data. The simulation of a 10 × 10 waveguide array in realistic conditions of noise and taking into account the potential scaling factor between two measurements is first presented.

A low-complexity antenna selection algorithm is then proposed to select the optimal subset until the suitable performance is obtained with condition that the spacing between adjacent two antennas is fixed. The combined effect of reducing the distance between the antenna elements with increasing the number of elements in a very limited physical space is also investigated. The antenna array consisting of dipole antennas placed side by side in a linear pattern is assumed. The convergence speed of the adaptive algorithm by bounding and estimating the eigenvalues of its signal covariance matrix in the presence of the mutual coupling is further evaluated. Some novel theoretical study which may be very valuable for the actual deployment of the large-scale adaptive array antennas is made in comparison with previous studies.

The present design has the advantages of compact size, simple feed networks, low cross polarization, and high isolation. The radiating elements are dual linearly polarized (LP) equilateral triangular patches with hybrid feeds. The vertical polarization (VP) of the patch antenna is obtained by using an aperture-coupled feed and the horizontal polarization (TIP) is obtained by using a proximity feed. These two feeds are orthogonally positioned and are printed on different PCB layers, which leads to the high isolation between these two ports and facilitates the design of the feed networks. The array antenna consists of six such dual-LP triangular patches sequentially rotated by 60° and fed by separated feed networks. Since LP antenna elements are used, the design of the feed network is much simplified. Through sequentially varying the feeding phase by ±60°, dual circular polarizations are obtained. The operation principle of the array antenna is also analytically explained in this paper. To verify the design concept, one dual LP equilateral triangular patch and one dual CP equilateral triangular patch array resonating at 10.5 GTIz are designed, fabricated, and tested. There is a good agreement between the simulation and measurement results, both of which show that the array antenna exhibits high port isolation and good circular polarizations with low cross polarization at different planes.

Array antennas with element spacing greater than one wavelength will produce grating lobes. Grating lobes are not a big problem in most new millimeter-wave applications, except for the fact that they reduce the aperture efficiency and thereby normally the directivity. When the element pattern is known, the simple formula can be used to calculate the aperture efficiency in the presence of grating lobes. The formula is verified by the simulations of a large uniformly excited planar slot array. The agreement is good for both broadside radiation and a phased main beam, even if we use the far field of an isolated slot. Using the far field of the embedded slot element gives almost the same results, except when a grating lobe radiates along the ground plane and the isolated element pattern is nonzero in this direction.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2551259","European Research Council (ERC)(grant numbers:321125); Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448404","aperture efficiency;array antenna;grating lobe;Aperture efficiency;array antenna;grating lobe","Gratings;Phased arrays;Aperture antennas;Planar arrays;Arrays","","29","","14","IEEE","6 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The expression is found by using the Fourier principles associated with convolution integrals, autocorrelation integrals, Parseval's Identity, and the Helmholtz operator in one dimension. Knowledge of the exact radiated power is used to find the expressions for directivity and radiation resistance. Furthermore, we show that the efficiency of the line source is explicitly a function of the relative proportion of two autocorrelation integrals. This newly developed theory is validated by considering large and small argument approximations in which closed-form results are readily known. Additional validation is obtained by comparing the exact result with the data obtained from numerical integration of the power pattern function. Examples associated with the half-wave dipole, cosine distribution, cosine-squared distribution, generalized dipole, triangular distribution, and the uniform distribution are provided. Other than the half-wave and generalized dipole solutions, we believe that the expressions obtained in this investigation have never been reported in the open literature.

The launcher radiates an electric field whose normal or longitudinal component takes the form of a zeroth-order Bessel function. The nondiffractive behavior of the structure in a well-defined area close to the radiating aperture is analyzed by decomposing the radiated field in its geometrical optics (GO) and diffractive (D) contributions. A closed-form expression is provided for the GO contribution whereas an asymptotic approximation is provided for the diffractive part. Such theoretical analysis allows a precise definition of the nondiffractive region for the generated Bessel beam. At the same time, it also highlights and predicts the oscillating behavior of the longitudinal component of the electric field along the z-axis due to the diffraction from the edges of the aperture. The proposed analysis is validated by a prototype at 30 GHz made by a radial waveguide loaded with metallic gratings and centrally fed by a coaxial probe. Measurement results for the longitudinal component of the electric field are in excellent agreement with full-wave results. In addition, the nondiffractive behavior for the radiated beam is reported over a bandwidth larger than 6.5% around 30 GHz.

The expression is valid for the dominant TM surface wave (SW) until the limit of the Floquet-Bloch (FB) region and generalizes our previous formulation to arbitrary direction of propagation.

As hyperbolic systems, both the MTEs and the Maxwell’s equations are solved by the discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method.

However, the Galerkin method requires the computation of double surface integral over pairs of triangles. There are many semianalytical methods to treat these integrals, which all have some issues and are discussed in this paper. Novel methods inspired by the treatment of these kernels in the fast multipole method are presented for computing all the integrals that arise in the Galerkin formulation to any accuracy. Integrals involving completely geometrically separated triangles are nonsingular, and are computed using a technique based on spherical harmonics and multipole expansions and translations, which require the integration of polynomial functions over the triangles. Integrals involving cases where the triangles have common vertices, edges, or are coincident are treated via scaling and symmetry arguments, combined with automatic recursive geometric decomposition of the integrals.

The classical work by Saleh and Valenzuela and many recent measurements show that multipath component (MPC) arrivals in CIRs appear at the receiver in clusters. To parameterize the CIR model, the first step is to identify clusters in CIRs, and a clustering algorithm is thus needed. However, the main weakness of the existing clustering algorithms is that the specific model for the cluster shape is not fully taken into account in the clustering algorithm, which leads to erroneous clustering and reduced performance. In this paper, we propose a novel CIR clustering algorithm using a sparsity-based method, which exploits the feature of the Saleh-Valenzuela (SV) model that the power of the MPCs is exponentially decreasing with increasing delay. We first use a sparsity-based optimization to recover CIRs, which can be well solved using reweighted ℓ1 minimization. Then, a heuristic approach is provided to identify clusters in the recovered CIRs, which leads to improved clustering accuracy in comparison to identifying clusters directly in the raw CIRs. Finally, a clustering enhancement approach, which employs the goodness-of-fit (GoS) test to evaluate clustering accuracy, is used to further improve the performance. The proposed algorithm incorporates the anticipated behaviors of clusters into the clustering framework and enables applications with no prior knowledge of the clusters, such as number and initial locations of clusters.

In this contribution, without modifying the modeling framework, we proposed a semi-deterministic channel modeling approach by associating the scatterers with realistic environment objects, and by calculating the coefficients of the propagation paths on the base of a physically sound and proven diffuse scattering theory. The diffuse multipath components are then combined with the specular components (SCs) simulated by ray-tracing (RT) to obtain a complete channel representation. The proposed method is evaluated in two reference scenarios at 3.8 and 60 GHz, respectively, by comparing the simulated channel characteristics with channel measurement data. Results show that the proposed method can accurately predict the channel characteristics in both the delay domain and the angular domain. The proposed approach is appropriate to model multipath propagation in confined indoor or dense-urban environment at millimeter (mm)-wave frequencies and above, where reverberation and rough-surface scattering can be important phenomena.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2546950","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471268); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442096","propagation channel modelling;diffuse scattering;millimeter wave;graph theory;ray-tracing;Diffuse scattering;graph theory;millimeter wave;propagation channel modeling;ray-tracing","Computational modeling;Scattering;Reverberation;Ray tracing;Graph theory;Delays;Radio propagation","","72","","26","IEEE","25 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is noticed that the proposed model has higher accuracy compared to existing analytical near-ground propagation models. This enhancement is achieved by careful assessment of key features relevant to near-grazing propagation such as diffraction loss due to obstruction of the first Fresnel zone and higher order waves produced by terrain irregularities.

The method is introduced to rigorously quantify the effect of random variations in the height and the permittivity of the substrate on the figures of merit of a textile antenna. Next, the joint height and permittivity probability distribution of a compressible substrate are characterized by means of a new measurement setup based on a resonant-perturbation technique. Finally, the method is validated for a probe-fed GPS textile antenna. It is shown that Hermite-Padé approximants model the highly nonlinear relationship between these substrate random variables and the figures of merit of the antenna more efficiently than the gPC. Moreover, a Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test proves that the resulting distributions of the antenna’s figures of merit are as accurate as those obtained by means of a Monte-Carlo (MC) analysis, with demonstrated speedup factors up to 123.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2543780","Inter-University Attraction Poles Program initiated by the Belgian Science Policy Office; Research Foundation Flanders; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436780","Textile antenna;polynomial chaos;Pad´e approximation;variability analysis;substrate compression;stochastic collocation;Padé approximation;polynomial chaos;stochastic collocation;substrate compression;textile antenna;variability analysis","Substrates;Permittivity;Antenna measurements;Stochastic processes;Microstrip antennas;Random variables","","23","","19","IEEE","18 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Determination of the best possible tradeoffs between conflicting objectives (a so-called Pareto front), such as reflection response, gain, and antenna size, is indispensable from the designer's point of view, yet challenging when high-fidelity electromagnetic (EM) simulations are utilized for performance evaluation. Here, a novel and computationally efficient methodology for multiobjective optimization of antenna structures is presented. In our approach, the tradeoff designs are obtained by moving along the Pareto front and identifying the subsequent Pareto-optimal solutions using surrogate-based optimization techniques. Computational efficiency of the process is achieved by employing coarse-discretization EM simulations and local response surface approximation (RSA) models. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a compact ultrawideband (UWB) monopole antenna with a representation of the Pareto front obtained at the cost corresponding to just a few dozen of evaluations of the high-fidelity EM antenna model.

Based on the analysis results, a method for recovering spectral information is proposed, the idea of which is to replicate the plane wave spectrum, and then apply a band-pass filter defined by a priori knowledge of the OUT size. For simplicity, the analysis is done in two-dimensional (2-D; range and cross-range dimensions). A simulation-based application is presented for validation purposes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2550035","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, Gobierno de España, National Research and Development Program(grant numbers:TEC2011-28683-C02-02,TEC 2014-54005-P,TEC 2014-55290-JIN); Spanish Government; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)(grant numbers:CN2012/279,CN2012/260); Galician Regional Government(grant numbers:CN2012/279,CN2012/260); Gobierno del Principado de Asturias(grant numbers:GRUPIN14-114); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7446315","Imaging Systems;Backpropagation;Fast Fourier Transform (FFT);Sparse Array;Multistatic radar system;Backpropagation;fast Fourier transform (FFT);imaging systems;multistatic radar system;sparse array","Imaging;Radar imaging;Receivers;Spectral analysis;Transmitters;Millimeter wave radar","","35","","13","IEEE","4 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, a monopolar antenna size is reduced by adding four symmetrical tapered slots on an edge-shorted patch. The antenna is first designed to be integrated onto a large flat ground plane that is applicable for vehicular installation. This design is later adapted for integration onto a helmet with a finite-curved ground plane, where the helmet material is included as part of the design. This study shows that a curved ground plane improves the radiation patterns at broadside and further reduces the antenna height. Both vehicle and helmet antennas have been optimized to operate in a wide frequency range from about 800-2300 MHz. These antennas radiate in a monopole-like pattern with vertical polarization and high radiation efficiency that makes them suitable for transmission applications. Good agreement between simulation and measurement is obtained, which ultimately validates the proposed design technique.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2551291","DST Group Cyber and Electronic Warfare Division (CEWD); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448390","Microstrip antennas;low-profile;monopole;wideband;omni-directional;vertical polarization;Low profile;microstrip antennas;monopole;omnidirectional;vertical polarization;wideband","Slot antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Resonant frequency;Broadband antennas;Wideband","","56","","17","IEEE","6 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As these terminals become more complex, smaller and more compact feeds that can be directly integrated with microstrip circuits are desirable. Standard microstrip antennas (MSAs) have unacceptably low radiation efficiency for use as reflector feeds. We show that the stacked shorted annular patch (SSAP) can be used as a replacement for horn feeds and achieves higher radiation and spillover efficiencies than conventional patch antennas due to the absence of distribution networks and dielectric substrates. Using a half-wavelength stacked patch as a director realizes a pattern that achieves high illumination efficiency with standard parabolic reflector geometries. Simulation and measurements show that the compact SSAP may be the first reported nonwaveguide feed antenna to achieve sensitivity comparable to that of a conventional horn feed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2551258","Research Grant from Linear Signal; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448407","Compact antenna feed;stacked shorted annular patch;antenna efficiency;satellite communications;Antenna efficiency;compact antenna feed;satellite communications;stacked shorted annular patch","Antenna feeds;Antenna measurements;Signal to noise ratio;Microstrip antennas;Satellite antennas;Microstrip","","32","","11","IEEE","6 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna operation relies on continuous moving of the liquid-metal volume over the capacitively coupled microstrip line feed network with a micropump unit. To maximize the capacitive coupling at the feed point, the antenna is realized by bonding microfluidic channel molds prepared in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer with 1-mil-thick liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrate. The concept is demonstrated through the design and experimentation of a 4:1 frequency-tunable monopole antenna that operates from 1.29 to 5.17 GHz. The presented monopole antenna can also be utilized as an element to form wideband frequency-tunable high-gain antenna apertures without necessitating any additional micropump units. This is accomplished by resorting to strategically meandered or interconnected microfluidic channels. This concept is demonstrated through the design and experimentation of a 4 × 1 microfluidically controlled monopole array capable of providing 2:1 frequency tuning range from 2.5 to 5 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2551358","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2106120000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448413","Frequency reconfigurable antenna;liquid metal;microfluidics;monopole;Frequency reconfigurable antenna;liquid metal;microfluidics;monopole","Metals;Liquids;Microfluidics;Feeds;Microstrip;Substrates","","106","","20","IEEE","6 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We study the convergence and accuracy of the DSEFIE also with respect to the current state of the art in the testing of the magnetic field integral equation. Examples of applications to large and realistic composite structures show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2552549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7450646","Dual surface;integral equations;method of moments;interior resonances;electromagnetic scattering;Dual surface;electromagnetic scattering;integral equations (IE);interior resonances;method of moments","Testing;Integral equations;Antennas;Surface waves;Geometry;Method of moments;Frequency modulation","","3","","30","IEEE","11 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
