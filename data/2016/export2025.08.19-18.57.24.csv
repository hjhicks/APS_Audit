This is due to computational problems associated with dielectric and magnetic materials. In particular, the symmetric form of the Poggio-Miller-Chan-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) surface formulation for the method of moments (MoM) solves for both external (real) and internal (nonreal) resonances of a structure. The external resonances are the characteristic modes (CMs), whereas the internal resonances are not. This paper proposes a new postprocessing method capable of providing unique and real CMs in all physical mediums, including lossy magnetic and dielectric materials. The method removes the internal resonances of a structure by defining a minimum radiated power, which is found through utilizing the physical bounds of the structure. The CMs found using the proposed method are verified through the use of an MoM volume formulation, time domain antenna simulations, and experiments involving multiple antenna prototypes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2539387","Vetenskapsrådet(grant numbers:2010-468,2012-4859); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7428860","Antenna design;characteristic modes (CMs);dielectric resonant antenna;MIMO systems;quality factor","Manganese;Method of moments;Antennas;Integral equations;Dielectrics;Impedance;Magnetic domains","","66","","39","IEEE","8 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the framework of coupled-mode theory, a method for decomposing a pair of characteristic modes into auxiliary modes is developed. The auxiliary modes have a degeneracy (eigenvalue crossing) and maintain continuity of modal current distributions through the coupling region of the original characteristic modes.

In many military applications, such HF antennas are mounted on relatively large metallic platforms. In this paper, we examine how a platform-mounted antenna can be used to excite the characteristic modes (CMs) of the platform itself to increase the overall bandwidth of the system. In this case, the platform will act as the main radiator and the mounted antennas act primarily as the coupling mechanism between the antenna and the external circuit. We use the theory of CMs to identify the appropriate platform modes and determine the practical means of exciting them. This allows for significantly increasing the bandwidth of the antenna system compared to the bandwidth of the antenna system in isolation. This approach is employed to enhance the bandwidth of a horizontally polarized HF loop antenna system by as much as 10 times compared to that of a stand-alone full-loop antenna. Scaled models of the proposed antennas were fabricated and experimentally characterized. Measurement results are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted results and demonstrate the feasibility of using the proposed approach in designing bandwidth-enhanced platform-mounted HF antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2543778","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-11-1-0618,N00014-15-1-2207,N00014-16-1-2098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436706","Antenna arrays;antenna feeds;characteristic modes (CMs);high-frequency (HF) antennas;mutual coupling","Bandwidth;Couplings;Current distribution;Antenna theory;Marine vehicles;Energy storage","","72","","32","IEEE","18 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By restricting our consideration to a class of symmetric antennas, the lowest order characteristic modes of a structure can be separated with practical decoupling networks, studied, and excited independently. We show that the quality factor of each characteristic mode effectively bounds the performance of any individual port excitation, and can be used to evaluate the fitness of the antenna for multiport excitation. Under this framework, we apply a genetic algorithm (GA) to synthesize low Q MIMO antennas while minimizing conductor area.

A set of mutually orthogonal RMs of the antenna system is constructed from superpositions of CMs of the chassis of the device. By exploitation of orthogonality properties and permutation relations between the couplers due to symmetry, the complexity of the matching network (MN) and the number of tunable reactances are reduced. The approach is applied to the design of a four-port antenna system for a femto-cell form factor device operating in the [470, 790] MHz range. We proceed to the computation of the CMs of the device, the selection of most efficient ones, and their excitation with couplers whose locations respect the symmetry of the structure and of the current density distributions of the chosen modes.

We develop a broadband multiport circuit model for the antenna impedance based on the excitation of each mode, where the feed locations only affect transformer ratios in the model, enabling design and analysis of arbitrary feed combinations over a wide frequency range. Because a CMT expansion can be computed for any planar geometry, the shape of the radiating element can also be arbitrary. While this approach is approximate, several examples are presented to demonstrate that its accuracy and flexibility make it suitable for various planar antenna design applications.

We propose a new expression for the total Q factor, which is independent of the excitation and based on the eigenvalues of the structure. The proposed expression is used to compute the Q factor of an arbitrary-shaped resonant antenna and shows excellent agreement with other expressions in the literature such as the ones proposed by Yaghjian, Best, and Gustafsson. The approach is then used to analyze small patch antennas over metamaterial and magnetodielectric substrates. It is shown using the defined Q factor expression that a magnetic substrate offers a significant bandwidth enlargement for the first active modes, and a dielectric substrate presents the opposite effect. This agrees with other works based on analytical approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a reactive impedance metamaterial substrate presents identical modal significances that are identical to a conventional magnetodielectric substrate when associated with a patch antenna.

These shapes were generated using a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model calibrated using realistic CNT shapes encountered experimentally. The analysis shows that the shape and orientation of CNTs has a strong effect on the scattered electromagnetic response. We used the theory of characteristic modes (TCM) to explain this dependence of the scattered electromagnetic waves on the shape of the CNT. Using TCM, we developed simplified but highly accurate formulas that link the shapes of the CNTs to the resonances in their total extinction coefficient spectrum.

The first method, resonant frequency (ResF), utilizes the existence of the four distinct ResFs, while the second one, dimensional invariance (DI), relies on the property of DI, for the design of the U-slot microstrip patch. In both these methods, the optimization of the probe location is necessary for further enhancement of the 10-dB return loss bandwidth. The third method, dimensionally invariant ResF, that optimally combines the features of the previous two is developed here and shown to yield better bandwidth performance with minimal or no probe location optimization, and hence is superior to the other two for rapid prototyping. CMA is carried out for critical parameters, such as substrate electrical thickness, slot width, probe radius, and feed location variations, to assess their dominant influence on the characteristics of the U-slot microstrip patch antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2556705","University of Missouri at Kansas City through the Inter-Disciplinary Inter-Campus Award Research Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457305","Characteristic modes (CMs);microstrip antennas;ultrawideband antennas","Substrates;Bandwidth;Resonant frequency;Patch antennas;Microstrip;Design methodology","","102","","45","IEEE","20 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
