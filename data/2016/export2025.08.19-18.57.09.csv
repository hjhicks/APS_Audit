The tag antenna has a rectangular radiating plate with a Z-shaped slot, which enables it to function like a half-wavelength slot resonator and a dipole-type ground radiator. A conjugate match to an Alien Higgs-3 chip with an impedance of 8 -j142 Ω at 925 MHz is obtained by etching a half-wavelength slot resonator in the center of the rectangular radiating plate (120 mm × 60 mm). The tag antenna resistance and inductive reactance can be matched to the desired chip impedance by simply tuning the length and width of the Z-slot resonator. The space between the half-wavelength resonant radiating plate (dipole-type ground radiator) and the metallic plane enhances the antenna gain by increasing the reflection from the metallic plane. A horizontal electric dipole placed above the perfectly flat electric metallic plane enables a maximum gain of 8.7 dBi over a short distance, which is fourfold higher than that of an isolated half-wavelength dipole. Tests of an RFID reader with an effective isotropic radiated power of 4.0 W showed that the maximum read coverage of the proposed tag antenna mounted on a metallic plane exceeded 10 m. Measurement data were in good agreement with the simulation results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2526047","National Science Council(grant numbers:NSC100-2221-E-151-054-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7399703","Dipole-type antenna;ground radiation antenna;RFID;Z-slot exciter;Dipole-type antenna;ground radiation antenna;radio-frequency identification (RFID);Z-slot exciter","Dipole antennas;Impedance;Radiofrequency identification;Slot antennas;Resonant frequency;Couplings","","48","","21","IEEE","5 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The operating frequency of the proposed antenna is tuned by physically rotating the two MS layers with respect to the centre of the slot antenna. Rotation of the MS layers changes the effective permittivity and the loading on the slot antenna and hence the operating frequency changes. The proposed antenna has a low profile with the thickness of the antenna including the two MS layers being 0.07λ0. The simulated and measured results show that using the proposed technique, the operating frequency can be tuned from 2.55 to 3.45 GHz with a fractional tuning range of around 28%.

The shorting pins are introduced in the centerline of a square patch to strengthen the surface current density near the feeding point at edge. As these paired pins simultaneously move away from the center toward the two radiating edges of patch, the resonant input impedance of the microstrip-edge-fed patch antenna is increasingly reduced due to enlarged current density at the feeding point. Because of symmetric arrangement of these two shorting pins, surface current density on the patch is maintained as the odd-symmetric property with respect to the H-plane, thus tremendously degrading the cross-polarization level. Simulated and measured results are found in good agreement with each other in terms of input impedance and radiation pattern. They further demonstrate that co-polarization to cross-polarization ratio (CTCR) of the paired-pins-loaded patch antenna in H-plane is maintained at least 10 dB higher than that of its single-pin-loaded patch counterpart.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2526079","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571468); Multi-Year Research(grant numbers:MYRG2015-00010-FST,MYRG2014-00079-FST); FDCT Research(grant numbers:051/2014/A1); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7399722","Cross polarization;edge-fed patch antenna;impedance matching;Cross polarization;edge-fed patch antenna;impedance matching;pin-loaded patch antenna;shorting pins","Patch antennas;Current density;Impedance;Pins;Surface impedance;Microstrip;Microstrip antennas","","80","1","18","IEEE","5 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The chip consists of a differentially fed antenna and a Schottky diode at its terminal. The passive structure of the Schottky diode is modeled into the antenna. To improve its performance, the detectenna (detector + antenna) chip is designed so that it can be mounted on the upper side of a Duroid substrate with a metal strip ring surrounding the chip. The ring is connected to the ground plane on the bottom of the substrate by vias to form a circular cavity. With the so-called circular cavity package, the radiation pattern of the antenna on the chip is not only converted from omnidirectional to unidirectional, but also with its surface wave well suppressed, the directivity of the antenna can increase, and hence improve its sensitivity. With this cavity, the isolation between adjacent elements can also be improved if it is used to build an array. The measured results show that a gain enhancement of 5.4-7.7 dB can be achieved within the operating bandwidth.

The prototyped antenna is capable of steering two symmetrical beams within a range of 37° when frequency is swept between 6.92 and 8.75 GHz. The measured peak gain of the antenna is 12.7 dBi and the variation of gain from 6.92 to 8.75 GHz is 3.1 dB.

It has been observed that measurements are highly influenced by the antenna placements and the ACP110-A-GSG-100 probe. To model the effect of air coplanar probe (ACP probe), a software calibration is performed similar to a network analyzer calibration, and then the antenna reflection coefficient is calculated using the modeled probe-fed antenna. The technique employs obtaining the probe ABCD matrix and then de-embedding from the simulation results to compare with measurements. The probe-fed simulated and measured reflection coefficients agree well for manufactured L and T antennas, which resonate at 86 and 81 GHz, respectively. There are resonance frequency shifts attributed to the ACP probe effect, and simulations show that antennas will operate at 79 GHz (L antenna) and 77 GHz (T antenna) in the absence of ACP probe.

A design procedure is presented, which can be used to determine the required number of elements and the excitation currents to achieve the specified radiation properties. For these arrays, the element currents always decrease monotonically from a maximum at the array center to a minimum value at edge elements. This property can be exploited to limit the current taper ratio (CTR) when the number of elements is very large. Simulation results indicate that these arrays can provide half-power beamwidths, directivities, and SLLs comparable to those of other desirable array choices, such as Chebyshev arrays, with the same number of elements and interelement spacings.

The CP MEdipole antenna fed by a transverse slot etched on the broad wall of a section of shorted-end substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) is convenient to integrate into substrates. An impedance bandwidth of wider than 28.8%, a wide 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 25.9%, and gain of 7.7 ± 1.4 dBic over the operating band are achieved. Additionally, since the CP radiation is generated by the combination of two orthogonal ME-dipole modes, the antenna element has stable unidirectional radiation patterns that are almost identical in two principle planes throughout the operating band, which is desirable to array applications. By employing the proposed CP ME-dipole as radiating elements, an 8 x 8 high-gain wideband planar antenna array is proposed for 60-GHz millimeter-wave applications. A fabrication procedure of using conductive adhesive films to bond all print circuit board (PCB) layers together is successfully implemented to realize the array design with a three-layered geometry, which has advantages of low costs and possibility of large-scale manufacture. The measured impedance bandwidth of the fabricated prototype is 18.2% for |S11| <; -10 dB. Because of the wide AR bandwidth of the new antenna element, a wide AR bandwidth of 16.5% can be achieved by this array without the use of sequential feed.

An efficient choice of macrobasis functions (MBFs) is applied to the antenna, which reduces the computational costs by several orders of magnitude. The calibration involves scanning a target of known constitution through the antenna near field, assigning a tuning parameter to each MBF and optimizing said parameters, so as to reduce the error between antenna simulations and measurements. This adjusts the antenna's simulated surface currents, so as to more accurately represent the currents on the experimental apparatus.

However, its numerical modeling process is extremely cost prohibitive due to the huge contrast between its thickness and other dimensions. In this work, for the first time, the EM features of graphene are characterized by a circuit model through the partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method. The atomically thick graphene is equivalently replaced by an impedance boundary condition. After incorporating the PEEC method, a novel surface conductivity circuit model is derived for graphene. A physical resistor and inductor are added into the conventional PEEC cell due to the dispersive conductivity property of graphene. The proposed novel method significantly reduces the memory and CPU time consumption for general graphene structures when compared with standard numerical finite element method (FEM) or finite difference (FD) methods, where 3-D meshing is unavoidable. This model also transforms the surface conductivity of graphene into a vivid circuit, and physical properties of the material can be conveniently obtained, such as radiation, scattering, and resistance properties, when compared with method of moments (MOM). In addition, the radiation and scattering calculation by MOM entail the cumbersome steps of defining a bounding surface and implementing a multidimensional integrand, while in PEEC, these complications are entirely bypassed by the concise vector-matrix-vector product (VMVP) formulas.

The evaluation was performed in LTE Band 18 Downlink (860-875 MHz) under realistic usage conditions of two measured user handgrips and simulated propagation channels with different angular spreads (ASs). The results provide potential performance gains from AIM based on realistic MIMO terminal prototypes, and the underlying mechanisms by which the gains were achieved, which can serve as antenna and AIM circuit design guidelines. In particular, the evaluation revealed that ideal uncoupled AIM networks can increase the capacity by up to 52% relative to 50-Ω terminations. However, the observed gains depend heavily on the antenna design, the user scenario, and the channel's AS. For example, the wideband design in different user cases experienced capacity gain of 4%-9% from AIM in uniform 3-D channels, in contrast to the 1.3%-44% gain seen in a conventional narrowband design. In nonuniform channels with small ASs, the AIM gain for different mean incident angles depends on the absolute mean effective gain (MEG) and the change in correlation due to AIM; in cases where AIM has little impact on correlation, the mean incident angles with high AIM gains were close to those with high MEGs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2521885","VINNOVA(grant numbers:2009-02969); Vetenskapsrådet(grant numbers:2010-468); IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393516","MIMO systems;impedance matching;antenna measurements;Antenna measurements;handset antennas and multipath channels;impedance matching;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","Antennas;MIMO;Antenna measurements;Impedance matching;Ports (Computers);Transmission line matrix methods;Correlation","","23","","38","IEEE","26 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As an alternative technique for implant wireless communication, we propose to use the human body itself as an antenna by feeding an RF current into the tissues. In particular, this paper studies the scenario when the RF current is fed by a tiny toriodal inductor that is implanted and clamped around the tissues in the ankle. The frequency range of 1-70 MHz is considered, which includes the resonance frequency of the human body. Theoretical results, from applying small toroidal inductors, show that the system exhibits broadband characteristics with a maximum gain of -25dB between 20 and 40 MHz, assuming an isotropic radiation from human body. However, for the case of the small toroidal inductors considered, the radiation resistance of the system is very small, which increases the power consumption. It is known that the radiation resistance can be further improved by choosing a magnetic core with high permeability and low loss, as well as, by optimizing the number of turns to reduce the parasitic capacitance and obtain a usable magnetizing inductance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2526070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7399705","human body;human body antenna;wireless implant communication;Cylindrical antenna;human body;human body antenna;monopole antenna;radiation efficiency;reflection coefficient;resonance frequency;three-term approximation;torodial inductor;wireless implant communication","Implants;Antennas;Inductors;Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Current density;Magnetic resonance","","23","","37","IEEE","5 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The RVD suffers from considerable reflection at the feeding transmission line at low frequencies because of its large negative input reactance. To reduce the reflection, a non-Foster matching network, which is composed of NICs based on operational amplifiers (op-amps), is proposed. For the practical design, the effects of input parasitic capacitances of the op-amp and the finite open-loop gain are considered. The stability analysis is performed according to the Barkhausen stability criterion. The non-Foster matching network is implemented with the RVD as a load. The measured impedance demonstrates that the matching network significantly reduces the input reactance of the RVD. In the time-domain analysis, the matched RVD is shown to reflect significantly less incident pulse. A target was imaged through a series of radar echo experiments. The images show that the non-Foster matching network enhances the performance of the RVD as an antenna for the ground-penetrating radar.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2513090","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2013M1A3A3A02042444); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368114","Negative impedance converter;non-Foster matching;impedance matching;resistively loaded vee dipole (RVD) antenna;Impedance matching;negative impedance converter (NIC);non-Foster matching;resistively loaded vee dipole (RVD) antenna","Impedance;Capacitance;Dipole antennas;Chlorine;Loaded antennas;Stability analysis","","16","","24","IEEE","29 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The 3-dB axial ratio band can be achieved by simply protruding a horizontal stub from the ground plane toward the center of the wide slot (WS) and then feeding the WS with a microstrip feedline positioned to the side of the WS, underneath the protruded stub. The feedline and metallic stub are perpendicular to each other, and they resemble a T shape when viewed from the top. The proposed antenna is fabricated with an area of 25 × 25 mm2.

It consists of a cavity excited by a transmission line and four SIW grooves that produce good reflection coefficient and enhanced gain. By designing corrugated structure using constructive superposition of electric fields of patch and grooves, the antenna with high performance in both bands is achieved. In the proposed structure, three simple printed circuit boards (PCBs) for implementing a resonant transmission line and specific SIW structures are employed instead of waveguide feeder and grooves on metallic plate in conventional corrugated antennas. Removing the metallic plate reduces the weight and cost of the structure and provides ease of fabrication. Dual-band characteristic is achieved using resonant slot (cavity) and resonant transmission line. Fabrication results show that the SIW grooves significantly increase the antenna gain with respect to the simple slot antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2526610","Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (AITF); TELUS Communication; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7400966","Aperture antenna;Corrugated structures;Dualband antenna;Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW);Aperture antenna;corrugated structures;dual-band antenna;substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW)","Cavity resonators;Antenna radiation patterns;Electric fields;Reflection coefficient;Dual band;Apertures","","36","","20","IEEE","8 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed solution allows to simultaneously generate two orthogonal circular polarizations that are combined to generate two orthogonal linear polarizations with polarization-tracking capabilities and very low cross-polarization level thanks to the symmetry of the structure. The antenna is composed of two interleaved slotted ridge waveguide arrays connected to a polarizer, realized with an array of triangular-base ridged cavities. Slots, located at the waveguide centerline, are excited by means of posts avoiding offsets and leading to a regular grid arrangement. Radiating elements are placed in a triangular lattice to minimize the azimuth sidelobe level and provide high EIRP levels.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2526645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7400945","Slot antennas;slot arrays;phased arrays;dualpolarized antennas;polarization tracking;Dual-polarized antennas;phased arrays;polarization-tracking;slot antennas;slot arrays","Arrays;Polarization;Cavity resonators;Slot antennas;Antenna arrays;Lattices","","38","","12","IEEE","8 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Application of the model to a variety of different propagation conditions demonstrates that the secure and available key rates differ appreciably when the K-factor is large or when the separation between the eavesdropper and one of the legitimate nodes is small.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2526681","U.S. Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-12-1-0469); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7400957","MIMO systems;Covariance matrices;Security;Covariance matrices;cryptography;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems;security","Computational modeling;Channel estimation;Manganese;Antenna radiation patterns;Analytical models;Encryption","","1","","16","IEEE","8 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
