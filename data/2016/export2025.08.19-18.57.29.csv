The chip is configured with one transmitting and two receiving antennas. A high antenna efficiency and isolation between the transmitting and receiving antennas is achieved by using a cavity-backed on-chip monopole and by optimizing the package environment. Surface-wave losses and back radiation are reduced, and a high antenna gain is obtained with small ripples in the antenna pattern by implementing special structures on the PCB of the integrated circuit package. The experimental results from the single-chip radar show that the on-chip antennas provide a gain of 2 dBi with very low back radiation. The realized antennas achieve an impedance bandwidth of more than 50% with a corresponding simulated efficiency of 45%.

The antenna is fabricated using a copper-cladded substrate. A radiating patch with an inverted rectangular T-slot is etched on the top side of the substrate. A straight rectangular strip with a complete gap is embedded into the T-slot. By placing a single varactor diode across this gap, a frequency-agile band-notch function below 5 GHz is realized. On the bottom side of the substrate, a U-shaped parasitic element having an interdigitated-structure is placed beneath the radiating patch. The second narrow band notch is created by inserting a second varactor diode into the gap on one leg of the parasitic element. It has a frequency-agile performance above 5 GHz. The presence of the interdigitated structure suppresses higher order resonant modes and enhances the tunability of the notched bandwidth. Because these antenna structures naturally block dc, a very small number of lumped elements are required. The experimental results, which are in good agreement with their simulated values, demonstrate that both band notches can be independently controlled and the entire frequency-agile fractional bandwidth is as high as 74.5%, demonstrating a very wide notched frequency-agile coverage.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2570254","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:106112015CDJZR165510); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471072,91438104,61571069); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7471453","Band-notch filters;frequency agile;frequency tunable;planar antennas;ultrawideband (UWB) antennas","Ultra wideband antennas;Varactors;Optical switches;Substrates;Impedance;Cognitive radio","","66","","45","IEEE","18 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Four metallic pins are symmetrically placed in the two diagonals of a square patch resonator to electrically short the patch and ground plane. These shorting pins tremendously perturb the field distribution beneath the patch due to their shunt inductive effect. As these four pins are moved outward along the two orthogonal diagonals away from the center, their influence on the field distribution over the patch is strengthened to gradually raise its dominant mode, i.e., TM010 mode, resonant frequency as the pin-to-pin spacing is enlarged. At a fixed resonant frequency, the overall area of this proposed patch antenna with four pins results to be increased. As such, its radiation directivity or gain gets to be enhanced due to the enlarged antenna area. After extensive analysis is executed, two square patch antennas with and without loaded pins are designed and fabricated. The simulated and measured results agree with each other, and they have evidently demonstrated that the radiation directivity can be enhanced up to 11.0 dBi, or about 2.9 dB increment, by virtue of the proposed approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2573860","Multi-Year Research Grants(grant numbers:MYRG2015-00010-FST,MYRG2014-00079-FST); University of Macau; FDCT Research(grant numbers:051/2014/A1); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571468); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7480402","Field perturbation;gain enhancement;microstrip patch antenna;shorting pins","Patch antennas;Pins;Resonant frequency;Gain;Periodic structures;Antenna radiation patterns","","174","","30","IEEE","27 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that by nonperiodic positioning of MNG unit cells on the loop structure, the amplitude of the surface current can be modified in a desired section of the loop, and hence, unidirectional radiation is achievable at the mu-zero resonance frequency. Moreover, it is demonstrated that as a result of the capacitive MNG loading, a 90° phase difference occurs between the vertical arms of the loop. Therefore, its radiation mechanism can be characterized as an array of two dipole antennas positioned a quarter wavelength apart, thus creating unidirectional radiation. To further improve the performance of the antennas, a quarter-wavelength strip is located in the vicinity of the loop to act as a resonator and director at higher frequencies. With the proposed structure, the final design is at least 50% smaller, in terms of the occupied area, than recent antenna designs of conventional loops, MNG loaded loops, and loop-dipole composite antennas. It also achieves a wide fractional bandwidth of 52% from 0.64 to 1.1 GHz, which is 50% wider than recent MNG metamaterial unit cell loaded loops, with a measured peak front-to-back-ratio and gain of 13 dB and 4.8 dBi, respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2574878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482778","Dipole antenna;loop antenna;metamaterial antenna;mu-negative (MNG) transmission line;mu-zero resonance (MZR) antenna;quasi-Yagi antenna","Dipole antennas;Loading;Metamaterials;Capacitors;Loaded antennas;Resonant frequency","","40","","34","IEEE","1 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It consists of two 1 × 6 subarrays arranged side by side, which are designed for Digital Cellular System (DCS: 1710-1880 MHz) and Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA: 1920-2170 MHz) applications. The two subarrays are composed of filtering antenna elements with high in-band radiation efficiency and out-of-band radiation rejection levels. The radiation of the DCS subarray is suppressed in the WCDMA band and vice versa. Mutual coupling between the two subarrays, therefore, can be suppressed and high isolation can be obtained with reduced subarray spacing. For demonstration, a dual-band filtering antenna array is designed and fabricated. The overall width of the array is only 206 mm, which is much narrower than that of typical industrial products (~290 mm). An isolation of 35 dB is obtained between the two subarrays without any decoupling network. The measured antenna gains are about 14.2 and 14.5 dBi for DCS and WCDMA bands, respectively, and the 3-dB beamwidths of the horizontal radiation patterns are 65° ± 5°. In addition, null filling below the main beam in the vertical radiation patterns is realized by elaborately designing a feed network to manipulate the output magnitude and phase of each array element. The proposed array is suitable for potential base station applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2574872","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61422106,61327005); National Engineering Technology Research Center for Mobile Ultrasonic Detection; National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals; Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2016A050503018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482792","Base station antenna array;dual band;filtering antenna;mutual coupling","Filtering;Antenna arrays;Gain;Multiaccess communication;Spread spectrum communication;Mutual coupling","","230","","22","IEEE","1 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that an excited element in array environment produces a number of space and leaky wave modes (but no surface wave mode) that can be expressed in terms of branch-cut integrals and residues, respectively, in the complex wavenumber plane. The dominant space wave mode has a very sharp radiation pattern with large phase variation near its peak causing constructive and destructive interferences with the primary pattern of the excited element within a small angular region. As a result, the AEP exhibits sharp dips that are very close to the local peaks. The number and the extent of excited modes that cause interference depend on the location of the excited element in a finite array. Consequently, the shape of the AEP changes with the element location. It is found that an array generates forward and backward waves on its aperture, and for element spacing less than one wavelength, the backward wave dominates. As a result, the AEP for the left-edge element has a dip at the left-hand side of the boresight and the beam tilts toward the left. For large element spacing, multiple dips may occur on both sides. The present analysis explains several interesting characteristics of finite and infinite arrays and very closely agrees with the plane wave spectrum model.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2578305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7487037","Active element pattern (AEP);branch-cut integral;edge element pattern;finite array;Floquet modal theory;leaky wave;space wave","Finite element analysis;Apertures;Electric fields;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays;Surface waves;Shape","","2","","29","IEEE","8 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They have been achieved by applying the unified theory of spiral scannings for nonvolumetric antennas and adopting either an oblate ellipsoid or a double bowl to shape an antenna with a quasi-planar geometry. By using these modelings, instead of the spherical one, it is possible to significantly reduce the error due to the truncation of the scanning zone, since the NF data can be acquired on a spiral lying on a plane located at a distance smaller than one half of the antenna maximum size.

The main challenges of this paper include: 1) the integration of these algorithms for layered medium and 2) the higher order computational approach involved in layered medium for high efficiency. In the proposed method, the MoM with the layered medium dyadic Green's function is used as the exact radiation boundary condition in an inhomogeneous background, and the FEM is applied to model the inhomogeneous objects. Furthermore, the higher order maximally orthogonal basis functions with curl-conforming and divergence-conforming properties are used in the FEM and MoM, respectively to improve the modeling capability of this algorithm. For 3-D inhomogeneous objects scattering in multilayered medium, this new method requires a much more tightly truncated simulation domain than the traditional FEM, and provides much higher flexibility than the pure surface integral equation method.

The Dirichlet transmission condition (DTC) employed at the interface between FEM and BI domains has faster convergence than the Robin-type transmission condition, and this finding is different from the conclusions for the FEM DDMs published in the literature. Furthermore, the cement-element (CE)-based dual-primal finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI-DP) DDM has faster convergence than the Lagrange-multiplier-based FETI-DP method under the FE-BI system, and is also different from that under the system of the FEM with the absorbing boundary condition (FEM-ABC).

As a numerical technique, the formal level-set method (LSM) can retrieve the shape and position of objects, using synthetic/measurement data. In general, the constitutive parameters of an object (e.g., its relative complex permittivity) are among the a priori information needed for the LSM. For MLSM, an evolution strategy is proposed to simultaneously calculate both the shape and complex permittivity of a 2-D object. The initial guesses in respect of the complex permittivity and shape of the target object converge on their real values as the cost function is minimized. The cost function is regularized with two penalty terms. To prevent sudden change in the shape of the object, a curvature-based regularization is used. Also, Laplacian regularizer is used to reduce fluctuations in the object's constitutive parameters during the process. Using different synthetic data sets, the capabilities of MLSM in microwave imaging and parameter estimation are evaluated. It is found that, using MLSM, it is possible to completely separate two adjacent objects, separated by a distance of one-fifteenth of a wavelength. The proposed method can retrieve targets of different relative permittivities, with less than 10% error. One interesting feature of this method is its high fidelity in retrieving the immersed one-tenth-wavelength targets in highly contrasting (up to as high as 8:1) domains. In the case of targets with little contrast (10%), the proposed method, with more iterations, can converge on a value, which is 57% more than the actual value. These features are valuable in distinguishing malignant tissue from normal tissue.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2582961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7496937","Inverse scattering problem;level-set method (LSM);microwave imaging","Shape;Permittivity;Level set;Mathematical model;Cost function;Imaging;Iterative methods","","6","","43","IEEE","21 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These phenomena include nonlinearity of the medium, power of the scattered waves, power of the dominant components, and number of multipath clusters. They are mapped onto physical parameters, and apart from the first one, which is assumed to influence only the resulting signal envelope, the others affect independently its in-phase and quadrature components. Imbalance parameters are then introduced so as to better assess the impact of these phenomena on the entire process. The signal is described by means of its envelope and phase probability density functions (pdfs). To this end, complex-based and envelope-based models are proposed and explored. An exact joint envelope-phase pdf is found in the closed form. The marginal statistics in these cases remain in the integral forms. Interestingly, the envelope density function obtained through the envelope-based model is found to compute more efficiently than that obtained through the complex model. In addition, capitalizing on the results in the literature, exact series-expansion formulations are found for the envelope pdf as well as for the envelope cumulative distribution function. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is probably the most general and unifying, physically based, complex fading model proposed in the literature. Because of its comprehensiveness, a number of issues remain open and constitute a fertile field for investigation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2570235","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico(grant numbers:304248/2014-2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7471410","Fading model;short-term fading;wireless channel","Wireless communication;Computational modeling;Probability density function;Antennas;Rayleigh channels","","94","","53","IEEE","18 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reach this goal, three on-body antenna positions (head, belt, and wrist) and multiple human mobility scenarios have been investigated in the measurements. The characterization of these channels shows that not only channel gain is affected by mutual body orientation, but also short and long term fading are.

Our approach, however, differs from the FCC one in the sense that the proposed geolocation database is not limited to process terrain information based on antenna height above average terrain (HAAT). Our primary contour prediction (PCP) algorithm processes detailed regional topographic data with the Fresnel diffraction theory while allowing flexibility in conservativeness to accommodate local regulations. This renders more realistic contour predictions in regions of rough terrain. Moreover, due to the current broadcast antenna height limitation of 200 m in existing propagation models, we revisit the work of Okumura et al. and derive a new model applicable to a broader antenna height range. Specifically, we utilize $n$ th order polynomials to fit Okumura curves in the least-square sense and obtain remarkable accuracy with low orders, i.e., $n = 3$ . As a result, contours of broadcasters as high as 1000 m are easily predicted in regions ranging from quasi-flat to mountainous with the proposed geolocation database, which is composed of the novel yet simple propagation model and the PCP algorithm based on the diffraction theory. Finally, we perform an extensive analysis of TV WS (TVWS) spectrum availability in Japan based on NASA topography data, demographic information from the Statistic Bureau of Japan, and broadcaster-related information obtained from the Japanese Ministry of Communications. This analysis suggests that HAAT-based techniques should not be utilized in countries with rough terrain due to HAAT inherent lack of sensitivity to detailed topography, which hinders the potential of TVWS technology. We also computed the TVWS availability considering all (more than 2000!) transmitters, translators, and boosters across Japan and adjacent channel restrictions as required per regulations. We found that processing detailed topographic data by diffraction-based algorithms almost triple the expected TVWS bandwidth compared with HAAT-based techniques in this country.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2580164","Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan, under a contract of R&D for Radio Resource Enhancement; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490347","Broadcaster contour;geolocation database;radio propagation model;TV white space (TVWS);white space (WS) radios","Antennas;Urban areas;Geology;Mathematical model;TV;White spaces;FCC","","5","","24","IEEE","13 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method is suitable for an accurate and efficient calculation of the propagation constants of waveguides filled with pieces of homogeneous materials. To apply the method, we first decompose the 2-D problem domain into a set of curved polygons of a specific characteristic. Then, we divide every polygon into a set of triangular elements with two straight edges. Finally, we introduce a set of hierarchical mixed-order curl-conforming vector basis functions inside every triangular element to discretize the vector wave equation. The advantages of the method are as follows. The curved boundaries of the elements are modeled exactly, and hence, there is no approximation in the geometrical modeling. The 2-D integrals of the matrix elements are reduced to 1-D integrals. Therefore, the matrix filling can be performed very fast. The total number of elements due to the discretization of a given domain is very small, and hence, the discretization of the problem domain takes up a very small percentage of the total computational time.

A low-sidelobe taper that is synthesized for those far-field directions of the AF belonging to only visible direction, cosine u-v space, can seriously deteriorate with respect to peak sidelobe level (PSLL) when the main beam is scanned or the operating frequency is raised. In order to get a scan- and frequency-invariant taper, its synthesis must comprise all far-field directions of the AF including those of invisible u-v space. This communication describes the Fourier properties responsible for the degradation of taper sidelobe level performance when the taper synthesis excludes the invisible space region of the AF. Examples are presented for a circular array antenna to illustrate the impact of the invisible region of the AF on sidelobe performance. The presented results refer to phase-only and amplitude-only sidelobe tapers. The requirements to realize for aperiodic planar array antennas' scan and frequency proof patterns with invariant PSLL are shortly addressed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2570233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7471447","Array factor (AF);low-sidelobe synthesis;periodic planar array antennas;scanning;visible space","Planar arrays;Finite element analysis;Phased arrays;Frequency synthesizers;Degradation","","20","","16","IEEE","18 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reflection characteristics of this structure are computed with a full-wave computational technique that utilizes the dyadic Green's function evaluated by an equivalent transmission line modeling in the spectral domain. The obtained dyadic Green's function is then used in an integral equation for the induced surface current densities on the metallic gratings. The resulting integral equation is solved by the Galerkin's method of moments with subdomain basis functions. With the help of this semianalytical method, the phase diagram of the reflectarray unit cell is computed. Using the calculated phase diagram, a center-fed reflectarray is designed at a center frequency of 10.5 GHz. To validate the numerical results, the designed reflectarray for the X-band (8.95-12.1 GHz) is fabricated and measured. The measurements on a 270 mm × 270 mm and F/D = 0.95 reflectarray show a maximum gain of 26.57 dBi with a 1-dB gain bandwidth of 29.5% and an efficiency of 41% at 10.5 GHz.

Two effective magnetic loops with constant magnetic currents are formed to produce omnidirectional radiation pattern in the azimuth plane. The gains in the plane are enhanced by interference effect of the fields formed by the two loops. The TM01 mode and TM02 mode are excited simultaneously by adjusting the parameters of feeding structures to form a wide band. Prototype antennas working at 5 GHz are designed, optimized, fabricated, and measured, and bandwidths of 5% are achieved. The radiation patterns are stable in the operation band, and gains larger than 2 dBi in the azimuth plane at most frequencies can be observed. The elevation angles are about 30° at various frequencies, lower than that for typical omnidirectional patch antennas.

The antenna includes a half-wavelength dipole and a one-wavelength loop that are printed on different sides of a substrate. To control the radiation characteristics of each element separately, the dipole is fed using a coaxial cable, whereas the loop is fed using offset broad-side coupling. To overcome the low front-to-back ratio (FBR) at lower and upper frequencies of the band, where the loop-dipole mode is not dominant, while maintaining a compact size, a parasitic strip is located in the vicinity of the loop. The strip acts as a director for the dipole at the low frequencies and for the loop at the high frequencies and thus significantly improves the FBR at those frequencies. The antenna achieves a wide fractional operating bandwidth of 49% at 0.7-1.15 GHz, a size reduction of more than 50% compared with recent similar designs, stable gain with a peak value of 4.8 dBi, and a minimum FBR of 11 dB across the operating bandwidth. Owing to its compact and planar structure, lightweight, simple fabrication, and stable radiation characteristic, it can be utilized in various wireless applications operating at the ultrahigh-frequency band.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2570246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7471442","Dipole antenna;loop–dipole composite antenna;unidirectional antenna;wideband antenna","Dipole antennas;Bandwidth;Couplings;Broadband antennas;Impedance;Magnetoelectric effects;Antenna radiation patterns","","26","","19","IEEE","18 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed device is composed of 2-D periodic arrays of subwavelength inductive wire grids and capacitive patches separated by dielectric substrates. The structure is built on an inductively coupled MEFSS that uses capacitively loaded dielectric spacers as its main resonators. The two operating bands of this MEFSS correspond to the first and second resonant frequencies of its constituting resonators. By judiciously choosing the locations where the resonators are loaded and the load values, the frequencies of the first and second resonances can be controlled individually. In this way, a dual-band MEFSS with independent frequency bands of operation can be obtained. Using the equivalent circuit model of this MEFSS, a synthesis procedure is developed that can be used to synthesize the dual-band MEFSS from its system-level performance indicators. A prototype of the proposed dual-band MEFSS with second-order bandpass response at each band is designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. The measurement results of this device show a stable frequency response with respect to the angle of incidence up to ±45° for both the TE and TM polarizations of incidence.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2580181","China Scholarship Council; U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1101146); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-16-1-2308); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490333","Frequency selective surfaces (FSSs);multiband filters;periodic structures;spatial filters","Resonant frequency;Frequency selective surfaces;Dual band;Capacitors;Integrated circuit modeling;Dielectric substrates;Equivalent circuits","","61","","17","IEEE","13 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
