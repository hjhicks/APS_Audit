An inherent geometrical symmetry of a four-arm spiral antenna and feeding rearrangement are exploited to achieve the simultaneous transmit (TX) and receive (RX) functionalities without any time, polarization, or frequency multiplexing. The antenna is configured such that one arm-pair is used for TX and the other for RX. Thus, even though the two antennas are spatially separated by 90°, they still share the same aperture and the system is considered monostatic. Theoretical and computational studies are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach under ideal conditions as well as in the presence of feed network non-idealities. The experimental data indicate that isolation levels greater than 39.6-50 dB over multiple octaves are achievable with realistic components. To improve the TX and RX far-field patterns, the planar four-arm spiral aperture is grounded via resistor-loaded quadrifilar helix with the two-arm TX/two-arm RX feed arrangement preserved. Furthermore, to simplify the feed network and reduce the impact of hybrid imbalances, an impedance-transforming microstrip feed is integrated with each arm pair. Isolation > 37 dB and similar with high-quality measured and simulated TX/RX radiation patterns are obtained over the operating bandwidth.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2497356","Office of Naval Research (ONR)(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2125); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7317532","Self-interference cancellation;mutual coupling;spiral;ultra wideband antennas;Mutual coupling;self-interference cancelation;spiral;ultra-wideband antennas","Spirals;Antenna radiation patterns;Bandwidth;Feeds;Ports (Computers);Receiving antennas","","96","","33","IEEE","3 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new fundamental mode is excited inside the polymer, based on the special boundary conditions enforced by the metallic plates and strip.

An antenna structure is fabricated using acrylic (εr = 3) and the measured results are compared with the results of other compact antennas, which can be realized using very high-permittivity materials.

A common mode/differential mode (CM/DM) decomposition of antenna current on PPMA is carried out to show that the CM current distribution is similar to the current distribution of an asymmetrically fed dipole. The designed three-element Yagi-Uda antenna operates in the 2.4-GHz band with F/B ratio of about 23 dB and gain of 7.3 dBi. The compact pattern diversity antennas are realized by using two Yagi-Uda antennas separated by a common reflector. Two diversity antennas are realized using two different arrangements of Yagi-Uda antennas. The separation between the constituent PPMAs is varied to study its effect on the isolation and element embedded efficiency. The better of the two diversity antennas has overall footprint area of 65 × 58 mm2 and the separation between two radiating elements is only 34 mm or 0.272 λo.

This makes the antenna both low cost and easy to integrate with common differential circuits. The antenna consists of an opening cavity formed by metalized vias, which encloses a set of loop-like strips that are fed differentially. The strips carry traveling wave current which together with the aperture's E-fields distribution give rise to CP radiation. The aperture size of the antenna can be extended for higher gain by adopting a dual- or quadruple-loop-like strips configuration enclosed by a larger opening cavity. The fabricated quadruple-loop-like strips-based antenna prototype designed to operate at 60-GHz band could achieve 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 16.7% (56-66.2 GHz) within its -10-dB impedance bandwidth and stable right-handed CP (RHCP) gain throughout the operating bandwidth with a peak of 14.6 dBi.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2499750","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2014CB339900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61372056); Science Technology and Innovation Committee of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JSGG20150331154209122); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328275","Aperture antenna;broadband;circular polarization (CP);differential feeding;high gain;planar antenna;millimeter-wave (mmWave);Aperture antenna;broadband;circular polarization (CP);differential feeding;high gain;millimeter-wave (mm-Wave);planar antenna","Aperture antennas;Cavity resonators;Broadband antennas;Bandwidth;Antenna arrays","","118","","33","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna is formed by using two inverted-F antenna (IFA) structures to provide a low band and a high band to, respectively, cover the LTE/WWAN operation in the 824-960 and 1710-2690 MHz bands. The larger IFA has a longer radiating metal strip for the low band, and the smaller IFA has a shorter radiating metal strip for the high band. The two radiating metal strips are configured to be a portion of the metal frame disposed around the edges of the metal back cover of the tablet computer. The projection of the metal frame lies on the edges of the metal back cover, such that there is no ground clearance between the projection and the metal back cover. Furthermore, the feeding and shorting strips with matching networks therein for the two IFAs are disposed on a small dielectric substrate (feed circuit board), which is separated from the system circuit board and the metal back cover. In this case, there is generally no planar space of the metal back cover and system circuit board occupied, and the antenna can cover the 824-960/1710-2690 MHz bands. Results of the proposed antenna are presented. An extended study is also presented to show that the antenna's low-band coverage can be widened from 824-960 to 698-960 MHz.

The designs achieve improved broadside-realized gains, particularly at the high-frequency side of the UWB band. An arc-shaped slot is etched into the radiating patch of a standard compact elliptically shaped UWB monopole antenna. The resulting parasitic element is engineered to produce its fundamental resonant mode in such a manner that a more compact overall design is realized and the broadside-realized gain in the upper UWB frequency range is improved while maintaining impedance matching without any significant changes to the original design parameters. In agreement with simulations, a 61.7% reduction in size from previous designs is demonstrated with more than a 6 dB increase in the realized gain near 10 GHz. To further improve its high-frequency characteristics, a multimode-resonator filter consisting of a single-wing element is combined with the slot-modified UWB antenna. The filter is first designed, fabricated, and measured to demonstrate that it produces the predicted appropriate transmission characteristics throughout the UWB band. The design integration of this compact filter is then presented and the resulting performance characteristics of the overall antenna system illustrate its advantages. The simulated and measured results are in good agreement. They indicate that the integrated design possesses sharp frequency cutoffs at both edges of the UWB passband, as well as strong upper stop-band attenuation.

Furthermore, the proposed $2 \times 2$ -element slot array is used as subarray to implement a differentially fed $4 \times 4$ -element array. The measured results demonstrate that this simple structure antenna array features wideband, high radiation efficiency, good aperture efficiency, and broadside radiation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2504359","Technology Research Project of Shenzhen City(grant numbers:JSGG20150331154209122); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2014B050504002); National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2014CB339900); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7339709","Antenna;feeding network;higher order mode;slot array;Antenna;feeding network;higher order mode;slot array","Arrays;Antenna arrays;Cavity resonators;Bandwidth;Microstrip;Slot antennas;Antenna feeds","","51","","25","IEEE","30 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They can be characterized by homogenized-boundary conditions, which, in absence of losses, can be represented through an equivalent reactance. In this paper, we introduce a general representation of isotropic frequency-dependent reactance which is valid along the dispersion curve of the relevant TM SW. This representation is written in terms of a transition function derived from a manipulation of the Cardano's formula for third-degree algebraic equations. Throughout a large portion of the dispersion curve, this transition function depends on one parameter only, which is an equivalent quasi-static capacitance. Approaching the Floquet-Bloch region, where many higher order Floquet modes are excited, two additional parameters should be extracted from the full-wave data to complete the transitional representation of the reactance until the upper boundary of the Brillouin region. The final formula is valid for a generic isotropic reactance and for an anisotropic reactance when the direction of propagation is along a symmetry axis of the unit cell element.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2500264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328270","Metasurfaces;surface impedance;surface waves;Metasurfaces;surface impedance;surface-waves","Capacitance;Dispersion;Geometry;Antennas;Surface waves;Surface impedance;Impedance","","29","","20","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to approaches based solely on electric currents, the proposed technique ensures no stored energy interior to the antenna exterior surface, and thus, allows the fundamental lower bound on Q to be determined. To facilitate the computation of the bound, new expressions for the stored energy, radiated power, and Q of coupled electric and magnetic source currents in free space are derived.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2499764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7327168","Electrically small antennas;frequency bandwidth;magnetic currents;physical bounds;Poynting’s theorem;quality factor;Q factor;radiation;reactive energy;stored energy;Electrically small antennas;frequency bandwidth;magnetic currents;physical bounds;Poynting’s theorem;quality factor (Q);radiation;reactive energy;stored energy","Current density;Dipole antennas;Q-factor;Bandwidth;Boundary conditions;Integral equations","","17","","35","IEEE","11 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There, the attention was focused on plane waves, whereas here we treat surface waves (SWs) excited on impenetrable impedance surfaces. Space variability of the boundary conditions imposes a deformation of the SW wavefront, which addresses the local wavector along not-rectilinear paths. The ray paths are subjected to an eikonal equation analogous to the one for geometrical optics (GO) rays in graded index materials. The basic relations among ray paths, ray velocity, and transport of energy for both isotropic and anisotropic boundary conditions are presented for the first time. This leads to an elegant formulation which allows for closed form analysis of flat operational devices (lenses or beam formers), giving a new guise to old concepts. It is shown that when an appropriate transformation is found, the ray paths can be conveniently controlled without the use of ray tracing, thus simplifying the problem and leading to a flat version of transformation optics, which is framed here in the general FO theory.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2500259","Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship; 7th European Community Framework Programme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328279","Metasurfaces;Surface-waves;Geometrical Optics;Transformation Optics;Ray Tracing;Geometrical optics;metasurfaces;ray tracing;surface waves;transformation optics","Optics;Surface impedance;Optical surface waves;Impedance;Surface waves;Boundary conditions;Surface treatment","","41","","39","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the calibration process, we need to determine the amplitude and phase of the sources so that the simulated data can match the measured data. These data are difficult to measure due to the casing effect from metallic well pipes. Previous work usually defines the source amplitude and phase as unknowns. They are either computed before or inverted simultaneously during the inversion process. Using the variable projection method, we transform these unknowns into a least-square representation of measured and simulate data. This way we avoid these unknowns in the inversion process. Therefore, this method shows a better computational efficiency. Moreover, it improves the robustness of the inversion especially for gradient methods such as the nonlinear conjugate gradient method. We have incorporated this scheme into the two-and-half-dimensional EM data inversion algorithm and it works effectively in reconstructing the conductivity distribution.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2498946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7322223","inverse problems;nonlinear inversion;data calibration;variable projection method;Data calibration;inverse problems;nonlinear inversion;variable projection method","Conductivity;Calibration;Electromagnetics;Jacobian matrices;Robustness;Gradient methods;Mathematical model","","3","","22","IEEE","9 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the use of shorting loaded technique, the overall size of the antenna is only λo/8 · 8 × λo/8 · 8 × λo/19 , and high-permittivity substrate is replaced by low-cost F4b substrate. The DCSP technique that this communication proposed enables this antenna to resonate at L1/L2 GPS bands. Simulated and measured voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) is below 1.5 over both the bands, and boresight RHCP gain is 4.49 and 4.12 dBic over a large ground plane with 41 and 57 MHz 3-dB gain bandwidth at the L2 and L1 band, respectively.

Channel-sounding measurements have been carried out at 3.6 GHz in a crowded university hall during several short and long breaks in-between courses. During three consecutive days, the measurements were repeated with different positions for the transmit and receive antennas. In this study, the behavior of the maximum Doppler shift and the Doppler spread was analyzed in the time-delay domain as a function of the occupation of the hall, the polarizations of the 2 × 2 MIMO antennas, and their positions in the hall. The measurements reveal a clear distinction between the Doppler spread of the short and long breaks in the campaign, indicating a distinctive power distribution of their Doppler spectra. In addition, there is a significant contrast between the Doppler characteristics of the co- and cross-polarizations. Measurements at several positions reveal the importance of characterizing multipaths and show that the Doppler effect depends on the position of the antennas in the environment. In addition, this work also shows that the Doppler spectrum can be accurately modeled by a Cauchy distribution, allowing for the generation of parameters to describe Doppler characteristics.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2503480","IUAP BESTCOM; FWO Project(grant numbers:3G027714); Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT); Research Foundation Flanders (FWO); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336515","Channel Sounding & Modeling;Delay-Doppler;Multipath Propagation;Polarization;Indoor Environment;Channel sounding and modeling;delay-Doppler;indoor environment;multipath propagation;polarization","Antenna measurements;Doppler shift;OFDM;Position measurement;Receivers;Channel estimation","","4","","7","IEEE","24 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For compressing an off-diagonal submatrix of the method of moments (MoM) impedance matrix with a binary tree, the $L$-level MLACA includes $L+1$ steps, and each step includes $2^L$ ACA-SVD decompositions. If the relative Frobenius norm error of the ACA-SVD used in the MLACA is smaller than $\varepsilon $, the rigorous proof in this communication shows that the relative Frobenius norm error of the $L$-level MLACA is smaller than ${(1 + \varepsilon)^{L + 1}} - 1$. In practical applications, the error bound of the MLACA can be approximated as $\varepsilon (L + 1)$, because $\varepsilon $ is always $\ll 1$. The error upper bound can be used to control the accuracy of the MLACA. To ensure an error of the $L$-level MLACA smaller than $\varepsilon $ for different $L$, the ACA-SVD threshold can be set to ${(1 + \varepsilon)^{\tfrac{1}{{L + 1}}}} - 1$, which approximately equals ${\varepsilon/{(L + 1)}}$ for practical applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2502624","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61501227,61071019); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2015M581789); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:NJ20140009); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332949","error bound;method of moments (MoM);low- rank decomposition;multilevel adaptive cross approximation (MLACA);Error bound;low-rank decomposition;method of moments (MoM);multilevel adaptive cross approximation (MLACA)","Method of moments;Approximation methods;Impedance;Signal processing algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Binary trees;Upper bound","","4","","12","IEEE","20 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The size of the element is a fifth of a wavelength at the center frequency of 10 GHz and the element consists of double concentric square rings of meander lines. By changing the length of the meander line, a 420° phase variation range is achieved at the center frequency. This characteristic makes the proposed configuration unique, as most of the reported subwavelength reflectarray elements can only realize a phase range far less than 360°. In addition, the slope of the phase response remains almost constant from 9 to 11 GHz, demonstrating a broadband property. A $48 \times 48$-element reflectarray antenna is simulated, fabricated, and measured. Good agreement is obtained between simulated and measured results. A measured 1.5-dB gain bandwidth of 18% and 56.5% aperture efficiency is achieved.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2502978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7335591","Reflectarray antenna;sub-wavelength;meander line;double square ring;microstrip;Double square ring;meander line;microstrip;reflectarray antenna;subwavelength","Broadband antennas;Reflection;Reflector antennas;Antenna measurements;Bandwidth;Chemical elements;Broadband communication","","118","","20","IEEE","23 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The working mechanism is analyzed based on the S-parameters and the surface current distributions. The 0.25-wavelength, 0.5-wavelength, and 1-wavelength modes of the monopole antenna are excited and used.
