The micron-size-thick film is made from high-permittivity dielectric paste, which is printed on a low-loss low-permittivity microwave substrate to operate as a magnetic wall boundary. A simplified theoretical model is developed to analyze the antenna structure. The accuracy of this model is evaluated by the results of a commercial three-dimensional (3-D) electromagnetic field solver. The model works well with less than 5% deviation from time-consuming simulations, providing the permittivity contrast between the film and substrate is kept high (e.g., > 30). The impact of dielectric loss of the film in antenna performance is significantly less than that of the substrate, allowing medium-loss films (e.g., $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon^{\prime{\prime}}} = 3$) results in highly efficient antennas with over 95% radiation efficiency. A prototype was made using screen printing and experimentally characterized at Ku-band. The experimental results confirm the theoretical achievements. The measured $-10\;\text{dB}$ impedance bandwidth of the printable planar dielectric antenna having dimensions of 0.2 $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{0} \times 0.2 \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{0}$ is over 10% with a measured gain ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 dBi. Broadside radiation patterns with cross polarization levels of lower than ${-} 20\;{\text{dB}}$ are achieved. This process is compatible with low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) technology where similar idea can be applied to other passive microwave components.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2502265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332737","BST;compact antennas;ferroelectric material;low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC);thick films;screen printing;wideband antennas;Barium–strontium–titanate (BST);compact antennas;ferroelectric material;low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC);screen printing;thick films;wideband antennas","Films;Permittivity;Microwave antennas;Dielectrics;Substrates;Microwave theory and techniques","","45","","18","IEEE","20 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The input impedance mismatch is addressed by modifying the structure of the antenna feed. Adding a spatial quarter-wave transformer matches the wave impedance of the loading region to that of free space. The feasibility of such a loading scheme is validated by effectively miniaturizing a monocone antenna with a material of $\upvarepsilon_{\rm r}=9.0$. Simulations show the diameter of the ground plane is reduced by 55.2%, while the miniaturized monocone has a relative impedance bandwidth of 106.3%. The proposed dielectric loading concept is further applied to miniaturize three other monocone antennas to show its generality.

Meanwhile, a multifrequency phase matching method is proposed to realize a beam-scanning lens in both MMW and THz regions. The design concept of the beam-scanning lens is applicable to other frequency ranges as well, which opens new opportunities for future lens design. Moreover, three-dimensional (3-D) printing technology is employed to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce the cost.

On this basis, a reliability-aware definition of optimization parameters can be derived to minimize failure probability during fabrication. For demonstration, a particular type of antenna, namely the tapered half-mode substrate-integrated waveguide (HMSIW) leaky-wave antenna, is chosen for the reliability analysis and optimization.

In common with the conventional approach, the power of the interferometric field of the antenna under test (AUT) and a reference antenna, whose field is known in advance, as well as the power of the AUT alone, is measured at the desired frequencies. Nevertheless, the phase retrieval is accomplished independently at each spatial point by filtering in the time-domain (TD) rather than in the k-space. Thus, the dependency of the phase retrieval on the position accuracy is reduced and it can be accomplished simultaneously at all frequencies without resorting to iterative schemes. Moreover, it yields a less dense sampling and a phase-retrieval algorithm not dependent on the geometry of the acquisition.

However, a degradation of the communication performance must be usually accepted for achieving the sensing capability. This work introduces a design method suitable for phase-based RFID sensors that permits to shape the phase response while preserving the impedance matching between the antenna and the microchip. The RFID sensor is modeled as a two-ports scatterer comprising a lumped sensor at one of the ports and an RFID chip at the other port. A pole-zero representation of the electromagnetic interaction between the reader and the RFID sensor allows to introduce a constrained design of the antenna with a full control on the sensor dynamic range and on the communication performance.

Based on the Bessel function approximation of the circular array pattern and the compressed sensing (CS) theory, the synthesis of a sparse concentric current ring array can be formulated as a convex problem with the minimization of $l_1$-norm, and the corresponding array parameters including the number of concentric rings, the ring radii, and the current ring excitations can be determined simultaneously to satisfy the requirements on radiation pattern. In order to reconstruct the 3-D pattern accurately with discrete antenna elements in place of the current rings, a determined approach with or without radial amplitude weighting is proposed to define the number of elements equally distributed on each ring. The proposed hybrid method can be applied to synthesizing CRAs with 3-D pattern either matching a desired pattern or satisfying a prescribed power mask.

A crossed slot with four parasitic patches is proposed as the CP element, which is fed by a unique 90° delay line. There are three minimal AR points within the operational frequency band to widen the bandwidth. The 90° delay line has three branches to realize the phase delay, the amplitude compensation, and the impedance matching, respectively. Thus, the design process is clear and simple. Several short-circuited posts are added in the feeding layer to suppress the TEM wave propagating outside the feeding network. Simulated results of the element show an AR bandwidth ($\text{AR} < 3\;\text{dB}$) of 21.2% from 25.3 to 31.3 GHz and a gain of 5.7–6.7 dBic over the same frequency band.

Here, we propose a planar solution realized with a single multi-layer PCB, with consequent reduction in cost and complexity of the array. It consists of an array of connected slots backed by a metallic reflector and loaded with superstrates. Artificial dielectric layers (ADLs) are used in place of real dielectrics to realize the superstrates, as they are characterized by very low surface-wave losses. For the unit-cell design, we developed an analysis tool based on closed-form expressions and thus requiring minimal computational resources. Finite-array simulations are also performed by generalizing the analysis method to account for the truncation effects. The presence of the ADL superstrate allows reducing the distance between the array plane and the backing reflector while maintaining good matching performance. A realistic feed structure is also proposed, which consists of a microstrip line connected to a coaxial feed. Such a solution does not require balanced-to-unbalanced transitions, which often limit the achievable bandwidth. The proposed structure achieves in simulations more than an octave bandwidth (6.5–14.5 GHz), within a scanning range of $\pm 50$° in all azimuth planes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2507167","European Research Council starting(grant numbers:ERC-2011-StG AAATSI,278794); Dutch Technology Foundation (STW)(grant numbers:10709); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) VENI(grant numbers:13673); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350127","Artificial dielectric;connected arrays;wideband arrays;wide-scan array;Artificial dielectric;connected arrays;wideband arrays;wide-scan array","Antenna arrays;Broadband antennas;Wideband;Dielectrics;Feeds;Slabs","","100","","28","IEEE","9 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All the embedded element patterns are evaluated for each source through a fast Green's function spectral approach, taking into account the effects of the mutual coupling during the optimization procedure.

Comparisons with the line-by-line method of the same Recommendation, using radiosonde data as input, show good to very good agreement at 20, 30, and 350 GHz for an Arctic location, a tropical area in Australia, and two midlatitude locations—one in the Rocky Mountains and the other closer to sea level. Some limitations of the approximate method over very high mountains, where surface pressure is lower than the 780-hPa reference of the water vapor attenuation model of Annex 2, are also discussed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2510661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362000","Gaseous attenuation;radiowave propagation;low-angle propagation;exponential atmospheric model;asymptotic expansion of integrals;Asymptotic expansion of integrals;exponential atmospheric model;gaseous attenuation;low-angle propagation;radiowave propagation","Atmospheric modeling;Terrestrial atmosphere;Sea level;Earth;Sea surface;Antennas;Absorption","","5","","24","Crown","22 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The signatures of radar images are mainly determined by the aspect dependencies of the scattering amplitude and location of scattering centers. According to the aspect dependency characteristics, scattering centers are classified into three types. Each type provides different geometry information on the targets. This study presents the characteristics of these three types of scattering centers by using the parametric models and signatures of different radar images. The time-frequency representations (TFRs) of radar returns are found to have some advantages in geometry reconstruction compared with other radar images. Based on the parametric models of the scattering centers, a framework for recovering geometry by using TFR is proposed.

For infinite extension surfaces, we obtain the probability density functions (pdfs) for the modulus and phase of the total field components. The modulus pdf is expressed as an infinite sum of modified Bessel functions while the phase pdf is expressed in terms of the error function. Under oblique illumination, the total field is not wide-sense stationary. From a spatial point of view, for a given elevation and under all incidences, we show that the total field is ergodic to the second order. Under oblique incidence, the spatial distribution of the total field modulus is a Rayleigh law and the phase is uniform.

Furthermore, the use of ultrawideband (UWB) signals is attractive for these communications due to their robustness and their suitability for precision ranging and localization. For the development and performance simulation of such systems, accurate channel models are required. The current paper thus presents details of an extensive measurement campaign for near-ground UWB propagation channels and a channel model-based thereon. The measurements were performed with a self-built channel sounder based on arbitrary waveform generation at the transmitter, high-bandwidth sampling oscilloscope at the receiver, and synchronization via electro-optical connections. Various combinations for the antenna height at transmitter and receiver, ranging from 10  cm to 2 m above ground, were measured. We find that the pathloss coefficient ($\gamma$) depends significantly on the Tx–Rx antenna heights, while shadowing variance ($\sigma^2$) and rms delay-spread (${\tau}_{rms}$) shows smaller dependence. The pathloss shows a slight dependence on frequency; the frequency-dependent pathloss exponent ($\kappa$) increases as antennas get closer to the ground. We also found a linear dependency of the rms delay-spread on distance for various antenna height configurations measured. Statistical distributions of all parameters including $\gamma$, ${\tau}_{rms}$, $\sigma^2$, and $\kappa$ are extracted from the measurements. Results are verified by comparing with a second measurement campaign.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2505004","7th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EUCAP); Office of Naval Research (ONR)(grant numbers:N00014-11-1-0011,N00014-11-1-0397); DURIP (Defense University Research Instrumentation Program); MRI; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345538","Propagation channel;statistical channel model;Near-ground;MIMO;near-ground;propagation channel;statistical channel model;ultrawidebandwidth (UWB)","Antenna measurements;Frequency measurement;Receiving antennas;Bandwidth;Transmitting antennas","","32","","55","IEEE","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, coupling patches are embedded between the adjacent driven elements, and coupling energy is transferred between driven elements by the coupling patches.

The antenna is radome enclosed and consists of a wideband biconical antenna that provides omnidirectional radiation patterns with vertical polarization and a multiscreen polarizer that converts vertical polarization into 45° slant-polarization. To achieve high-performance radiation characteristics, the geometrical dimensions of the multiscreen polarizer are optimized. Invasive weed optimization algorithm is used as an optimizer tool. In the optimization procedure, the antenna impedance bandwidth, pattern ripple in the azimuth plane, and copolarized gain/cross-polarized gain ratio are optimization goals. A prototype of the 45° SPOA is fabricated and measured. The measured voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of the antenna is less than 2.15. Moreover, experimental results show that pattern ripple in the azimuth plane is lower than $\pm {1}\,{\text{dB}}$, and copolarized gain/cross-polarized gain ratio is higher than 26 dB, over 2–40-GHz frequency band. The efficiency of the fabricated antenna both in bandwidth and optimality of the results is compared with a number of commercially available wideband 45° SPOAs.

The second approach is obtained by further relaxing the sparse optimal impedance matching method to obtain a suboptimal impedance matching (SOM) method we refer to as multiport ladder matching (MLM). Simulation results show that the sparse optimal impedance matching approach provides the maximum received power while MLM can capture more power than conventional single-port matching (SPM). Additionally, they can maintain good bandwidth indicating the effectiveness of the sparse optimal and multiport ladder impedance matching approaches.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2510006","Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:16207314); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360138","Impedance Matching;Mutual coupling;Random field;Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO);Energy Harvesting;Energy harvesting;impedance matching;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);mutual coupling;random field","Ports (Computers);Admittance;Impedance matching;Symmetric matrices;Radio frequency;Antennas","","24","","17","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An air gap is used between the substrate and ground plane to control the operating frequency of the surface without changing the substrate thickness. Required susceptance of the surface to produce CP is calculated using the equivalent transmission line model. The surface consists of small-size patches inside slotted large patches to construct a circular polarizer with two frequency bands: 1.9–2.3 GHz and 7.9–8.3 GHz. Sizes of the patches are obtained using analytical formulas. In addition, it is indicated that the permitted beamwidth of the incident wave can be increased by reducing the propagation angle ${{\theta}}$. The circular polarizer with reduced ${{\theta }}$ has 52% and 9.8% bandwidths for less than 3 dB axial ratio with ${{{\theta }}_{{\bf max}}} = 39^\circ $ and ${{{\theta }}_{{\min}}} = 25^\circ $. Finally, comparison between LHCP and RHCP radiation patterns of an antenna with the proposed circular polarizer indicates more than 10 dB difference throughout the main lobe.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2511152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362121","Circular Polarization;Dual Frequency;Electromagnetic bandgap structures;Frequency Selective Surfaces;Circular polarization (CP);dual frequency;electromagnetic bandgap structures;frequency selective surfaces (FSSs)","Arrays;Bandwidth;Surface impedance;Antenna measurements;Polarization;Dual band;Frequency selective surfaces","","49","","20","IEEE","22 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their distinct feature is a single-slab superstrate that has a permittivity gradient in the directions transverse to the antenna axis. The application of such a superstrate in a single-feed RCA improves the DBP by a factor of three or more as compared with superstrates composed of uniform dielectric slabs. Their very small area enables an antenna designer to achieve unprecedented figures of DBP per unit area, from a simple planar antenna. Prototype RCAs have been fabricated and measurements have validated the concept. A measured 3-dB directivity bandwidth of 52.9% was demonstrated with a measured directivity of 16.4 dBi for an RCA that has a very small total footprint area of 1.54$\lambda_0^2$ at the lowest operating frequency (2.84$\lambda_{0,c}^2$ at the center frequency).
