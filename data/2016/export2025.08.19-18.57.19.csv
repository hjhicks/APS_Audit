This antenna is made possible by a tunable artificial magnetic conducting (AMC) substrate combined with tunable crossed end-loaded dipoles. Intertwined miniaturized periodic unit cells comprise the AMC, presenting a homogeneous interface to the dipoles above. Moreover, the AMC structure is predominantly air, making it very lightweight. Tunable capacitors on the dipoles allow the dynamic reconfiguration of their input impedances, which in turn allows for near-arbitrary dynamic adjusting of the antenna's polarization for the left- or right-hand circular as well as linear with various orientations.

"Why the Magnetic Loss Tangent Is Not a Relevant Constraint for Permeable Conformal Antennas","T. Yousefi; T. Sebastian; R. E.

Deriving in closed form the radiation efficiency of these antennas and using full-wave simulations, we show that their radiation efficiency is not necessarily reduced by the loss tangent of the permeable material. It is shown that the key material parameter controlling the radiation efficiency of these antennas is not the loss tangent but the maximum of the Heaviside magnetic conductivity, a quantity proportional to Snoek's product. This yields the clear design rules for obtaining permeable antennas with maximized efficiency-bandwidth product (EBWP). Because the radiating currents of these antennas are the magnetic polarization currents in the material, they can be placed close to a metal ground plane or inside a low impedance medium without performance degradation while having an EBWP much higher than the metal-and-dielectric antennas having the same conformal volume, in spite of the presence of the magnetic loss. As an example, an antenna operating from HF to VHF can attain an EBWP 10 dB higher than the corresponding metal antenna. Similarly, using the Best-Yaghjian formalism, it is shown that these antennas are easier to match and can attain wider bandwidths than the equivalent conformal metal antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2554198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7452595","Antenna efficiency;conformal antennas;impedance matching;permeable antennas;permeable materials","Mathematical model;Impedance;Dipole antennas;Integrated circuit modeling;Dielectrics;Metals","","16","","20","IEEE","14 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Synchronous electric edge fields which contribute to radiation occupy almost all the areas of both sides of the plate. Compared with a typical microstrip antenna with a rectangular cavity, the triangular-cavity-cascaded antenna is a relatively open structure with less shorting boundary around.

This EM phenomenon enables electrically small retrodirective antenna arrays with superdirective, angular superresolution, auto-pointing properties for an arbitrary DoA. A theoretical explanation of the phenomenon based on first principal observations is given and full-wave simulations demonstrate a realizability route for the proposed retrodirective terminal that is comprised of resonance dipole antenna elements. Specifically, it is shown that a three-element disk-loaded retrodirective dipole array with 0.15λ spacings can achieve a 3.4-dBi maximal gain, 3-dBi front-to-back ratio, and 13% return loss fractional bandwidth (at the 10-dB level).

A properly designed centered circular waveguide feed excites the two orthogonal (decoupled) SW modes and guarantees the balance of the power associated with each of them. By a proper selection of the anisotropy and modulation of the MTS pattern, the phase velocities of the two modes are synchronized, and leakage is generated in broadside direction with two orthogonal linear polarizations.

Also, it proposes an expression for the current on an infinitely long cylindrical dipole antenna of finite conductivity, which is also in good agreement to the current found from applying the Fourier transform technique.

To improve accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, electronic devices could be implanted inside human body to provide various real-time diagnostic information. However, effective technique for communicating the implant with outside world is still an open problem. Early efforts based on radio wave propagation are standardized as the medical implant communication services (MICSs) for 402-405-MHz frequency range, which was later adopted as medical device radiocommunication services for 401-406-MHz frequency range. Intrabody communication (IBC) is a relatively new technique that uses the human body as a channel with communication frequencies not exceeding several megahertz. In this paper, we propose a new analytical electromagnetic model that uses galvanically coupled IBC as an alternative to radio wave-based implant communication. The model is unified in the sense that it is based on multilayered ellipsoidal geometry that can be applied to any part of the body (i.e., head, torso, limbs, and so on). Our model effectively describes the influences of tissue layer thicknesses and electromagnetic properties, implant size and depth, and geometry of the body part. The model proves the security and low power consumption of IBC. The path loss characterization of IBC implants shows lower values compared with their MICS counterparts.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2559519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460944","Electromagnetic model;ellipsoidal geometry;galvanically coupled intrabody communication (IBC);IBC;medical implants;multilayered","Implants;Geometry;Transmitters;Electrodes;Integrated circuit modeling;Biological system modeling;Electric potential","","29","","44","IEEE","27 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such a process can be described as the change of conductivity of the dielectric, which in this case, is a nonlinear function of the electric field. In this paper, the nonlinear conductivity is incorporated into Maxwell's equations, and the resulting nonlinear equation is solved using the time-domain finite-element method together with Newton's method (NM).

Combining the locally corrected Nyström (LCN) method with NURBS requires formulating LCN on both quadrilateral and triangular Bézier surfaces, as a typical NURBS-generated Bézier mesh includes elements of both the types. While on quadrilateral elements the product of 1-D Gaussian quadrature rules can be applied to LCN effectively, Gaussian integration rules available for triangles cannot efficiently be applied to LCN for two reasons. First, they do not possess the same number of quadrature points as the number of functions in a complete set of polynomial basis at an arbitrary order. Second, they exacerbate the condition number of the resulting matrix equation at higher orders due to an increasing density of quadrature points near the edges and corners of triangles. In this paper, we construct a new set of quadrature rules for Bézier triangles (i.e., degenerate quadrilaterals) based on the Newton-Cotes (equidistant) quadrature rules and apply these rules to the LCN solution of the electric, magnetic, and combined field integral equations. Results show that the new family of quadrature rules overcomes both the aforementioned issues and can be applied to LCN effectively for orders from 0 to 9, inclusively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2560958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462996","Combined field integral equation (CFIE);electromagnetic scattering;high-order (HO) solution;locally corrected Nyström (LCN) method;nonuniform rational b-spline (NURBS) and Bezier surfaces;triangle Newton–Cotes quadrature","Splines (mathematics);Surface topography;Surface reconstruction;Method of moments;Solid modeling;Antennas","","8","","47","IEEE","29 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the straightforward CS formulation may be applied only when the incident beam is diverging as it hits the edge, but not when it is converging as it hits the wedge. In this paper, we generalize the CS setup, so that it can address both problems. The surprising result is that the CS approach can be applied for the converging beam case, but only if the CS coordinates are defined in a specific fashion. We then formulate the angular harmonics and the spectral integral representations for both cases, and also derive uniform asymptotic expressions for beam diffraction by a wedge. The validity of the results is verified by calculating the diffracted field via each one of these formulations, and comparing them with yet another approach, wherein the field of the incident diverging or converging beam is synthesized using a plane-wave integral, and the diffracted field is then calculated via multipole expansion.

Next, to solve the propagation problem, i.e., to calculate the scattered field in the duct, an appropriate Green function of the duct (which is a stratified medium with linear-square refraction index profile) is used to radiate the currents from Huygens' principle. Due to refraction phenomenon, this field induces new currents on the surface (second rebound), which are again evaluated by PO. The process is iterated. Then, for each rebound, the coherent components of the surface currents and the scattered field are calculated and compared with those of a flat surface in order to derive the generalized Ament model.

The number of individual wavelets is intentionally kept small in keeping with a realistic antenna array size, where each antenna would emit wavelets at conceivably very high power levels. Wavelet decomposition theory is coupled with particle swarm optimization to determine the necessary time shifts and amplitude adjustments of the wavelet signals. In this application, the reconstructed signal can be specified by a desired frequency or arbitrary shape. A pyramidal horn antenna array is used in the analysis of the far-field propagation of the wavelet signals due to its relatively large bandwidth and known analytical electric field solutions. It is found that when the wavelet signals are appropriately superpositioned and added in the far field, the desired signal may be reconstructed with the quality of reconstruction mostly governed by the intentionally low number of wavelets. The reconstructed signal is solely found on the centerline while the signal drastically changes off the centerline or at distances too close or too far from the antenna array.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2560921","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-13-1-0852 CFDA 12.300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462994","Antenna arrays;electromagnetic propagation;horn antennas;optimization","Antenna arrays;Discrete wavelet transforms;Particle swarm optimization;Shape;Horn antennas","","5","","19","IEEE","29 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, an improved impedance matching technique is introduced, which is aimed to improve the performance of the rectifier with a varying condition. A broadband dual CP receiving antenna is proposed, which has a very wide bandwidth (from 550 to 2.5 GHz) and a compact size. An annular ring structure and a novel feeding technique are employed in order to reduce the size and improve the antenna performance. As a result, the proposed rectenna is the first design that covers six frequency bands, including part of the digital TV and most cellular mobile and WLAN bands in the U.K., while the optimal load range for a constant conversion efficiency is from 10 to 75 kΩ.

Such oscillations have been associated with the nonsolvability of the underlying integral equations. They necessarily occur when the number of basis functions is sufficiently large and cannot be blamed on finite computer word length or matrix ill-conditioning effects. In this communication, we show that similar phenomena occur when one uses the extended thin-wire kernel, originally proposed by Poggio and Adams in the 1970s and currently used by the Numerical Electromagnetics Code, which is an antenna modeling software suite that has many variants (e.g., GNEC, EZNEC Pro, SuperNeC, MiniNEC). We discuss the nature and properties of the oscillations. In particular, we show that they are milder and less rapid than those with the approximate kernel. Our main tools of study are: 1) numerical investigations that carefully distinguish from effects due to roundoff and 2) an analytical study for the case of the antenna of infinite length.

In particular, we investi-gate the performance of switch-and-stay combining (SSC), switch-and-examine combining (SEC), and (SECps) schemes, which utilize multiple spatially separated antennas at the base station. During the measurements, a test subject, wearing an antenna on his chest, performed a number of walking movements toward and then away from a uniform linear array. It was found that all the considered diversity schemes provided a worthwhile signal improvement. However, the performance of the diversity systems varied according to the switching threshold that was adopted. To model the fading envelope observed at the output of each of the combiners, we have applied diversity specilic equations developed under the assumption of Nakagami-m fading. As a measure of the goodness-of-lit, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the empirical and theoretical probability density functions (pdfs) was calculated and found to be close to 0. To assist with the interpretation of the goodness-of-lit achieved in this communication, the standard deviation σ of a zero-mean, σ2 variance Gaussian pdf used to approximate a zero-mean, unit variance Gaussian pdf is also presented.

First, the Gaussian copula is tested for the modeling of joint exceedance probability of rain attenuation on a temporal domain with good results. Afterward, taking an advantage of the results from the previous tests, two expressions are proposed for the modeling of the Gaussian copula parameter as a function of time for the temperate and tropical regions. These expressions may be refined using more experimental beacon data in various climatic regions and for different satellite link characteristics. The synthesizer is based on the generation of time series from copula functions.

The space-domain MoM requires two basic functions to represent the electric and magnetic current densities on material interfaces, respectively, and the conventional choice of n̂ RWG basis function for representing the magnetic current density may not be good in the TDCFIEs. In addition, the MoT scheme has a well-known late-time instability problem, which will aggravate in the surface integral equations with penetrable media. In this communication, the TDCFIEs for composite structures are solved by a different approach in which the Nyström method is used to discretize the space domain, while the Galerkin method with Laguerre basis and testing functions is employed to discretize the time domain.

The transient response of the antenna is also analyzed. Despite the existence of multiple slot loading and folding in the proposed antenna, the investigation of the time domain responses reveals a directional low-distorted radiation (impulse fidelity factor of more than 80%) toward the boresight direction in both near and far fields.
