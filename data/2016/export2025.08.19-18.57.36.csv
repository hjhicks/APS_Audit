Using functional calculus, radiation integral is analyzed, and the first variational derivative (VD) of the radiation field with respect to surface profile is extracted. The VD can show the radiation pattern sensitivity to surface distortion. All formulations are based on the physical optics approximation. The final formula for VD depends only on the original undistorted antenna parameters, so it can be used for all types of distortions. It has been shown that the formulations are more general than those in previous works. Different polarization states of feed antenna are studied, and VD amplitudes are plotted to depict the regions that have greater effects on the main-lobe and the first few side-lobes levels. Some periodic, aperiodic, and local distortion profiles are considered, and the exact and approximated distorted patterns are compared to check the accuracy of the presented procedure.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2580157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490430","Distortion;functional analysis;physical optics (PO);reflector antennas","Distortion;Antenna radiation patterns;Feeds;Surface impedance;Optical distortion;Systematics","","19","","32","IEEE","13 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The performances are evaluated in terms of clean symmetric radiation patterns, high polarization purity, antenna efficiency, and radiation dispersivity. A logarithmic spiral antenna placed in the dielectric-air interface can provide high aperture efficiencies over large bandwidths if coupled to a synthesized elliptical lens. The use of an air gap increases the directivity of the spiral radiation inside the dielectric allowing for lens directive patterns without sidelobes and reducing the dispersivity of the radiated pulse. The directivity enhancement of the fields inside the dielectric is validated by the measurement of a prototype. The highest frequency at which these antennas can be fed by a planar microstrip line is limited by the thickness of the microstrip substrate.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2593744","European Research Council(grant numbers:ERC-2011-StG,AAATSI,no. 278794); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518607","Dispersion;leaky-wave antenna;lens antenna;spiral antenna;ultrawideband antenna","Spirals;Dielectrics;Lenses;Geometry;Antenna feeds","","15","","40","IEEE","21 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna is mainly composed of a feeding network, a driven patch, and a stacked patch, with its entire height being 0.09λ. The feeding network consists of two orthogonal H-shaped lines that coupled to the driven patch, each for one polarization. The elaborately designed feeding lines not only ensure a sharp roll-off rate at the lower band edge, but also help to achieve low cross polarization and high isolation between two feeding ports. On the other hand, the upper stacked patch provides improved suppression levels at the upper stopband and also an enhanced gain within passband. Consequently, a compact dual-polarized antenna with satisfying filtering performance is obtained, without using extra filtering circuits. For demonstration, an antenna is designed to fit the specification of LTE band (2.49-2.69 GHz). The implemented antenna achieves an average a gain of 9 dBi, a cross-polarization ratio of 29 dB, an isolation of 35 dB within LTE band. The out-of-band suppression level is more than 40 dB within the 2G and 3G frequency bands from 1.71-2.17 GHz.

Here, we introduce a concept of multifunctional engineered materials that possess different predetermined functionalities at different frequencies. Such response can be accomplished by cascading metasurfaces (thin composite layers) that are designed to perform a single operation at the desired frequency and are transparent elsewhere. Previously, out-of-band transparent metasurfaces for control over reflection and absorption were proposed. In this paper, to complete the full set of functionalities for wave control, we synthesize transmitarrays that tailor transmission in a desired way, being “invisible” beyond the operational band. The designed transmitarrays for wavefront shaping and anomalous refraction are tested numerically and experimentally. To demonstrate our concept of multifunctional engineered materials, we have designed and measured a cascade of three metasurfaces that performs three different functions for waves at different frequencies.

Employing two feed points per radiator enables switching among four polarization senses (two linear and two circular polarizations) using a polarization feed network (PFN). For realizing beam steering, the optimum amplitude and phase excitation coefficients for each radiating element were calculated using projection matrix method based on active element pattern, which is then applied to each corresponding radiating element using programmable digital phase shifters, low noise amplifiers, and attenuators arranged in a beam forming network. Measurement shows ±52° beam peak steering at 1.5 GHz and ±28° beam peak steering at 2.4 GHz based on 3 dB gain variation criteria for both the linear and circular polarizations.

Our approach is based on earlier theoretical work that showed, for an idealized infinite half-space geometry, that the solution could be constructed by an iterative time-reversal (TR) process. In this paper, we give a more realistic example involving a two-sensor time-domain system. We show that for this system, the iterative TR process can be used to tune automatically to all the target resonances that are within the bandwidth of the interrogating radar system. We show that although obtaining eigenvalues (and hence resonances) of the scattering operator is in general unstable, using the iterative TR process to obtain the resonances is a stable process.

The dispersion property of the NS method is similar with that of the standard higher order method, though it is only second order accurate in the space domain. The total number of nonzero update coefficients for this method is fewer than that of the latter.

By introducing a new dyad potential, this novel representation guarantees the integrand free from singularities along the computational path. As such, it can be easily integrated for arbitrary positions of the source and observation points. Conversely, for certain situations of the Hertzian dipole being on the cone connecting the observation point to the scattering rim, the existing formulations exhibit a nonremovable singularity in their integrands. This will lead to invalid or inaccurate results. Meanwhile, for near-singular integration region, time-consuming computations need to be performed by utilizing a variable mesh integration. The efficiency in numerical calculation is the main objective of this kind of approach, and the time reduction performance would be improved by our singularity-free formula. The line-integral representation offers an alternative method to rapidly solve the scattering problem as it is usually more efficient than producing the same result in conventional surface-integral.

The substrate integrated waveguide slot antenna array is implemented for demonstrations. Those vertical metallic walls, created by cofabricated open-air cavities, are placed at either side along the H-plane of slot radiators. Investigations were conducted on those key parameters of a single-slot antenna with two vertical metallic walls, in order to have a better understanding on the effect of the walls. Two prototypes, which are a 1 × 8 (1-D) and a 4 × 8 (2-D) waveguide slot antenna array, have been separately developed for verifications. The dimensions of the developed antenna arrays are determined based on a compromise between the performance and the fabrication restraint in the LTCC process. Both antenna arrays can efficiently transmit data within a 1000 MHz (59.5-60.5 GHz) bandwidth for some narrow band applications.

The operation principle of the proposed CP antenna is described at first through the combination of a planar magnetic dipole and a V-shape open loop. Then, it is demonstrated how its AR beamwidth can be precisely controlled with resorting to the shape and thickness of the open loop element. Finally, the theoretical design approach is numerically verified, and the results are then experimentally validated. It is observed that a 3 dB AR beamwidth is achieved in an extremely wide angular region up to 250° within the principal elevation plane over a frequency range of 2.41-2.51 GHz. The proposed antenna has exhibited a wide impedance bandwidth of 22.23% in fraction, a 3 dB AR bandwidth of no less than 8.00% in fraction, and a simple planar profile in geometry.

As an effective solution of the low-frequency problem, the perturbation method employs the Taylor expansion of the scalar Green's function in free space. However, multiple impedance matrices have to be solved at different frequency orders, and the computational cost becomes extremely high, especially for large-scale problems. Since the perturbed kernels still satisfy Toeplitz property on the uniform Cartesian grid, the FFT based on Lagrange interpolation can be well incorporated to accelerate the multiple matrix vector products. Because of the nonsingularity property of high-order kernels when n ≥ 1, we do not need to do any near field amendment. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is validated in an iterative solver with numerical examples.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2593930","Thousand Young Talents Program of China; Hong Kong RGC(grant numbers:GRF 716112,716713,17207114); Hong Kong UGC(grant numbers:AoE/P-04/08); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371050,61425010); NSF CCF(grant numbers:1218552); SRC Task(grant numbers:2347.001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7519041","Fast Fourier transform (FFT);integral equation (IE);low frequency;perturbation method","Kernel;Interpolation;Green's function methods;Integral equations;Fast Fourier transforms;Heuristic algorithms;Antennas","","8","","27","OAPA","22 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed RMCPs are based on dual-layer rectangular patches on both sides of a substrate, separated by a foam or air layer from the ground plane. Required TE susceptance of the first layer patches to produce circular polarization is calculated using the equivalent transmission line model. Dimensions of the RMCP are obtained using parametrical study for the two frequency bands, 1.9-2.3 GHz and 7.9-8.3 GHz. In addition, it is indicated that the accepted view angle and bandwidth of the proposed dual-layer RMCP are improved compared with the single layer RMCP, significantly. Moreover, a tradeoff is observed for the dual-layer RMCP on the bandwidths of X-band and S-band that can be controlled by propagation angle of the incident wave. The proposed RMCP has 30.5% and 33.7% bandwidths for less than 3 dB axial ratio with incident angles θmax = 50° and θmin = 35°. Finally, simulation results are met by the measurement for three angles of the incident wave.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2593931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7519070","Circular polarization (CP);dual frequency;dual-layer structure;frequency selective surfaces (FSSs)","Bandwidth;Dual band;Frequency selective surfaces;Reflection coefficient;Substrates;Power transmission lines;Atmospheric modeling","","17","","29","IEEE","22 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The analysis of the comment is built on a false assumption that the terminal current of an antenna fed by a waveguide is independent of frequency. This false assumption arises from the misunderstandings on the basic theory of transmission lines and misconceptions of normalization for a linear system. As a result, all the equations obtained from the assumption in the comment are incorrect, and the related discussions are not true. The delta gap source modeling has been abused in the comment, and this is reflected in the numerical results in the comment that give rise to negative stored energy. The main results of the commented paper have been misinterpreted, and the related analysis is established on illogical reasoning.
