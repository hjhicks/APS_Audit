Gain and noise measurements of a non-Foster matched small loop antenna were compared with those of the passive loop antenna to quantify the improvement in received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with non-Foster matching. The average gain improvement of 7 dB from 30-135 MHz was accompanied by an average added noise of 8.9 dB, indicating that the non-Foster matched antenna did not provide any improvement in the received SNR compared with the passive antenna. These results led to a study of the various noise sources in a non-Foster receiving system. Noise models were developed for the balanced and unbalanced Linvill negative impedance convertor circuits and verified with simulations. Simulations were then done to analyze the noise figure (NF) of a non-Foster receiving system for various small antennas, different biasing conditions, and receiver noise levels. These were then compared with NF simulations of small antennas attached to an amplifier and a noisy receiver. The results indicate that for receivers with low-noise floor levels, a receiving system consisting of a passive small antenna and an amplifier can provide better SNRs compared with a receiving system with a non-Foster matched small antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2617380","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1306055); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590047","Active antenna matching;antenna noise;negative impedance convertor (NIC);non-Foster circuit (NFC);signal-to-noise ratio (SNR);small antennas","Antenna measurements;Noise measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Gain;Receiving antennas","","34","","17","IEEE","13 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Modal analysis of a circular aperture cut on a finite square ground plane is presented in order to demonstrate that an optimum choice of the feeding mechanism can be made according to the current distribution of the desired modes. Based on the information yielded by this modal analysis, a capacitive-coupled dual-feed circular aperture antenna is presented. This antenna takes advantage of the symmetries of the characteristic currents by making use of multiple feeding, in order to excite only some particular modes. Usage of commonly-fed and differentially-fed configurations enables an increased control of the excitation of modes in the structure.

For this purpose, a pair of λ/4 microstrip-line resonators is introduced and coupled in proximity to a rectangular patch. The wideband property can be obtained by making effective use of the two resonances introduced by the radiating patch and nonradiating λ/4 resonators. Different from other reported dual-resonance patch antennas, the proposed antenna does not require the electrically thick substrate, so it has attractive low-profile property. Thanks to the good features of λ/4 resonators and capacitive feeding scheme, harmonic radiating modes of the patch antenna can be significantly suppressed as highly demanded in modern highly integrated communication systems. The working principle, equivalent circuit, and design procedure are extensively described. Finally, a prototype antenna operating at 4.9 GHz is designed and fabricated. The measured results show that its bandwidth is 2.7 times wider than that of the traditional insert-fed patch counterpart, and the harmful spurious radiation from other higher order radiating modes has been effectively suppressed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2618539","Macau Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:FDCT-051/2014/A1); University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2015-00010-FST,MYRG2014-00079-FST); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571468,61401208); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2014M561650); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7592896","Bandwidth enhancement;coupled feed;harmonic suppression;patch antenna;quarter-wave resonator","Patch antennas;Microstrip antennas;Substrates;Microstrip;Wideband","","149","","34","IEEE","19 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This characteristic is then utilized to design a planar crossed dipole ESPAR, termed as “CD-ESPAR.” Furthermore, a simple but effective impedance matching method is also proposed and analyzed. To verify these concepts, a prototype with compact size and very low profile (0.42 λ0 × 0.42 λ0 ×0.006 λ0) resonating at 2.3 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured results indicate that the proposed antenna achieves more than 17.8% impedance bandwidth and can produce four directional beams, covering the whole azimuth plane.

The magnitude and phase tuning of the desired modes is achieved by modifying the loop's geometry. The spherical modal spectrum at higher frequencies is also studied and the antenna's geometry is further modified to maintain constructive interference between the higher order spherical modes.

The deformation of the radiated pulse in the near-field is illustrated using the ideal dipole antenna radiation as well as by a Vivaldi antenna through full-wave simulations and measurements. The apparent superluminal pulse velocity is due to the pulse reshaping of the radiated pulse in the near-field of the antenna. The pulse velocity is measured by tracking pulse peak, pulse envelope peak, and also calculating the pulse centrovelocity. The superluminal pulse peak velocity of the radiated pulse from a miniaturized Vivaldi antenna is confirmed through measurements in face-to-face and quasi-monostatic radar configurations.

The interaction between MBFs is computed efficiently through a combination of the contour-fast Fourier transform (C-FFT) and interpolatory MBF-based techniques, which effectively deal with different parts of the printed structure. Substantial improvement is introduced to C-FFT by adding up the FFT tables before interpolating, which dramatically reduces the memory required to store the tables and accelerates the method-of-moment matrix filling time. The current on the antenna array and embedded element patterns (EEPs) are then rapidly obtained. Furthermore, an optimization method relying on sequential convex optimization and the fast full-wave scheme is proposed for the array synthesis. At each optimization iteration, EEPs are precomputed and assumed to be locally constant, which enables the implementation of convex programming to rapidly optimize the antenna positions. The EEPs are then quickly updated for the new antenna positions. The scheme enables the efficient inclusion of mutual coupling in array synthesis problems.

The high impedance metasurface (HIS) consists of an array of metallic elements printed on a thin dielectric substrate, placed over a ground plane, and supported by the actuators. Under a dc bias, the actuators produce a displacement between the two layers, resulting in a change in the reflection phase response. Furthermore, novel multilayer FSmSs are proposed achieving significant tuning of their passband response with low losses. The FSmSs consist of three closely spaced periodic arrays of subwavelength nonresonant elements, namely, an array of metallic square loops placed between two arrays of square apertures in metallic sheets, separated by air cavities. The combination of the square loop array and one of the square aperture arrays produces a high impedance surface response, which is tuned using the piezoelectric actuators. This in turn alters the resonance condition of the complete FSmS structure and thus the central frequency of the passband. The structures have been investigated through simulations and measurements with good agreement, achieving an experimental frequency tuning range of 17% for the HIS and of 8.8% for the FSmS as well as a maximum phase shift of over 177° for the HIS at approximately 14 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2617372","U.K. EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/J500367/1); Royal Academy of Engineering; Leverhulme Trust under a Senior Research Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590025","Frequency selective surfaces (FSSs);high impedance surfaces (HIS);piezoelectric actuators;reconfiguration","Actuators;Reflection;Cavity resonators;Surface impedance;Tuning;Impedance;Resonant frequency","","30","","35","CCBY","13 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the performance and applicability of such systems have been severely plagued by distortions due to the frequency-dependent nature of the amplitude response of the dispersive media. This frequency dependence is a fundamental consequence of causality, incarnated by Kramers-Kronig relations or, equivalently, by the Bode relations. In order to resolve this issue, we introduce here the concept of a perfect dispersive medium, which is a loss-gain medium characterized by a perfectly flat magnitude response along with a quasi-arbitrary phase response. This property results from equalized electric and magnetic dipole dispersions, whence the amplitude and phase of the transmission functions of the isolated loss and gain contributions become the inverse and remain the same, respectively, under sign reversal of the imaginary part of the equalized magnetodielectric polarizability. Such a perfect dispersive medium may be realized in the form of a metamaterial, and this paper demonstrates a corresponding stacked loss-gain metasurface structure for illustration. From a practical standpoint, perfect dispersive media may propel real-time signal processing technology to a new dimension, with a myriad of novel ultrafast communication, sensing, imaging, and instrumentation applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2623899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7728011","Chromatic dispersion;dispersion engineering;electromagnetic metamaterials;electromagnetic propagation;ultrafast electronics;ultrafast optics","Dispersion;Real-time systems;Metamaterials;Magnetic materials;Media;Delays","","6","","30","IEEE","1 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, because their exotic properties often arise from resonant structures, the large field enhancements under high-power microwave illumination can lead to dielectric breakdown and damage to the device. In order to develop metasurfaces and metamaterials capable of being utilized in high-power microwave applications, this paper investigates techniques for reducing the maximum field enhancement factor (MFEF) in several types of structures from the literature. Starting with a simple Sievenpiper metasurface, this paper evaluates the dependence of MFEF on the structure design parameters. For more complex metasurface geometries, a genetic algorithm is demonstrated that can evolve structures that have minimal MFEF. In addition, negative-index and low-index metamaterials are evaluated for field enhancement. By optimizing for low loss and by operating in the resonance tails, metamaterials with low MFEF can be realized for high-power applications. To illustrate this, a quad-beam focusing metamaterial lens is presented with an MFEF less than 5 over the entire operating band.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2623643","Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate(grant numbers:214-2014-M-59049); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7728038","Field enhancement;genetic algorithms (GAs);high-impedance surface;high-power microwave;metamaterials;metasurfaces;negative index;periodic structures;transformation optics (TO)","Metamaterials;Microwave antennas;Reflection;Microwave filters;Genetic algorithms","","23","","28","IEEE","1 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The advantage of this method is the independence of radiation patterns from the ground's physical and electromagnetic parameters (layer thickness, complex permittivity, permeability, and so on). The new matrix formulation efficiently calculates the impedance matrix due to the ground's contribution, with a loop over the ground parameters (permittivity, conductivity, and/or permeability), and changing the distance between antenna and ground. The number of samples in (complex) spectral domain is dramatically reduced by explicitly compensating truncation with aliasing errors in the spectral integration. To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, numerical results for 3-D metallic Vivaldi and typical dipole antennas are presented.

To be specific, the entire computational domain consisting of the object and its background is first decomposed into multiple nonoverlapping subdomains with each modeled by either an FE or BI equation. The equations in the subdomains are then coupled into a multisolver system by enforcing the RTC at the subdomain interfaces. Finally, the combined system is solved iteratively with the application of an extended preconditioner based on an absorbing boundary condition and the multilevel fast multipole algorithm. To obtain an accurate solution, both the Rao-Wilton-Glisson and the Buffa-Christiansen functions are employed as the testing functions to discretize the BI equations. This scheme is applied to a variety of benchmark problems and the scattering from an aircraft with a launched missile to demonstrate its accuracy, versatility, and capability.

It is shown that (if ω ≠ 0) the dispersion equation has a cubic and homogeneous form, whence the wave vector k is either zero or has arbitrary magnitude. In many cases there is no dispersion equation (“NDE medium”) to restrict the wave vector in an EME medium. Attention is paid to the case where the two medium dyadics have the same set of eigenvectors. In such a case the k vector is restricted to three eigenplanes defined by the medium dyadics. The emergence of such a result is demonstrated by considering a more regular medium, and taking the limit of zero permittivity and inverse permeability. The special case of uniaxial EME medium is studied in detail. It is shown that an interface of a uniaxial EME medium appears as a DB boundary when the axis of the medium is normal to the interface.

In fabricated devices, cylinders may be partially buried due to side effects of the fabrication process, or anchored intentionally for some applications. Our suggested method is a rigorous full-wave frequency-domain source-model technique. The cornerlike intersections of the cylinders with the substrate and superstrate cause computational difficulty, owing to rapid spatial variations of the fields in their vicinity. They are addressed with particular care, by intricately locating properly modulated fictitious sources using a novel algorithm. We show that expanding the scattered fields with the fields of these sources satisfies all boundary conditions and energy conservation requirements within very low error thresholds. The respective software tool is robust to the choice of materials, geometric parameters, and incident excitation. Sample results are presented for circular and trianglelike cylinders. These examples demonstrate the importance of precise geometric modeling for analyzing partially buried arrays.

Results indicate that the presence of the ground plane and/or vertical parallel-plate structures in the channel introduces multipath that, if constructively superimposed, may create a path loss lower than free-space propagation path loss. In addition, it has been found that a few centimeters of vertical misalignment between the transmitter and the receiver result in a path loss greater than 5 dB. Furthermore, the results indicate that vertical components such as dual in-line memory modules with reflection coefficient close to one for all incident angles can be used to create directed non-line-of-sight (LoS) links with wide coherence bandwidth. Finally, for LoS propagation obstructed by large objects, such as a heatsink, the path-loss exponent of 1.77 is found, while the rotating fan causes periodic fading in the received power, indicating that channel equalization techniques will be needed to overcome deep fades. All these results indicate that optimal communications can be achieved by carefully positioning the antennas with respect to the motherboard layout.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2620598","NSF(grant numbers:1318934); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7636947","Channel characterization;channel measurements;channel sounding;chip-to-chip wireless channels;terahertz (THz) communications","Antenna measurements;Computers;Wireless communication;Bandwidth;Propagation losses;OFDM;Frequency measurement","","65","","35","IEEE","24 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A current continuity boundary condition is introduced on the interface between contiguous subdomains to guarantee the accuracy. Moreover, the FAFFA technique is utilized to speed up the process of updating the modified excitation vectors.

Through the theoretical analysis of the effective phase constants of the SC, it is found that two space harmonic modes (m = -1 and m = -2) can be simultaneously excited (above the air line) within a certain frequency range. This phenomenon leads to the generation of two radiation beams in the far-field region. At the frequency where the phase constants satisfy β-1 = -β-2, the two beams are in symmetric directions with respect to the axis that is perpendicular to the azimuth plane. Different from the conventional periodic structures that the m = -2 mode lacks well control, the proposed antenna can manipulate both modes and obtain equal performance for the two radiation beams. In this communication, the symmetric beam case is investigated. The detailed design principle is presented. In addition, the frequency-based beam steering characteristic that the two beams scan in the same clockwise or anticlockwise direction is discussed as well.
