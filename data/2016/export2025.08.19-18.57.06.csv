To compensate the effects of the manufacturing errors, a novel shape control procedure, which takes the RF performance into consideration, is presented. Both the boundary cables and the tension ties are selected as adjustable cables. Sensitivity analysis is adopted to evaluate the influence of the unstrained cable lengths on the RF performance and cable tensions. The antenna performance is finally expressed as the incremental form of the adjustable cable lengths on the basis of the sensitivity analysis. A mathematical model of the shape control procedure is established and solved using optimization strategy. The proposed shape control method is applied to a 10-m diameter cable-network antenna. Numerical results show that the directivity of the antenna is more sensitive to the boundary cable lengths, while the tension in a cable is much more sensitive to the length changes of itself, the cables connected to it, and the boundary cables. Comparisons of the directivities and tensions before and after shape control demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed shape control method and recommend the antenna RF performance as the shape control objective.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2513088","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51035006,51175398,51305323); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities(grant numbers:JY10000904019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368133","Cable-network antennas;Shape control;RF performance;Cable-network antennas;cable tensions;optimization strategy;RF performance;sensitivity analysis;shape control","Radio frequency;Shape control;Shape;Reflector antennas;Optical surface waves;Sensitivity","","9","","21","IEEE","29 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fundamental TE01 mode is excited by the IDW with the leaky wave generated by the SM inset groove depth. The electric field is normal to the metallic waveguide wall and thus reduces the conductor loss. As a proof of concept, the modulated dielectric inset as well as the dielectric transition are conveniently fabricated by 3-D printing (tan δ = 0.02). Measurements of the antenna prototype show that the main beam can be scanned from -9° to 40° in a frequency range from 50 to 85 GHz within a gain variation between 9.1 and 14.2 dBi. Meanwhile, the reflection coefficient |S11| is kept below -13.4 dB over the whole frequency band. The measured results agree reasonably well with simulations.

In order to retrieve these parameters from QZ spherical near-field measurements, the transmission formula is adapted to the case where the output signal of a virtually positioned output probe-antenna can be calculated on arbitrary locations inside the QZ. The output probe-antenna can be a measured or theoretically defined antenna and can be rotated in any direction of interest. This paper will show that this method provides similar results as industry standard linear field-probing by comparing amplitude taper and ripple extracted from both measurements.

Lumped resistors with different values are fixed on each side of all three loops, while PIN switches are optionally fixed parallel to the lumped resistors on the specific loop. When the switches are turned off, the parallel lumped resistors become operational, the present integrated structure acts lossy and performs broadband absorption function. When switches are turned on, those parallel lumped resistors are shorted, the corresponding loop structure can be regarded lossless, acting as a patch antenna. Second, equivalent circuit models of the present structure of absorber and radiator are developed and analyzed, respectively, to explain the working principle of the present structure.

Unlike the commonly used approaches, the distance (F) between a source antenna and a reflectarray is largely narrowed in this work, which is no longer than 0.3λ. Accordingly, the total area occupied by the reflectarray can also be reduced with almost no decline in performance. Instead of a directional antenna, a simple omnidirectional dipole antenna is used as a feeding source, which has traditionally been expected to lower aperture efficiency of the proposed antenna. To solve this problem, an additional condition to maximize antenna gain in a target direction is suggested, which applies to both waves reflected from the reflectarray and radiated directly from the source. Moreover, by assuming that an incident plane wave coming from a far-field region, ambiguity in the polarization and incidence angle of the incident field impinging onto the reflectarray can clearly be removed. As a result, a relatively high aperture efficiency and antenna gain can be maintained in spite of the extremely reduced volume that is more than 700 times electrically smaller than the conventional ones. Good agreement between the experiment and the prediction confirms the validity of our approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2517676","Mid-career Researcher Program(grant numbers:NRF-2014R1A2A2A01007708); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MISP) of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381648","reflectarray;scanned beam;high aperture efficiency;high gain;miniaturization;High aperture efficiency;high gain;miniaturization;reflectarray;scanned beam","Reflector antennas;Dipole antennas;Reflection;Delays;Aperture antennas;Antenna feeds","","9","","15","IEEE","13 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to suppress the edge diffraction, the serrated edge design method is proposed. According to the equivalence principle, a field uniformity analysis method was proposed to compute the spatial field distribution radiated from the aperture of a beam combiner. In order to separate the direct wave from diffracted wave, the spatial field is transformed into the time- and angular-domain spectrum by inverse Fourier transform. First, the height of serrations is designed by analog of the equivalent trapezoidal amplitude taper. Then, the number of serrations was designed by the assumption of isosceles and right triangles. Finally, the shape of serrations was designed by changing the interior angle of serrations. A serrated edge design example is also proposed and analyzed. By comparing the field uniformity in spatial, time, and angular domains before and after serrating the edges, the amplitude and phase ripples decrease from 1.85 dB and 12.16° to 0.53 dB and 3.98°, respectively.

The hybrid method is composed of three steps combining the capabilities of the LSM, the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, and the generalized multipole technique (GMT). Initially, a new measure of the noise level of the multistatic response (MSR) matrix is proposed. Subsequently, the LSM is applied using the Tikhonov regularization. Then, the scattered field is back-propagated into the investigation domain using the GMT, where in order to ensure the stability, a MUSIC-based approach is exploited to determine the optimum reconstructing multipole sources. The case of limited scattered field data is also addressed by introducing a modification of the Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm (PGA). Finally, the boundary and the dielectric constant of each scatterer are obtained simultaneously by solving an inverse boundary value problem through an optimization. The proposed hybrid approach is capable of efficiently approximating the dielectric constant of multiple homogeneous dielectric scatterers in a parallel manner. The effectiveness of the proposed method and the accuracy of the solutions are demonstrated by applying the method to both numerical and measured data.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2515124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373589","Inverse problems;Microwave imaging;Electromagnetic scattering inverse problems;Electromagnetic scattering inverse problems;inverse problems;microwave imaging","Inverse problems;Antennas;Dielectric constant;Sampling methods;Noise measurement;Dielectric measurement","","11","","57","IEEE","6 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonuniform sampling is implemented in Cauchy method such that any additional samples and any a priori information can be added to the existing sample set to continuously improve the interpolation result. In this proposed algorithm, the sample set is automatically adjusted according to the nature of the given data, so that the computational load is minimized by taking the least number of sample points while still maintaining high interpolation accuracy.

This is achieved by inverse Laplace transformation of the frequency-domain scattering solution. To improve understanding of the scattering mechanism from a uniaxial dielectric sphere, two different frequency-domain solutions are employed. In the first approach, the impulse and step responses of a uniaxial dielectric sphere are evaluated by the Mie series solution. Following the high-frequency (HF) scattering solution of a large uniaxial sphere, the Mie series summation is split into high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency terms where the HF term is replaced by its asymptotic expression allowing a significant reduction in computation time of the numerical Bromwich integral. In the second approach, the generalized Debye series solution is introduced, and the generalized Mie series coefficients are replaced by their equivalent Debye series formulations. The results are then applied to evaluate the transient response of each individual Debye term allowing the identification of impulse returns in the transient response of a uniaxial sphere. The effect of variation in permittivity on the arrival time as well as amplitudes of each impulse return is studied, and the results are compared with those computed using the Mie series solution.

Each layer in the structure (overall sandwiched between two half-spaces) consists of a dielectric material within which an infinite chain of periodically arranged and arbitrarily orientated circular cylinders is embedded. The orientations of the cylinder arrays in different layers are arbitrary with respect to one another, offering full generality. The above is a model of fiber-reinforced composite laminates as in industry but also of multilayered photonic crystals. Combining Rayleigh's method and mode-matching produces scattering matrices for each layer cascaded from the top to the bottom in order to relate the reflection/transmission coefficients to the incident field. Power reflection and transmission coefficients follow from Poynting's theorem. The mathematical derivation insists on modal representations and building up proper S-matrices. Numerical simulations show that the model is accurate, known results on woodpile structures in photonics are in particular recovered. The model is also versatile in terms of illuminations, geometries, and material parameters. The results could also be used as benchmarks in view of lack of data in present-day literature on such arbitrarily orientated layerings.

This antenna is composed of a slot-coupled microstrip patch and a two-layer metastructure. The top-layer metastructure integrates a partially reflection surface (PRS) with an absorbing surface, and the bottom-layer one consists of tunable reflection phase cells, which are loaded around the antenna source. The absorbing surface can absorb most of the incoming wave, and thus reduce the antenna RCS. The PRS and tunable reflection phase cells form a Fabry-Perot resonance cavity, making the antenna produce a highly directive beam. In addition, the operation frequency can be dynamically tuned by controlling the varactor diodes in the reflection phase cells. Both simulated and measured results have verified that employing the two-layer metastructure makes the antenna RCS largely reduced at a wide band ranging from 8 to 14 GHz. Compared with the traditional microstrip antenna, this antenna radiates a highly directive beam with gain enhancement of about 7 dB, and its operation frequency can be actively tuned from 9.05 to 10 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2518199","973 Program of China(grant numbers:2013CBA01700); National Natural Science Funds(grant numbers:61475160); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383238","low-RCS;high-gain antenna;tunable frequency;metastructure;High-gain antenna;low-radar cross section (RCS);metastructure;tunable frequency","Reflection;Directive antennas;Cavity resonators;Surface waves;Reflector antennas;Capacitance","","83","","26","IEEE","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
