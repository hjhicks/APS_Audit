Loop antennas offer better user experience than conventional planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs), inverted-F antennas (IFAs), and monopole antennas because of their unique balanced modes (1λ, 2λ, ...). However, the bandwidth of loop antennas is usually narrower than that of PIFA/IFA and monopole antennas due to these balanced modes. To overcome this problem, a novel monopole/dipole parasitic element, which operates at an unbalanced monopole-like 0.25λ mode and a balanced dipole-like 0.5λ mode, is first proposed for loop antennas to cover more frequency bands. Benefiting from the balanced mode, the proposed parasitic element is promising to provide better user experience than conventional parasitic elements. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the balanced mode for a parasitic element is reported for the first time. The proposed antenna is able to provide excellent user experience while solving the problem of limited bandwidth in loop antennas. To validate the concept, one prototype antenna with a size of 75 × 10 × 5 mm3 is designed, fabricated, and measured. Both simulations and experimental results are presented and discussed. Good performance is achieved.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2582919","Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd., China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500124","Handset antennas;long-term evolution (LTE) antenna;loop antennas;LTE-Licensed Assisted Access (LTELAA);LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U);mobile antennas;multiband antenna;parasitic element","Bandwidth;Mobile antennas;Dipole antennas;Couplings;Long Term Evolution;Current distribution","","88","","29","CCBY","27 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is known that an S-SRR coupled to a coplanar waveguide (CPW) provides a stopband in the transmission characteristic of the line. It is shown here that this behavior of the S-SRR can be switched between fundamental resonance and second harmonic response by introduction of a p-i-n diode in the center segment of the S-SRR. Alternatively, if the S-SRR is loaded with a varactor diode instead of a switch, the frequency of the stopband can be continuously tuned from the S-SRRs fundamental resonance frequency to its second harmonic. Furthermore, it is shown that if a pair of shunt p-i-n diodes are introduced across the slots of the host CPW, the structure can be reconfigured from a bandstop to a bandpass structure. Thus, the proposed resonator structure can be used as the building block of reconfigurable (bandstop/bandpass) filters with tunable operating frequency.

There are surprisingly few hybrid-free, intrinsically dual CP microstrip antenna (MSA) designs in the literature. One reason for this is that it is challenging to obtain high isolation between ports while maintaining low return loss and good polarization quality. To resolve this problem, a method for multicriterion design optimization of dual-CP MSAs is proposed. The method is based on an accurate equivalent circuit model combined with a Jones matrix representation of the antenna response. The model explains the counter-intuitive tradeoff between cross-polarization isolation and impedance mismatch factor. The model also provides an analytical relationship between axial ratio bandwidth and impedance bandwidth, and allows the Wheeler cap method to be generalized to multiport, dual polarization antennas. Based on insights provided by the analysis, an effective matching and decoupling scheme is proposed, leading to an intrinsically dual CP MSA design that is competitive in performance with a dual linear antenna combined with a hybrid. Results are validated by comparison to full wave simulations for practical dual CP antenna examples.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2583461","Linear Signal LLC; Utah NASA EPSCoR Research Student Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497524","Decoupling network;dual circular polarization (CP);equivalent circuit model;fundamental limit;Jones matrix;microstrip antenna (MSA);Wheeler cap","Integrated circuit modeling;Ports (Computers);Microstrip antennas;RLC circuits;Equivalent circuits;Transmission line matrix methods","","10","","36","IEEE","22 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These metasurfaces, characterized by electric surface impedance, magnetic surface admittance, and magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, were previously considered for wavefront manipulation. However, previous reports mainly considered plane-wave excitations, and implementations included cumbersome metallic features. In this paper, we prove that any field transformation that locally conserves real power can be implemented via passive and lossless meta-atoms characterized by closed-form expressions; this allows rigorous incorporation of arbitrary source and scattering configurations. Subsequently, we show that O-BMS meta-atoms can be implemented using an asymmetric stack of three impedance sheets, an appealing structure for printed circuit board fabrication. Our formulation reveals that, as opposed to Huygens' metasurfaces, which exhibit negligible magnetoelectric coupling, O-BMSs are not limited to controlling the phase of transmitted fields, but can rather achieve a high level of control over the amplitude and phase of reflected fields. This is demonstrated by designing O-BMSs for reflectionless wide-angle refraction, independent surface-wave guiding, and a highly directive low-profile antenna, verified with full-wave simulations. This straightforward methodology facilitates the development of O-BMS-based devices for controlling the near and far fields of arbitrary sources in complex scattering configurations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2588495","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506314","Bianisotropy;field transformations;high-gain antennas;metasurfaces;refraction;wavefront manipulation","Magnetoelectric effects;Surface impedance;Impedance;Magnetic resonance;Surface waves;Antennas","","269","","48","IEEE","7 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These BCs well represent a dense distribution of subwavelength metal patches of infinitesimal thickness, printed on a grounded slab. We denote succinctly this theoretical formulation as flat optics for LWs. This formulation is based on an adiabatic, asymptotic form of the Floquet theorem, introduced here for the first time. The adiabatic Floquet-wave analysis allows for: 1) describing the mechanism of global interaction between the cylindrical surface wave (SW) launched by the dipole and the modulated MTS; 2) introducing a generalized curvilinear-wavefront LW field that can be used for controlling the radiation-pattern shaping; 3) describing the local and global transfer of energy from SW to LW; 4) establishing an analytical relationship between the aperture field polarization and the anisotropic parameters of the MTS and 5) between the leakage parameter α and the MTS modulation index. Concerning the latter point, a closed-form formula for α is introduced, which allows for unprecedented control of the aperture field amplitude. The theoretical results are successfully validated by comparison with a full-wave analysis, showing impressive accuracy.

These antennas are based on the interaction between a cylindrical surface-wave and the periodic modulation of the MTS, which leads to radiation through a leaky-wave (LW) effect. This new design method permits a systematic and simple synthesis of amplitude, phase, and polarization of the aperture field by designing the boundary conditions imposed by the MTS. The polarization control is based on the local value of the MTS anisotropy, the phase is controlled by the shape and periodicity of the modulation, and the amplitude is controlled by the local leakage attenuation parameter of the LW.

It is assumed that no field variation exists in axial (z) direction. Implementation of boundary conditions on scatterer surface leads to a system of linearly independent equations to solve for equivalent surface currents. Scattered fields are calculated by equivalent surface currents leading to evaluation of scattering widths (Radar Cross-Section of 2-D objects) for different observation angles. TMz polarized incident wave does not excite any TEz component. The novelty of proposed method is use of addition theorem of Bessel functions for representation of scattered fields in terms of equivalent surface currents, giving an integral equation with an analytic integrand and a well-behaved impedance matrix. Orthogonality of cylindrical modes results in excitation matrix to be a discrete function of mode numbers. Therefore, contrary to method of moments, there is no need for weighting functions.

The field synthesis relies on the stochastic approach proposed by Bell and requires as input the average integrated water vapor content provided with coarse spatial and temporal resolution by numerical weather prediction (NWP) products. The vertical profile of v is modeled as a simple exponential function decreasing with height, as observed from typical radiosonde observations and NWP data.

Studies show that these tools work well when the impulse response consists only of a few distinct components. However, measurements of the channel impulse response in indoor environments reveal a diffuse tail. This diffuse tail is difficult to include in ray tracing due to the computational complexity. We propose a hybrid model to include deterministic components and the diffuse tail by combining ray tracing with a propagation graph. The recursive structure of the propagation graph allows for a computationally efficient calculation of the channel transfer function considering infinitely many components.

We develop a comprehensive statistical propagation channel model based on high-resolution extraction of multipath components and subsequent spatiotemporal clustering analysis. The intracluster direction of departure (DoD), direction of arrival (DoA), and the time of arrival (ToA) are independent, both for the LOS and NLOS scenarios. The intracluster DoD and DoA can be approximated by the Laplace distribution, and the intracluster ToA can be approximated by an exponential mixture distribution. The intercluster analysis, however, shows a dependency between the cluster DoD, DoA, and ToA. To capture this dependency, we separately model the clusters caused by single and multiple bounce scattering along the aisles in the warehouse. The intercluster DoD distribution follows a Laplace distribution, while the cluster DoA conditioned on the DoD is approximated by a Gaussian mixture distribution.

Two pyramidal horn antennas with opposite positions are employed to feed the reflectarray for vertical and horizontal polarizations, respectively.

To realize the dual-band operation, one dimension of the patches is adjusted to direct the beam at the lower band in vertical polarization, whereas the other orthogonal dimension is tuned to focus the beam at the upper band in horizontal polarization. The measured results show that the proposed dual-band reflectarray can realize a broad 1.5-dB gain bandwidth of 24% and 21% with aperture efficiency of 48% and 38% for the lower and upper band, respectively, which demonstrates better behavior than various existing dual-band designs adopting traditional square grids.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2574920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482800","Dual-band reflectarray;rectangular patch;single layer;subwavelength","Dual band;Broadband antennas;Bandwidth;Feeds;Gain measurement;Substrates;Reflector antennas","","33","","26","IEEE","1 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When applied to the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, the concept of the scattered field results in the FDTD method of the scattered-field formulation. It is shown that such an FDTD can produce significant errors in the distribution of the scattered near-field behind a perfect shield of infinite transverse dimensions. Nevertheless, our numerical technique for computing the values of the plane-wave scattering coefficients is still shown to be very accurate in spite of these errors, because scattering parameters are far-field parameters and because these scattered near-field errors consist of evanescent fields that do not subsist in the far-field. Therefore, the FDTD method of the scattered-field formulation and, by the same token, the concept of the scattered field can be used reliably for computing far-field parameters (e.g., plane-wave scattering coefficients, radiation patterns, and radar cross section), but they should be used with caution for computing near-field parameters (e.g., near-field distribution, input impedance, and specific absorption rate).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2583462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497492","Evanescent waves;finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods;scattering parameters","Finite difference methods;Antennas;Scattering;Time-domain analysis;Steady-state;Boundary conditions;Slabs","","1","","5","IEEE","22 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Checkerboard surfaces, combining two different EBG structures each on a quadrant of the same ground plane, can realize a wide frequency bandwidth for the 10-dB RCS reduction, because the scattered fields from checkerboard surfaces are redirected toward four quadrants. This communication proposes dual-frequency band checkerboard surfaces with 10-dB RCS reduction bandwidths of 61% and 24% by utilizing two dual-band EBG structures, while the surfaces maintain scattering in four quadrants. Bistatic and monostatic RCS of dualband checkerboard surfaces are simulated and the results are compared to the RCS of the corresponding perfect electric conductor (PEC) surface. Comparison of the monostatic RCS between the measurements and simulations, as a function of frequency, is considered for both TEz and TMz polarizations. A very good agreement is obtained between measurements and simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2583505","ASU Advanced Helicopter Electromagnetics (AHE) Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497507","Checkerboard surfaces;dual band;EBG structures;scattering","Periodic structures;Metamaterials;Bandwidth;Dual band;Resonant frequency;Frequency measurement;Scattering","","93","1","10","IEEE","22 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The equivalent circuit models of monopole, annular slot, and their combination are derived to aid the RF system analysis with this antenna, herein referred to as a combined annular slot-monopole antenna. The proposed antenna is designed using full-wave and circuit simulations and the theory is experimentally validated. The measured VSWR is below 2 from 17.9 to 50 GHz. A consistent far-field characterized with monopole-like E-plane pattern, flat gain around 5.5±1 dBi, and good omnidirectionality (<;2.5 dB) is preserved over the bandwidth. To further reduce in-band mismatch losses, a concentric ring atop the monopole is introduced and VSWR below 1.5 is achieved from 18.5 to 47.4 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2583540","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N000141310537,N00014-11-1-0818); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497604","Annular slot;equivalent circuit;millimeter wave;monopole;omnidirectional;wideband antennas","Impedance;Bandwidth;Slot antennas;Integrated circuit modeling;Equivalent circuits;Antenna radiation patterns;Wires","","16","","18","IEEE","22 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two different feed configurations have been considered, namely, a single focal source and a four-element focal source configuration. The latter enables the simultaneous generation of a Σ- and two A-patterns in orthogonal planes, which is an important advantage for tracking applications with stringent requirements in speed and accuracy.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2586491","French Ministry of Defense (Direction Générale de l’Armement); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502105","Beam steering;electronically reconfigurable array;monopulse radar;planar lens;radiation pattern synthesis;transmitarray","Gain;Antenna radiation patterns;Transmitting antennas;Radar applications;Radar antennas;Phased arrays","","50","","27","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
