The ZPSL loop is first analyzed with a full-wave driven-mode solver to obtain the dispersion curve. An equivalent circuit model is then presented for characterizing the ZPSL structure. Based on the dispersion analysis, a design guideline is proposed for the ZPSL loop antenna to enlarge its interrogation zone, where a uniform magnetic field distribution is desired. A design example at 915 MHz shows that the perimeter of the ZPSL loop antenna with a desired uniform magnetic field distribution can be optimized up to 2.5λ0, which is much larger than those reported with 2λ0, achieving a 56% increase in the area of the interrogation zone.

The electric one is based on a modified Egyptian axe dipole NFRP element; the magnetic one is based on a capacitively loaded loop NFRP element. In both cases, the driven element is a simple coax-fed dipole antenna, and there is no ground plane. By organically combining these two elements, Huygens source antennas are obtained.

The SIR is composed of two distinctive portions: the radiating patch and a pair of open stubs. Initially, based on the transmission line model, the first and second odd-order radiative resonant modes, i.e., TM10 and TM30, of this SIR-typed patch antenna are extensively investigated. It is demonstrated that the frequency ratio between the dual-resonant modes can be fully controlled by the electrical length and the impedance ratios between the open stub and radiating patch. After that, the SIR-typed patch antenna is reshaped with stepped ground plane in order to increase the impedance ratio as highly required for wideband radiation. With this arrangement, these two radiative modes are merged with each other, resulting in a wide impedance bandwidth with a stable radiation pattern under dual-resonant radiation. Finally, the proposed antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured. It is verified in experiment that the impedance bandwidth (|Sdd11| <; -10 dB) of the proposed antenna has gained tremendous increment up to 10% (0.85-0.94 GHz) with two attenuation poles.

A methodology for analyzing the random arrays is provided, multiple cases with different numbers of PSs and subarray groups are optimized, and design guidelines are presented. The performance of the random arrays is compared with conventional uniform subarrays and it is shown that random arrays reduce the number of PSs by up to 40% while preserving the same performance. A random array is demonstrated at 7.9 GHz for a 30-element linear design (scan in one direction) with 12 PSs and results in a half-power beamwidth of 4.1° with a scan angle up to ±14° and SLLs less than -15 dB.

Aligned electric and magnetic dipoles excited in chiral structures contribute to the extraordinary properties. However, the chiral structures that exhibit n-fold rotational symmetry show a limited tunability of the chirality. In this paper, we propose a compact, light, and highly tunable anisotropic chiral structure to overcome this limitation and realize a linear-to-circular polarization conversion. The anisotropy is due to simultaneous excitations of two different pairs of aligned electric and magnetic dipoles. The 3-D omega-shaped structure, etched on two sides of one printed circuit board (PCB) with connecting metallic vias, achieves 60% of linear-to-circular conversion (transmission) efficiency at the operating frequency of 9.2 GHz. The desired 90° phase shift between the two orthogonal linear polarizations is not only from the chirality but also from the anisotropic chiral response slightly off the resonance.

At an internal resonance of an object there is a component of the resonant current on the structure which is real and that current does not radiate nor does it couple to the incident field. The external resonances responsible for radiation that occurs at the singularities in the complex s-plane and lead to the currents that are complex in nature. These are the same solutions as discussed in the singularity expansion method and are responsible for radiation. This paper also illustrates that the nature of the current distribution on a radiating structure cannot be correlated with the amount of radiation emanating from the structure and nor do the currents have to be real and thus correlating them to resonances. Another topic to be discussed is the characteristic modes that can not only represent the currents on the structure but also the fields on the radiation sphere provided there is no internal resonances associated with this structure. In addition, the structure has to be completely lossless. These characteristic modes can also be correlated with the properties of the impedance matrix that are generated in a numerical electromagnetic field configuration. For computational purposes for the characteristic modes to exist the impedance matrix must be symmetric in order to generate real eigenvalues and a real orthogonal basis for the currents (that does not mean the actual currents are real-the basis functions are real in most of the deployments encountered in the solution of method of moments problems). This expansion in terms of the characteristic modes is valid provided the structure has no internal resonances at the frequency of analysis, the impedance matrix that is to be decomposed is perfectly symmetric and the structure has no losses. Finally, it is illustrated that the nature of radiation cannot be predicted from the solution of the current distribution on the structure. Just because the current distribution on the structure is real that does not mean it will provide enhanced radiation. On the contrary real resonant currents could be due to internal resonances and they do not radiate. These points are discussed in this short presentation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2598281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7533461","Characteristic modes;external resonance;internal resonance;method of moments (MoM);singularity expansion method (SEM)","Resonant frequency;Impedance;Integral equations;Dipole antennas;Current distribution;Symmetric matrices","","25","","10","IEEE","4 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The directivity of the expansion sources is either obtained by combining electric and magnetic surface current densities in a directive Huygens radiator or by shifting the source locations into complex space. The latter approach is known to generate Gaussian-beam-like directive radiators. These two techniques can be used separately or in combination to obtain three different solutions that approximately satisfy the null-field condition (also known as the Love condition) outside the solution domain, i.e., inside the volume of the original device under test. The directive sources lead to a better conditioning of the inverse problem and especially the Huygens radiator concept leads to good conditioning for a small number of unknowns. Thus, considerable reduction in computation times and better solution accuracies are achieved. Moreover, antenna diagnostics is promoted by the improved localization of the directive equivalent sources. The directive sources are implemented together with Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions and the new concepts are utilized within the fast irregular antenna field transformation algorithm with its hierarchical propagating plane wave-based radiation operator representation. This algorithm has recently been augmented with Gaussian beam-based translation operators which lead to considerably reduced computation times and lower memory requirements. The algorithmic capabilities are demonstrated with synthetically generated near-field data as well as with real spherical measurements of a double-ridged waveguide antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2606405","U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7562564","Antenna diagnostics;antenna measurements;complex sources;directive sources;Huygens source;integral equations;inverse problems","Magnetic domains;Current density;Directive antennas;Antenna measurements;Probes;Green's function methods;Magnetic resonance","","37","","40","IEEE","7 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We discuss the limitations of existing patterning techniques, and explore options for generating anisotropic impedance surfaces with arbitrary spatial variation. We present an approach that allows a wide range of anisotropic impedance profiles, based on a point-shifting method combined with a Voronoi cell generation technique. This approach can be used to produce patterns which include highly elongated cells with varying orientation, and cells which can smoothly transition between square, rectangular, hexagonal, and other shapes with a wide range of aspect ratios. We demonstrate a practical implementation of this technique which allows us to define gaps between the cells to generate impedance surfaces, and we use it to implement a simple example of a structure which requires smoothly varying impedance, in the form of a planar Luneberg lens.

Instead of taking advantage of all four possible combinations of the polarizations of transmit and receive antennas as in the typical full-polarimetric imaging systems, the suggested antenna array acquires three different copolarized measurements at each spatial sampling point with its rotation. A simple algebraic operation is derived to accurately retrieve the full-polarimetric signals in the H/V polarization basis from the copolarized measurements. After the retrieval of the full-polarimetric signals, the traditional imaging algorithms can be applied to reconstruct the polarimetric images. The effectiveness and accuracy of the suggested approach to full-polarimetric imaging are validated on the signal and image levels through both numerical simulations and experiments. The results show that the proposed approach can accurately retrieve the full-polarimetric signals and provides an alternative method to signal acquisition for full-polarimetric imaging.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2610102","NeTTUN Project Funded by the European Commission within the FP-7 Framework(grant numbers:280712); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7569079","Copolarized data;full-polarimetric imaging;rotating array;signal retrieve;ultrawideband (UWB)","Receiving antennas;Imaging;Antenna arrays;Radar imaging;Antenna measurements;Transmitting antennas;Scattering","","10","","30","IEEE","15 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, each transverse plane is divided into two regions, which are a small region around the target and an outer region combined with the air layer and a perfect matching layer. The ADI scheme is applied to the small region, whereas the AGE scheme is introduced to the outer region. In this manner, only a few matrix equations are needed to be solved for the small region and the unknowns of the outer region can be directly obtained without solving any matrix equations. Therefore, the CPU time can be reduced significantly by the proposed method and it can be easily adapted to the parallel technology.

The proposed reflectarray uses the unit cells of ground-plane-backed, anisotropic miniaturized-element frequency selective surfaces as its spatial time-delay units (TDUs). Each TDU is composed of a stack of nonresonant rectangular-shaped capacitive patches featuring asymmetric gap spacings and separated from one another by thin dielectric substrates. The TDUs are designed to provide a reflection phase difference of 90° between the horizontal and vertical components of the incident wave over a wide bandwidth. This way, a linearly polarized incident field is converted to a circularly polarized radiated wave. A device prototype that operates at X-band is designed, fabricated, and measured. Measurement results demonstrated that the reflectarray antenna provides a gain of 23.7 dB with variations less than 3 dB within the 8-12 GHz operating frequency range or equivalently 40% bandwidth. Time-domain measurement results demonstrate the suitability of this device for operation with wideband pulses. The reflectarray is also used in a multibeam antenna and it is shown that the structure provides a wide-angle scanning performance with a field of view of ±45°.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2596900","Office of Naval Research under ONR(grant numbers:N00014-16-1-2308); National Science Foundation under NSF(grant numbers:ECCS-1101146); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7527667","Antenna arrays;circular polarization;frequency selective surfaces;periodic structures;reflectarrays;true-time-delay arrays","Apertures;Broadband antennas;Delays;Bandwidth;Antenna feeds","","43","","27","IEEE","1 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The loading is formed by a stack of modified rectangular split-ring resonators, which are placed very closely in parallel. With the presence of the metamaterials, the effective permeability of the substrate is increased, and therefore the antenna finds a significant size reduction.

Using two different stacking materials enables the generation of different effective permittivities ex' and ey' for the wave components propagating in-between an antenna and a ground. The idea is to modify the antenna polarization by exploiting reflections from a ground in a way that CP operation is obtained. By properly designing the AAAS, the radiator shape can be maintained simple. The operation of AAAS is demonstrated for substrates made of homogeneous anisotropic and thin sheets.
