The design is based on an open substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) implemented with RO 4003 substrate, aiming to miniature the cavity and suited for fabrication with printed-circuit board (PCB) technology. A pair of vias is used to tune the resonances of the cavity for dual-band operation [2.45 and 5-GHz wireless local area network (WLAN) bands], and an open-loop resonator is introduced to enhance the bandwidth. The cavity antenna is fed by a stripline to avoid cross coupling with other devices. Evaluations have been performed both in freespace (FS) and inside multiple metallic cavities. Operating from within the cavities, a good antenna performance is obtained with a maximum -10-dB bandwidth of 4% at 2.45 GHz and 25% at 5.5 GHz. Simulations and measurements agree well. As a proof of concept, the proposed antenna was connected to several WLAN modules inside realistic metallic cavity environments and its operation was evaluated in a realistic indoor environment. These real-life tests confirm that the maximum data rate of 54 Mb/s is obtained for most practical situations, in which the antenna has to operate.",1558-2221,,10.1109/TAP.2016.2539374,"AGFA Healthcare, Mortsel; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7428845,Open waveguide antennas;slot antennas;WLAN antennas;Open waveguide antennas;slot antennas;wireless local area network (WLAN) antennas,Cavity resonators;Slot antennas;Wireless LAN;Topology;Antenna measurements;Substrates,,5,,16,IEEE,8 Mar 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Various interdigitated capacitor (IC) loading schemes for a metallic sheet backed MS are investigated, which provide footprint miniaturization and bandwidth enhancement. A linearly polarized (LP) MS-based antenna, loaded by ICs, provides a 15% impedance bandwidth and a gain higher than 6.67 dBi. The radiation mechanism and resonant frequency dependence were revealed via a dispersion analysis, which serves to explain the working principle of the proposed antenna. Next, a miniaturized antenna with doubly loaded ICs was introduced, achieving an impedance bandwidth of 10%, a gain above 6 dBi, and a more than 30% footprint reduction. A more advanced compact, circularly polarized (CP) MS-based antenna with a compact footprint, and improved 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth were also presented, by introducing triangular IC and diagonal slot loadings to the MS. It is demonstrated that this antenna achieves an impedance bandwidth of 16%, a gain above 5.5 dBi, and an AR <;3 dB bandwidth of 10%.

First, required mode content factors and tapering numbers of the TE11 mode are addressed for the y-polarized case in offset reflectors with different focal length-to-diameter ratios. Then, the model is appropriately tailored for the x-polarized primary feeds. It is shown that when the polarization orientation changes, the corresponding beamwidths of the TE11 mode should be swapped in the principal Eand H-planes.

Mutual Coupling Mitigation in Broadband Multiple-Antenna Communication Systems Using Feedforward Technique,S. M. Amjadi; K. Sarabandi,"Radiation Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Radiation Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,3 May 2016,2016,64,5,1642,1652,"An efficient method to mitigate the forward scattering (shadowing) effect and the near-field coupling among elements of broadband multiple-antenna communication systems is proposed. The technique is based on provision of a passive feedforward coupling among elements to cancel out the mutual couplings. Electrical current paths, with appropriate shape, location, and length, between adjacent elements are established to provide current distributions on adjacent elements that are approximately equal in magnitude and out of phase with the induced current on the same antenna due to the near-field coupling and scattering effects. As the coupling level decreases, the radiation pattern of an excited array element, in the presence of the other array elements, approaches the pattern of the antenna element in isolation. The technique is first detailed for a two-element wideband monoconical antenna array and is then extended to a uniform 12-element circular array of the same monoconical antennas where only feedforward paths are applied to circumferentially adjacent elements to reduce the coupling over a very wide bandwidth. The experimental results indicate that the application of the proposed feedforward technique to a 12-element circular array of monoconical antennas can provide a minimum of 2-dB reduction in the average gain deviation from omnidirectional radiation over an about 30% fractional bandwidth. Another important feature of the feedforward technique is removal of radiation nulls of the array elements at all frequencies and all directions.",1558-2221,,10.1109/TAP.2016.2535101,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7419889,Antenna arrays;Feed-forward technique;Mutual coupling;Shadowing effect;Antenna arrays;feedforward technique;mutual coupling;shadowing effect,Antenna arrays;Antenna feeds;Couplings;Antenna radiation patterns;Broadband antennas;Mutual coupling,,24,,15,IEEE,25 Feb 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

There is no doubt that small cross section targets are hardly identified and determined. This problem demands the need for antenna pattern synthesizing with a high gain and highly reduced sidelobe level (SLL). In this paper, an optimization technique called self-adaptive differential evolution (SaDE) that can be able to learn and behave intelligently is integrated to determine an optimal set of excitation weights in the design of elliptical-cylindrical antenna array (ECAA). In this work, the SaDE-optimized hyper beam is proposed to achieve qualified radar performances. Nonuniform excitation amplitudes of the individual array elements of ECAA are performed to obtain reduced SLL, high directivity, and flexible radiation pattern which are crucial in radar applications. With increased antenna gain, small cross section objects can be accurately identified and determined even in volatile environment where there are different natures of interferences. Besides, the proposed work enables steering electronically and it allows scanning very rapidly across a wide range of elevation and azimuth planes. To evaluate the improved performance of the proposed optimization scheme, comparison is done with genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), biogeography-based optimization (BBO), and invasive weed optimization (IWO) against different parameters. In general, the proposed work of pattern synthesis has resulted in much better reduction in SLL and first null beamwidth (FNBW) than both the uniformly excited and thinned ECAA.

In this study, four different scenarios of TM-based reconfigurable coaperture antenna arrays are introduced. The aims are to make use of the common antenna elements for the coaperture and to share the RF switches needed in TM technique to form the reconfiguration. For the reconfigurable functionality, the retrodirective (RD) technique is involved, and for the reconfigurable band, the synthesized transmission line (STL) technology is involved. Four proposed arrays are single-band time-modulated retrodirective and self-null-steering array (i.e., single-band TM-RDNA), single-band time-modulated/retrodirective/time-modulated retrodirective array (i.e., single-band TM-RDA), dual-band TM-RDA, and triband TM-RDA. In the single-band TM-RDNA, a frequency offset, which is equal to the TM frequency, between two time-modulated phase conjugators is introduced to realize the array capable of RD and self-null steering simultaneously at retransmitted frequency.

The good agreement between the theoretical results and the existing experimental data confirms the validity of the proposed expressions. Furthermore, a linear monomial dispersion characteristic function, which argues not for the absolute frequency value, but the relative frequency displacement of a frequency point relative to the frequency of initial value, is introduced to replace the polynomial expansion of the unknown correlation part in strong fluctuation theory.

This novel structure contains several layers of randomly displaced metal patches and layers are spaced by a quarter wavelength. Specular reflection at normal incidence is suppressed by the phase cancellation technique. The reduction bandwidth is broadened by setting the layer surface area ratio based on binomial coefficients. Because the structure contains no absorbent material, metal surfaces are divided into small patches and displaced randomly to avoid reflection peaks beyond the boresight direction.

This paper extends the CC method to the more general case of beam wave scattering. Gaussian beams are assumed incident upon a deterministic metal rough surface. Scatter patterns based on the CC method are calculated and compared to scatter patterns determined by the method of moments solution of an electric field integral equation formulation of the scatter problem. It was shown that good agreement between these two solution methods is obtained for scatter surfaces for which the CC method is shown to satisfy conservation of power and an accuracy criterion.,1558-2221,,10.1109/TAP.2016.2537383,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7423717,Correction Current (CC) method;Gaussian beam scattering;rough surface scattering;Correction current (CC) method;Gaussian beam scattering;rough surface scattering,Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface waves;Scattering;Aperture antennas;Metals,,4,,13,IEEE,2 Mar 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The second-order perturbative solutions are summations of the Fourier transform pair products of the roughness profiles, and hence, the problem is initially reduced to two generic problems: one with just a single rough surface with two stratified media above and below it and another with two rough interfaces with three stratified media above, between, and below them. The former helps find the second-order contribution of an individual rough interface while the latter is intended to determine the interaction contribution of two arbitrary rough interfaces. In this paper, the second generic problem is solved using the small perturbation method (SPM) based on the extended boundary conditions (EBC). In this SPM formulation, the stratifications are easily accounted for using the generalized coefficients inserted in the dyadic Green's functions (DGFs). Then, the expressions are simplified to find the solution of the first generic problem which is a special case of the second one. Next, the explicit expressions of the generalized coefficients are introduced to the solutions. Subsequently, the interaction terms of the second and the self-term of the first generic problem are combined to find the desired second-order solution.

The models are floating intercept (FI), fixed reference (FR), and ITU-R M.2135 urban microcellular (UMi) line-of-sight (LOS) and Manhattan-grid non-LOS (NLOS) models. These models are parameterized based on channel sounding campaigns in three cities covering radio frequencies ranging from 0.8 to 60 GHz. Fitting the models with measured pathloss reveals that the models are usable to cover the considered frequency range. The FI and FR models are equally simple and robust, with a slight advantage of the FI model in accuracy because of the larger number of model parameters. The original M.2135 LOS model is based on a two-ray model that includes a break point (BP). The model is extended for a better fit with measurements by including new model parameters such as a pathloss offset and a BP scaling factor that represent local scattering conditions of surrounding environments. The new model parameters are found frequency dependent in many cases. The original M.2135 model is furthermore simplified in NLOS scenarios while maintaining the model accuracy. The model parameters are derived using maximum likelihood estimation, which also showed that the modified M.2135 model offers up to 50% better accuracy compared to the FI and FR models in terms of the employed log-likelihood function (LLF). The improvement in accuracy is particularly remarkable in NLOS scenarios. A full set of parameters is provided for the models, allowing a choice for any given requirements on accuracy and complexity.

The combined radiation from both the microstrip patch and the slots leads to a CP omnidirectional radiation pattern.
