We show that the accuracy of the installed far-field and surface current for the investigated weakly scattering platform depends strongly on the configurations associated with the equivalent antenna representation. The root-mean-square error for the installed far-field error varies between 4.4%-8.4% for the considered configurations of near-field equivalent representations installed on the investigated platform. When using FFSs, the design parameters have an even larger influence of the achieved accuracy. There is also a varying accuracy depending on the type of numerical method used. Based on the results, some recommendations on the choice of subdomain for the equivalent antenna representation are given associated with the platform. In industrial antenna applications, the accuracy in determining, e.g., installed far-fields and antenna isolation on large platforms is critical. Equivalent representations can reduce the fine-detail complexity of antennas and thus give an efficient numerical description to be used in large-scale simulations. The results, in this paper, highlight to antenna designers and system engineers the accuracy challenges associated with the use of equivalent antenna representations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2829806","Saab Surveillance; Vinnova; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8345632","Antenna modeling;computational electromagnetics (CEMs);EM analysis;EM modeling","Numerical models;Computational modeling;Geometry;Electromagnetics;Antenna radiation patterns;Magnetics","","10","","35","IEEE","24 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By utilizing the mutual coupling between elements, the radiation resistance of the antenna is significantly increased, leading to considerable gain enhancement and better matching performance. The composite antenna has the same height as the single monopole (λ0/150) but a larger lateral dimension (λ0/16). The performance of the proposed antenna is compared with that of a single monopole antenna. It is shown that the peak gain of the composite antenna is about 10 dB higher than that of the monopole antenna. The design is then modified for frequency tunability to achieve frequency agility and higher bandwidth for certain modulations like frequency hopping spread spectrum. The fractional bandwidth of the tunable antenna is 3.32%, and the gain is further improved at higher frequencies.

Nonuniform loadings of shorting pins are installed into the traditional EH1-mode microstrip line, which provide a unique discontinuity affecting the mutual intersection of the passband and stopband, thus generating a newly created stopband within the continuous EH1-mode fast-wave region. After broadening the stopband, the slope of normalized phase constant is remarkably raised up and the original wide bandwidth of the operating region is effectively reduced, resulting in a dramatically enhanced frequency sensitivity. An equivalent-circuit model of the proposed EH1-mode MLWA with nonuniform loading is built up at first, then its nonuniform loading discontinuity effect on dispersion transformation between passband and stopband is further explicated. Moreover, full-wave numerical extraction is also conducted to accurately demonstrate the modified phase constant under varied lateral pins' loading positions and strip widths. After thorough discussion, one set of optimized parameters are selected into antenna design.

This is partially because the antenna in capsule is directive or has nulls on its radiation pattern, which are difficult to avoid, especially for the electrically small capsule type of antennas. In this paper, a conformal capsule antenna with reconfigurable radiation pattern is proposed as a proof of concept to overcome this dilemma. By employing two MOSFETs, the proposed capsule antenna can operate under four states. The desired frequency range around 2.45 GHz is covered by all the four states, while the radiation pattern changes with the operating state; hence, an omnidirectional radiation pattern with no nulls can be synthesized. Besides, an additional impedance bandwidth in low gigahertz range occurs under two operating states. Given the various functions, the antenna maintains simple and compact and is conformal to the inner wall of the capsule shell. Operating mechanism of the proposed capsule antenna is discussed in detail, and prototypes are fabricated to validate the design.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2829828","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61372012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8345685","Capsule antenna;conformal;reconfigurable;robust communication","Dipole antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Substrates;MOSFET;Inductors;Directive antennas","","35","","26","IEEE","24 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The height of the L-band cavity is reduced by adopting an inverted-T configuration. Each of the crossed slots is fed by a pair of differential probes to ensure the correct modal excitation with high isolation. For evaluation, the X-band slot subarray is center fed by a coax probe although slot excitation is also possible. An initial prototype array comprising 4 × 3 L-band elements interleaved with X-band subarrays was fabricated to allow initial measurements.

The second one is how to minimize the notch level at a given region, on the premise of a permissible gain loss in mainlobe. To these ends, two nonconvex optimization problems are first formulated and then relaxed to their quasi-convex forms, by using the LFSDR technique. To further solve the resultant problems, the bisection method, which is commonly used in quasi-convex optimization, is adopted.

Each resonator is a circular aperture in a metallic screen that is strongly miniaturized by means of loading by a thin epsilon-negative and near-zero metamaterial (MTM) liner. Each MTM-lined aperture exhibits a fano-shape transmission profile, i.e., a peak followed by a minimum, and the resonance frequencies of different apertures are chosen such that the resonance of one lies within/very close to the antiresonance of the other to ensure strong decoupling. This paper shows that blocking an aperture using a conducting disc removes the corresponding resonance peak/minimum from the transmission/far-field amplitude spectrum, enabling far-field detection of any distribution of such obstacles with a spatial resolution determined by the aperture sizes, which measure less than one-sixth of free-space wavelength at their respective resonance frequencies.

A geometrical description in the frequency-wavenumber plane is developed to provide insight into the possible interactions and their nature. It is shown that the secular equation has a singularity, which results in a weak/passive second harmonic generation process. In addition, bandgaps arising from the strong/active parametric interaction between an incident wave and its space-time harmonic result in an inelastic Brillouinlike scattering process. Hence, when the incident frequency is inside a forward (backward) bandgap, a Stokes' (anti-Stokes') scattered wave bounces back to the source. Although the forward and backward bandgaps do not generally occur at the same frequency bands, the insertion loss and gap width are equal. Requirement that both gaps do not overlap enforces a lower bound on the modulation speed. It is shown that although an increase in the modulation index is desirable, as it enhances the nonreciprocal behavior, it also limits the range of possible modulation speeds. It is shown that an alternative way to enhance the nonreciprocity, whenever the modulation index is constrained, is through the reduction of the modulation wavelength. The effective complex refractive index is calculated over a wide frequency range. It is shown that peaks appear in the extinction coefficient, indicating scattering to Stokes' and anti-Stokes' waves. Finally, a comprehensive numerical analysis based on the finite-difference time-domain method is developed to verify and demonstrate the intriguing properties of space-time modulated media.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2835305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357525","Active circuits;dispersion;distributed parameter circuits;electromagnetic propagation;finite difference methods;metamaterials;microwave photonics;multiwave mixing;optical harmonic generation;periodic structures;time-varying systems","Harmonic analysis;Media;Scattering;Dispersion;Frequency modulation;Photonic band gap","","7","","31","IEEE","10 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The contact-region modeling (CRM) technique is introduced to conveniently model an arbitrary composite electromagnetic (EM) structure as a combination of relatively simple single region. The proposed generalized CM formulations eliminate many difficulties in previously published CM theories, where PEC bodies should be fully coated with dielectric layers or dielectric layers must be infinitely large in the 2-D plane. Specially, the CRM technique allows flexibly modeling arbitrarily combined metallic and dielectric regions using the electric-field integral equation (EFIE) and the PMCHWT equation, respectively. By enforcing field continuity conditions on various region interfaces, the EFIE-PMCHWT surface integral equation results in two generalized eigenvalue equations for characterizing the resonant behaviors of arbitrarily composite structures. It is demonstrated that the resultant eigenvalues indicate the ratio of the stored and radiated power of each CM. Moreover, the corresponding modal currents and modal fields clearly explain the underlying radiation or scattering mechanisms of EM problems. The numerical results for typical composite metallic-dielectric structures are presented to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed CM formulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2829843","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671127,61631006,61721001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8345574","Characteristic modes (CMs);composite metallic–dielectric structures;contact-region modeling (CRM);electric-field integral equation (EFIE)-PMCHWT;surface integral equation (SIE)","Dielectrics;Surface impedance;Customer relationship management;Integral equations;Modal analysis;Numerical models","","41","","33","IEEE","24 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The MoM weighted DDM is a triple-step iterative method applied to the SIE problem decomposed into subdomain problems. In the first step of each iteration, the subdomain problems are solved without mutual coupling taken into account. In the second step of each iteration, all subdomain solutions from the current and all previous iterations are linearly combined with weights that are determined by the MoM. In the third step of each iteration, the residual of the original SIE problem is found, which is to be used as the excitation in the next iteration. This novel approach features fast convergence and high compression rate of the initial set of bases, thus enabling solution of electrically large scatterers. The compact matrix representation enables easy implementation using a direct MoM solver as a numerical engine and easy parallelization. In the implementation of the method, additional acceleration is achieved using the concepts of active subdomains and far-field approximation.

In this paper, to account for effects of spatial dispersion on transmission of high-speed signals along graphene nanoribbon (GNR) interconnects, a discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) algorithm is proposed. The atomically thick GNR is modeled using a nonlocal transparent surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC) incorporated into the DGTD scheme. Since the conductivity is a complicated function of  $\mathbf {q}$  (and one cannot find an analytical Fourier transform pair between  $\mathbf {q}$  and spatial differential operators), an exact time-domain SIBC model cannot be derived. To overcome this problem, the conductivity is approximated by its Taylor series in spectral domain under low- $\mathbf {q}$  assumption. This approach permits expressing the time-domain SIBC in the form of a second-order partial differential equation (PDE) in current density and electric field intensity. To permit easy incorporation of this PDE with the DGTD algorithm, three auxiliary variables, which degenerate the second-order (temporal and spatial) differential operators to first-order ones, are introduced. Regarding to the temporal dispersion effects, the auxiliary differential equation method is utilized to eliminate the expensive temporal convolutions. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme, numerical results, which involve characterization of spatial dispersion effects on the transfer-impedance matrix of GNR interconnects, are presented.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2826567","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61701423); NSFC(grant numbers:61674105,61622106,61701424); UGC of Hong Kong(grant numbers:AoE/P-04/08); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8337768","Auxiliary differential equation (ADE) method;discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method;graphene nanoribbon (GNR);nonlocal conductivity;spatial dispersion;surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC)","Graphene;Conductivity;Time-domain analysis;Dispersion;Method of moments;Surface impedance;Impedance","","17","","32","IEEE","13 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The quality of these simulations relies on the accuracy of environmental description and electrical properties of constituent materials. This paper presents a novel method of on-site permittivity estimation. The method utilizes an accurate geometrical database of the environment for identifying flat and smooth surfaces producing reflections. The method exploits a limited number of on-site channel sounding to extract reflected multipaths and compare them with ray tracing based on the environmental database. The permittivity of the identified reflecting surfaces is estimated by solving an inverse reflection problem. The method was experimentally tested with limited radio channel measurements at 60 GHz in a large empty office room. The identified reflecting surfaces are classified according to their mean permittivity estimates, showing their consistency with physical material evidence and the permittivity database in the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Recommendation (ITU-R P.2040-1). The estimated permittivity values are visualized as a 3-D map, giving an intuitive understanding of materials constituting the environment.

The methodology is applied to a practical wearable textile patch antenna designed to cover the 2.4-2.5 GHz band and which is subject to five geometric and material random parameters. Specifically, the “Weierstrass” curves crumpling effect is modeled for the first time. Comparison to the full-wave simulations shows that the derived surrogate model predicts the FF with a good accuracy and with a speed up factor of 105.

By using the well-known (stationary cylinder) exact and asymptotic solutions, we obtain the scattered EM field in this frame. These fields are then mapped back to the incident-field frame of reference. This procedure yields the exact and asymptotic scattered EM fields.

The PCM has the advantage that its leading terms directly yield a solution in the simple ray format of the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD). On the other hand, it is commonly noted that it is not the leading term of the PCM but that of the VWM which remains valid for the case of complex waves. Nevertheless, it is shown here that the PCM can surprisingly work even for some special complex wave cases, only if certain conditions are met. Indeed, it is demonstrated here that the PCM meets these conditions for the special case of the diffraction of a complex source beam (CSB) by a wedge. Also, the PCM directly yields a UTD like solution for this case. The latter result is significant as it provides a strong justification for obtaining a simple UTD type solution for the more general problem of the diffraction of a CSB incident from an arbitrary direction on a wedge with arbitrary curvature, directly via analytic continuation of the corresponding UTD result available for a curved wedge illuminated by a point source in real space. It is also shown that the VWM solution can be trivially cast in the UTD format, by expressing it as a sum of the PCM solution plus a UTD slopelike correction term; a similar result was obtained previously using a higher order term from a generalization of the PCM procedure given elsewhere.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2826569","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8340052","Asymptotic technique;complex source beam (CSB);diffraction analysis;electromagnetic (EM) theory;geometrical theory of diffraction;numerical analysis;steepest decent method","Phase change materials;Diffraction;Antennas;Beams;Electromagnetics;Electromagnetic scattering","","5","","22","IEEE","17 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After the combiner, the harmonic components' characteristic of the combined signal is influenced by the DOA. Through analyzing their mathematical relationship, the DOA can be calculated out directly.

On the other hand, Q-/V-band Satcom systems suffer from highly variable propagation losses, which must be accurately assessed and modeled. The Alphasat Aldo Paraboni propagation experiment, conceived and realized by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), Rome, Italy, has been running since 2014 to carefully investigate the propagation effects in the Ka- and Q-band and, thus, to support the design of high-throughput systems and propagation impairment mitigation techniques. In the framework of this experiment, ASI deployed two large ground terminals (Cassegrain antenna with 4.2 m diameter) in Tito Scalo (South of Italy) and Spino d'Adda (North of Italy). This contribution investigates the effect of antenna strut elongation on propagation measurements, which causes an additional reduction of 1-2 dB in the received signal during sunny days.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2826652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8337763","Atmospheric propagation;propagation measurements;satellite antennas;satellite communications (Satcom)","Antenna measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Clouds;Temperature measurement;Antennas;Satellite broadcasting;Attenuation","","6","","14","IEEE","13 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The function of the anisotropic MS is to focus the incident plane waves around 10 and 14 GHz on spots with different focal lengths and spaces. To reduce the block effect of the reflection mode, an extra phase gradient is introduced to the initial phase distribution of the y-polarization to deflect the reflection mode main-beam to an angle of 30°.

In addition, the modal near-field distributions are proposed to discriminate the unwanted modes along with the modal admittance and eigencurrent distributions. Inductive loads are used to suppress the unwanted modes for mitigating the out-of-band mutual coupling while the in-band radiation property is mostly retained.

Our developed algorithm facilitates the adaptive refinement process utilizing dynamic coarse-level correction, exploits the hierarchical feature of the refined systems through p-type multigrid method in subdomains, then solves the lowest order system through algebraic multigrid method in auxiliary and node-based spaces. The numerical results show that with this effective coarse-level correction, the residual errors introduced by adaptive refined systems can be eliminated quickly by the DDM. Besides, optimal performance in terms of simulation time is achieved, regardless of workload imbalances during the adaptive steps. Several large-scale electromagnetic problems are analyzed for accuracy as well as performance evaluation of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2816680","NSFC(grant numbers:61431014); National Key Basis Research Development Program of China(grant numbers:2013CB328904); NSAF(grant numbers:U1530121); Science Challenge Project(grant numbers:JCKY2016212A502); Zhejiang Provincial NSFC of China(grant numbers:LQ14F010010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8318692","Domain decomposition method (DDM);finite-element method (FEM);multilevel method;p-adaptive refinement;parallel computing","Finite element analysis;Electromagnetics;Heuristic algorithms;Adaptive systems;Parallel processing;Antennas;Linear systems","","7","","16","IEEE","16 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A weaker admissibility condition in FEM is proposed for higher efficiency than the conventional one. A better reduction scheme is presented for electrodynamic scattering problem. Numerical experiments show that our developed ND H-LU-based FE direct solver has O(NlogN) memory complexity and O(Nlog2N) CPU time complexity for a quasi-static problem, but a larger and irregular complexity for an electrodynamic problem.

The proposed algorithm is based on the formulation of a modified cross correlation Green's function (CGF), which directly incorporates the specific angular distribution functions and cross-polarization discrimination parameters. Thus, the proposed technique based on modified CGF is able to calculate ECC/MEG for MIMO antennas in nonuniform propagation scenario, directly from the time-domain antenna currents. This avoids the troublesome determination of far-field antenna pattern at each working frequency and the consequent postprocessing, as required in the conventional approach. Numerical examples using thin-wire half-wavelength dipole antennas and printed microstrip-fed slot antennas are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique for characterizing MIMO antennas in nonuniform propagation environment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2829538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8345288","Cross correlation Green’s function (CGF);envelope correlation coefficient (ECC);finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method;mean effective gain (MEG);multiple input multiple output (MIMO);nonuniform propagation","MIMO communication;Dipole antennas;Time-domain analysis;Correlation;Finite difference methods;Current density","","17","","30","IEEE","23 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the surface equivalent principle, the original object can be decomposed into two independent domains, i.e., the exterior region (free space) and interior region (microstrip). Different from the traditional EFIE-PMCHWT method, in this new multiple-traces method, dielectric surface is discretized with two pairs of meshes, and Robin transmission conditions (TCs) are enforced on the interface between the exterior and interior regions to ensure the continuity of fields. In comparison with the traditional EFIE-PMCHWT, this new MT-PMCHWT has a better iteration convergence property. Additionally, a new multiple-traces electric field/combined field integral equation with better iteration convergence is also proposed. Because the continuity of fields is ensured by TCs, the exterior and interior regions can be discretized with nonconformal meshes, which improves the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed methods substantially.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2835159","National Excellent Youth Fund(grant numbers:NSFC 61425010,NSFC 61471001,NSFC 61701003); National Natural Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars(grant numbers:NSFC 61722101); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:NSFC 1808085QF183); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357532","Electromagnetic scattering;microstrip;multiple-traces;surface integral equation (SIE);transmission condition (TC)","Dielectrics;Microstrip;Integral equations;Transmission line matrix methods;Mathematical model;Surface impedance;Microstrip antennas","","10","","21","IEEE","10 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The forward-backward method (FBM) has been applied extensively for solving electromagnetic scattering from single-layer rough surfaces due to its rapid convergence rate. Nevertheless, the performance of the FBM deteriorates, as it is applied to layered random rough surface problems. The proposed method greatly improves the convergence rate of the FBM by applying a residual minimization step. The computational cost of the minimization step and the forward-backward sweeps is expedited by using the spectral acceleration. In this communication, the proposed algorithm is applied as a solution to the problem of electromagnetic wave scattering from layered rough surfaces. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the better convergence properties of the proposed method as compared with the standard FBM. In addition, the proposed method is shown to be more robust than the FBM, especially as the distance between interfaces decreases. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is also presented and discussed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2835525","Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)(grant numbers:102.01-2016.27); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357937","Forward–backward method (FBM);integral equation (IE);iterative method;method of moments (MoM);random rough surfaces;spectral acceleration (SA)","Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface impedance;Surface waves;Sea surface;Optical surface waves;Electromagnetic scattering","","4","","14","IEEE","11 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
