During the optimization process, adaptive statistical surrogate mappings between input variables and output objectives are formulated within a model selection framework. These statistical models can be evaluated in fractions of a second and serve as an efficient surrogate for a more computationally intensive process, such as an electromagnetic simulation. By exploiting the speed offered from surrogate modeling techniques, new, high-performance designs can be quickly identified. In addition, complete tolerance analysis can be conducted within the optimization loop, which provides designers with critical information regarding the robustness of designs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, it will be applied to the optimization of a capacitively loaded monopole and a wideband Vivaldi antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2870338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466860","Antennas;multiobjective;optimization methods;Pareto optimization;robust optimization;surrogate models;tolerance analysis","Computational modeling;Optimization;Robustness;Training;Antennas;Tolerance analysis;Analytical models","","118","","42","IEEE","16 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To radiate the K-band electromagnetic wave without blocking, the metasurfaces are discretized by the subcell of a square ring and an inner square patch to achieve a frequency selective function. Then, as an example, the microstrip-fed slot is used to drive the metasurfaces at the S-band, while an 8 × 8 substrate integrated waveguide slot array antenna between microstrip and metasurface is designed at the K-band.

This LPDA structure constitutes fewer dipole elements than a conventional LPDA antenna that exhibits similar resonant frequencies. In the design of a miniaturized LPDA antenna, various size-reduction techniques have been proposed in the open literature to decrease the lateral size of a conventional LPDA. However, little or no attention has been focused on reducing the size of the LPDA antenna by shortening the boom or axial length. In pursuit of reducing the total length of a conventional LPDA, a dual-band dipole antenna is proposed as the radiating elements for the LPDA antenna in this paper. The proposed dipole structure is a printed half-wave principal dipole loaded with a pair of resistive structures via subfeeding lines. A pair of resistive loads forms the auxiliary (secondary) dipole of the proposed dipole antenna. The structure of the proposed dual-band dipole is achieved without a ground plane as opposed to many existing dual-band antenna types. As a result, the dipole antenna has a simple geometry with omnidirectional characteristics. Also, the feeding structure of this dipole can provide an extra degree of freedom to tune the antenna for matching purposes. A 25-element LPDA antenna is designed with a much reduced boom length compared with existing LPDA structures. To confirm the feasibility of the technique, the experimental results of the proposed LPDA prototype were analyzed and juxtaposed with a benchmark LPDA.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2874710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486977","Boom length;dipole antenna;dual band;log-periodic dipole array (LPDA)","Dipole antennas;Dual band;Antenna arrays;Benchmark testing;Resonant frequency;Antenna feeds;Antenna radiation patterns","","43","","35","IEEE","9 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna must also have a low profile to meet drastic volume constraints and have efficiencies higher than 80% at both the uplink and downlink X-band deep space frequency bands. This antenna is a key component for this potential mission as it enables direct-to-earth links rather than relaying signals via a nearby spacecraft.

Then, the analysis and design of the LWA array are carried out. New formulas and conditions have been proposed for realizing uniform radiation distribution and maximum aperture efficiency. Five supporting beams are introduced to increase the antenna gain and power capacity. An LWA array as a prototype is fabricated and tested to verify the analysis and simulation. Experimental results agree well with the simulation. The return loss is better than 17 dB at the center frequency 9.7 GHz, the gain is 38.75 dB, and the corresponding aperture efficiency is 80.7%.

However, in comparison, surprisingly little research work has been devoted to the study of elliptical loop antennas, which provide designers with an additional degree of freedom to control their radiation properties. Here, a complete set of analytical expressions is derived for the vector potential and corresponding far-zone electromagnetic fields of a thin elliptical loop antenna of an arbitrary size based on a general Fourier cosine series representation of the current distribution. Furthermore, several important special cases of the general theory are considered including elliptical loop antennas with a constant and a cosinusoidal current distribution. It is also shown that for the special case when the lengths of the semimajor and semiminor axes are equivalent, the general expressions for the far-zone electromagnetic fields will reduce to well-known results for a circular loop.

The Butler matrix is implemented on a multilayer structure, using 90° hybrid couplers and 45° phase shifters. For the design of the coupler and phase shifter, we propose a unified methodology applied, but not limited, to elliptically shaped geometries. The multilayer realization enables us to avoid microstrip crossing and supports wideband operation of the beamforming network. To realize the Butler matrix, we introduce a step-by-step and stage-by-stage design methodology that enables accurate balance of the output weights at the antenna ports to achieve a stable beamforming performance. In this paper, we use a Vivaldi antenna element in a linear four-element array, since such element supports wideband and wide-scan angle operation. A soft condition in the form of corrugations is implemented around the periphery of the array, in order to reduce the edge effects. This technique improved the gain, the sidelobes, and helped to obtain back radiation suppression. Finally, impedance loading was also utilized in the two edge elements of the array to improve the active impedance.

To achieve a wideband high-gain reflectarray antenna, a design method is proposed based on the spatial dispersion compensation concept. By introducing different resonant structures in reflectarray elements, each element has the ability to track the desired frequency-phase response, which means that the spatial dispersion of the large-aperture reflectarray antenna can be compensated by the phase dispersion of the reflectarray element over the entire frequency band. Thus, a wideband highgain reflectarray antenna can be realized by the use of singlelayer elements. As an example, a center-fed reflectarray antenna with a diameter of 354 mm (35.4λ0 at 30 GHz) and a focal length to diameter ratio of 0.97 is designed and fabricated. The measured maximum gain of the prototype reflectarray antenna is 37.8 dBi with a 1 dB bandwidth of 26.7%, i.e., from 26.5 to 34.5 GHz.

The array has a seven-element hexagonal configuration, consisting of dual-mode circular microstrip antennas. It is shown that for small scan angles up to 8°, a tapered amplitude distribution reduces the grating lobes to below -30 dB, when only the dominant mode is excited in the antenna element. As for wider scan angles up to 45°, an additional higher order mode needs to be excited as well to reduce the grating lobes down to -30 dB for the large element spacing of one wavelength. The proposed method also proves to be effective for wider scan angles up to 60° for element spacing of three quarters of a wavelength. This approach leads to the realization of thinned arrays with less number of elements, in which the weighting functions and mode excitation of the elements can be controlled by an adaptive signal processing unit in scanning phased array antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2874717","Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems(grant numbers:ECCS-1653915); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8487000","Element spacing;grating lobes;higher order modes;microstrip patch;phased arrays","Phased arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Gratings;Microstrip antennas;Microstrip antenna arrays;Microstrip","","42","","23","IEEE","9 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By forming an array of closely spaced unit elements, a high directivity can be achieved. Despite the high directivity, these arrays suffer from narrow bandwidth and low efficiency. In this paper, we present an approach to enhance the bandwidth of superdirective arrays using the network characteristic modes. The key step is to use an internally loaded compact wideband unit element. The loads inside the unit element are used to manipulate the characteristic modes in order to optimize its impedance bandwidth. A two-element endfire array is then formed. The modal coefficients of the characteristic fields are then optimized at multiple frequency points in order to radiate a maximal directivity in the endfire direction. The best current excitation that can maintain a constant directivity as a function of frequency is then deduced. Finally, a feeding network that can provide the desired excitation at the array ports is designed and integrated on the array system, where the 1 dB directivity bandwidth is about 23% with Dmax = 7.1 dBi.

In particular, two different strategies are developed for GAMs based on either graded refractive index (GAMR) or graded filling factor (GAMF). In both strategies, the inverse scattering problem is solved by a proper reformulation of the contrast source inversion method, wherein a proper rescaling of the amplitude of the primary sources is also used. In particular, in the first strategy, the GAMF is obtained by exploiting homogenization theories. In the second strategy, the GAMR is synthesized by exploiting a suitable representation basis for the unknown contrast function, and then simple analytical formulas are used to determine the corresponding GAMF.

Interactions between multiple local waves produced by the basic metaparticles at multiple frequencies sampled in a superwide frequency band are manipulated and optimized simultaneously to achieve phase cancellation. The proposed metasurface can achieve a 10 dB RCS reduction in a superwide frequency band from 5.5 to 32.3 GHz with a ratio bandwidth (fH/fL of 5.87:1 under normal incidence for both polarizations. Furthermore, the RCS reduction is larger than 8 dB from 5.4 to 40 GHz with a ratio bandwidth of 7.4:1. The metasurface also has a good performance under wide-angle oblique incidences.

By comprehensively engineering the weak and strong dispersion regimes of the SSPPs structure, the cutoff frequency of SSPPs can be made close to the upper operating frequency of the feeding monopole. In this way, the SSPPs structure serves as a high-efficiency radiator in the operating band and as a broadband absorber out of band, leading to low RCS out of band. As an example, a C-band antenna with low RCS in the X-band was designed, simulated, and measured. Both the simulation and experiment results show that the antenna can radiate in the C-band, with average gain 6 dB and fractional bandwidth 28%. In order to evaluate the RCS reduction performances, a  $5\times 5$  antenna array was fabricated and the mono-static RCS was measured. The measured results show that the mono-static RCS is reduced by more than 10 dB in the whole X-band (8.0–12.5 GHz), with a maximal reduction above 30 dB.

Specifically, in satellite communications, the trend is also to move to higher frequencies and integrate the receiving and transmitting antennas in one dual-band terminal. However, these simultaneous demands make the design and fabrication of the composing parts very challenging. We propose, here, a dual-band dual-linear polarization (LP)-to-CP converter that works in the transmission mode. The working principle of this polarizer is explained through an example for Ka-band satellite communications at 19.7-20.2 and 29.5-30 GHz. The LP-to-CP converter is a single panel composed of identical unit cells with a thickness of only 1.05 mm and a size of 5.3 mm × 5.3 mm. Due to its operation in the transmission mode, the polarizer can be combined with a simple dual-band dual-LP antenna to obtain the desired dual-band dual-CP single antenna. However, the unique property of this polarizer is yet the fact that it converts a given LP wave, e.g., x-polarization, to orthogonal CP waves at the two nonadjacent frequency bands, e.g., left-handed CP at lower band and right-handed CP at higher band. The polarizer is tested both with 20 and 30 GHz LP rectangular horns to illuminate a dual-band transmit array (TA) to obtain wide-angle steering of CP beams. The performance of the polarizer and its association with the TA is evaluated through simulation and measurements. We also present design guidelines for this type of polarizer.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2874680","European Space Agency(grant numbers:4000109111/13/NL/AD); Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia(grant numbers:PEstOE/EEI/LA/0008/2013,UID/EEA/50008/2013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486985","Antenna–filter–antenna;circular polarization (CP);dual-band antennas;frequency selective surfaces;periodic structures;polarization conversion","Dual band;Polarization;Satellite communication;Satellite antennas;Antenna feeds","","223","","32","IEEE","9 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a dissipation theory for 3-D FDTD inspired by the principle of energy conservation. We view the FDTD update equations for a 3-D region as a dynamical system and show under which conditions the system is dissipative. By requiring each component of an FDTD-like scheme to be dissipative, the stability of the overall coupled scheme follows by construction. The proposed framework enables the creation of provably stable schemes in an easy and modular fashion, since conditions are imposed on the individual components rather than on the overall coupled scheme as in existing approaches.

A comparison between the measurement data performed both in the vehicle and in the configured test facility is presented. This comparison shows a good agreement between these two sets of measurements. It demonstrates that different static wireless in-vehicle multipath channels, corresponding to various transmitting and receiving antenna configurations, can be reproduced inside the proposed prototype test facility.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2873403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8478834","Conductive liquid;reverberation chamber;root-mean-square (rms) delay spread;vehicle;wireless multipath channel","Wireless communication;Antenna measurements;Test facilities;Delays;Multipath channels;Receiving antennas","","","","17","IEEE","2 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use canonical objects, i.e., cylinders, for tests and evaluate measurement errors and system performance by comparisons with the theoretical scattered field, which has an analytical expression. For the sake of generality, we work with both vertical-vertical and horizontal-horizontal polarizations. We propose a complete workflow that performs noise suppression and positioning error correction, relying on two quantities: 1) the cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter and 2) the predetermination of the position of the device under test (DUT). The originality of our approach is that both quantities are fully defined by the measurement data without apriori knowledge of the DUT. Since different steps of the workflow are generic, it can easily be transposed to any scattering measurement system. Finally, once corrected, measurements at 75, 95, and 110 GHz exhibit signal-to-noise ratios of close to 15 dB for dielectric cylinders and up to 25 dB for metallic ones.

In this case, the electromagnetic field can be described by an integral equation using the Stratton-Chu formula. The solution of this equation is sought in the form of a multipole expansion at large distances from the object and in the form of an expansion in the small parameter k in the vicinity of the object. The coefficients in these expansions are determined by solving a recurrence system of electrostatic problems. To illustrate the approach, we consider diffraction of the electromagnetic wave on a cylinder whose cross section consists of two eccentric circles. The proposed scheme for solving diffraction problems is quite simple and does not impose any restrictions on the dielectric and magnetic permeability of the layers.

Computations show that the phase stability in the multiple-mode zone is much poorer than that in the single-mode zone, and the phase standard deviations evaluated considering the ionospheric anisotropy are more consistent with the measured data. It is also found that there exist pronounced directional differences in the interference distributions, and the effect of MMI is weakened as the geomagnetic inclination angle increases. By comparison of the phase standard deviation and the field strength, we find that the maxima of the phase standard deviation coincide with the minima of the field strength.

In addition, the entire system can be arbitrarily moved along the target performing microwave and depth camera synchronized acquisitions from different views with a twofold purpose, namely: 1) enabling a coverage area much larger than that possible with a static imaging system and b) allowing for incorporation of several tilt angles (or views) to enhance capturing specular reflection imaging data to improve the overall image quality.

This paper introduces a framework of the deep neural network to address the DOA estimation problem, so as to obtain good adaptation to array imperfections and enhanced generalization to unseen scenarios. The framework consists of a multitask autoencoder and a series of parallel multilayer classifiers. The autoencoder acts like a group of spatial filters, it decomposes the input into multiple components in different spatial subregions. These components thus have more concentrated distributions than the original input, which helps to reduce the burden of generalization for subsequent DOA estimation classifiers. The classifiers follow a one-versus-all classification guideline to determine if there are signal components near preseted directional grids, and the classification results are concatenated to reconstruct a spatial spectrum and estimate signal directions.

Switching functionality is achieved by a selectively metallized plate (SMP) repositionable within a microfluidic channel that is brought in close proximity to the microstrip line feed network of an FPA. The feed network is strategically designed to exhibit gap discontinuities that are sequentially overlapped by the SMP metallizations. The capacitive couplings between the SMP metallizations and the gap discontinuities are designed to achieve wideband (~20 GHz) switching functionality with low insertion loss (IL . 0.2 dB). Transmission line theory is utilized to demonstrate that the feed network offers 38% fractional bandwidth with ≤7 dB IL for linear arrays of 32 elements. This performance constitutes a significant improvement over the recently reported resonant feed network based realization of microfluidic beam-steering FPAs (MFPAs). Experimental verification is carried out through the design and fabrication of a 30 GHz eight-element FPA. The FPA exhibits measured gains ranging between 20.2 and 22.6 dBi. Loss budget breakdown confirms the low-loss performance of the microfluidically switched feed networks (≤3 dB). The required microfluidic actuation range is 4.2 mm and 10× lower than that of the prior work. This allows to achieve a faster beam-steering speed (0.27 s versus 5.25 s of previous designs).

Because CMA provides modes that incorporate a mutual coupling effect, CMA can be used to develop a method for compensating this mutual coupling effect. An understanding of the symmetries and underlying physical characteristics of the characteristic modes (CMs) of a receive-mode antenna can be used to intuitively explain the effects of incident signal polarization and incidence angle on the port signal. Using this knowledge, a mutual coupling compensation matrix (MCCM) is constructed by finding the CMs and Z-matrix of a metallic antenna array through a single simulation. The proposed method is validated by comparing MCCM-predicted with simulated port currents on a 1-D linear bowtie antenna array model. Further validation revealed that the proposed MCCM significantly reduced the compensation error and outperformed the commonly used open-circuit voltage-based MCCM in providing accurate direction-of-arrival estimation results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2869431","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:No.2016-0-00130); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8458203","Characteristic mode analysis (CMA);mutual coupling compensation;receive-mode antenna array","Antenna arrays;Receiving antennas;Mutual coupling;Short-circuit currents;Transmitting antennas;Current distribution","","10","","21","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, the problem is solved by uniting the method of moments (MoM) in the space domain and a marching-on-in-time (MOT) scheme in the time domain. The MoM requires structured conforming meshes for discretizing geometries because of the used divergence-conforming Rao-Wilton-Glisson and Schaubert-Wilton-Glisson basis functions and the implementation will be more inconvenient when incorporated with the MOT scheme that has a well-known late-time instability problem. In this communication, we propose a different scheme to solve the problem and it uses a Nyström method to discretize the space domain and Galerkin's method with Laguerre basis and testing functions to discretize the time domain. The Nyström method has several merits compared to the MoM while Galerkin's method can result in an unconditional stability in the time domain.

Brekhovskikh put forward an approximate solution, so-called the tangent-plane approximation (TPA), which is also referred to as the Kirchhoff approximation. In the TPA at each point of a smooth surface, the latter is approximated by a tangent plane at the point. Since in the case of reflection from a plane, the total field can be readily calculated by Fresnel-type formulas, the scattering problem acquires, in this case, an explicit, approximate solution. A natural generalization of the TPA in 2-D follows when the scattering surface at each point is approximated by a tangent cylinder [a tangent-cylinder approximation (TCA)]. The TCA is considered, in this communication, in the simplest case of convex surfaces, a scalar field, and an impedance boundary condition in 2-D. It is demonstrated that the TCA possesses significantly better accuracy and provides better treatment of the shadowing associated with scattering from rough surfaces being only slightly more demanding than TPA computationally.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2872739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8478154","Electromagnetic diffraction;electromagnetic radiation;electromagnetic scattering by rough surfaces","Surface impedance;Scattering;Surface waves;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface treatment;Boundary conditions","","2","","8","USGov","30 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we show that a circular antenna array can be made to project orthogonal data streams on orthogonal spatial beams and, through this process, create a temporal and spatial interference pattern that can be used for target location. This is demonstrated by the way of simulation of a two-beam 16-element circular antenna array carrying quadrature phase shift keying data.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2869257","Queens’s University of Belfast Studentship; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/N020391/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457258","Circular array;directional modulation (DM);phase shift keying;physical-layer secure communication","Antenna arrays;Phase shift keying;Azimuth;Receivers;Arrays;Directive antennas","","8","","9","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
