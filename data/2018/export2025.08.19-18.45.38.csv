The polarizer consists of two orthogonal apertures. The apertures transform the linear polarization of the dominant mode of the RWG antenna to CP. Each of these apertures is loaded by a p-i-n diode to alter its electrical length. This length difference provides the phase rotation needed to obtain CP. The signal polarization of the antenna can be selected by changing the applied bias voltage of p-i-n diodes as right-handed (RH)/left-handed (LH) CP. We can also achieve linear polarization if both diodes are ON or OFF. The reconfigurable polarizer acts as a bandpass filter, since the apertures can be considered as complementary electrically small resonators. This self-filtering capability is useful for reduction out of band noise in a communication system such as satellite links. The proposed antenna is designed to operate at 2.65 GHz, but the same approach can be applied to other frequency bands. The measurement results show a very good RH/LHCP and they are in good agreement with simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2767634","U.S. National Science Foundation CAREER Award(grant numbers:1620902); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8089435","Circular polarization (CP);filtenna;linear polarization;p-i-n diode;polarizer;reconfigurable polarization antenna;rectangular waveguide (RWG);satellite communication","Polarization;Antennas;Shape;P-i-n diodes;Resonant frequency;Antenna measurements;Radio frequency","","37","","31","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The metallic plates are vertically added on the ground plane in a sequential rotation way, surrounding the primary radiator of the crossed-dipole antenna. Owing to the coupling with the radiator, orthogonal currents can be induced on the metallic plates. Additional impedance and axial ratio passbands can, therefore, be generated beside the original operating band, enhancing its bandwidth substantially. As the metallic plates are mounted on the ground plane, no extra footprint is needed, making the area of the wideband antenna very compact. Simulation and measured results show that by using this simple structure, the operating bandwidth of CP crossed-dipole antenna can be enhanced significantly from ~30% to 106.1%.

Conductive fabric is used to form the conducting parts of the antenna on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate.

As a concept demonstration, a new frequency-reconfigurable antenna has been designed and fabricated. The details of the prototype manufacturing process are described. Two UWB human muscle equivalent phantoms were also fabricated for testing purposes. Furthermore, the antenna was subjected to several investigations on its RF performance (both in free space and on a flat phantom) and mechanical stability. The latter includes bending tests on several locations on a human-body shaped phantom and washing in a household washing machine. Good agreement between predicted and experimental results (both in free space and on the phantom) is observed, validating the proposed concept. The tests demonstrated that lumped components and other antenna parts remained intact and in working order even under extreme bending (to a bending radius of 28 mm) and after washing, thus maintaining the overall antenna performance including good frequency reconfigurability from 2.3 to 2.68 GHz.

Based on a Saleh-Valenzuela channel model, closed-form expressions of the 3-D spatial correlation (SC) for wide, narrow, and Von Mises power elevation spectra (PESs) are analytically derived. The effects of the PES on the convergence to massive multiple-input-multiple-output properties are then illustrated by defining and deriving a diagonal dominance metric. Numerically, the effects of antenna element mutual coupling (MC) are shown on the effective SC, eigenvalue structure, and mmWave user rate for different antenna topologies. It is concluded that although MC can significantly reduce SC for side-by-side dipole antenna elements, the change in antenna effective gain (and, therefore, signal-to-noise ratio) caused by MC becomes a dominating effect and ultimately determines the antenna array performance. The user rate of an mmWave system with hybrid beamforming, using an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm, is then shown for different antenna topologies with dipole and cross-polarized (x-pol) antenna elements. It is seen that even for small numbers of radio frequency chains, the OMP algorithm works well relative to the fully digital case for channels with high SC, such as the x-pol antenna array.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2759842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8058474","Correlation;millimeter wave propagation;MIMO systems;mutual coupling","Antenna arrays;Dipole antennas;Channel models;Topology;MIMO;Three-dimensional displays","","22","","59","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the phase gradient of the PGM is contrary to the wave vector of SSPPs, the dispersion curve of SSPPs can be translated into the fast wave zone, leading to frequency scanning radiation. As an example, we demonstrate a frequency scanning antenna operating at 8.8-10.7 GHz. A prototype was designed, fabricated, and measured.

First, an array of arrow-shaped elements backed by a strip grating is investigated. When the polarization of the incidence field is parallel to the orientation of the strip grating, the reflected and transmitted waves with approximately equal amplitude will be generated and there is a constant phase difference between them when the element dimensions are varied. Proved by the simulation and measured results, the metasurface based on the proposed element can simultaneously deflect the transmitted and reflected wavefronts but only by the same angle. Second, independent control of both amplitudes and phases of the transmitting and reflecting waves is achieved by cascading four metallic layers in order, i.e., a y-oriented strip layer, a y-directed grating layer, the arrow-shaped element, and an x-directed grating, with respect to different polarizations of the incident field. The simulation and measured results show that the y-polarized incident waves can be reflected by the four-layered metasurface into a designed reflection angle, while the x-polarized incident waves can be focused on the other side of the metasurface in a transmitting manner. Compared with the reported THz metasurfaces, the proposed elements can provide more advanced wavefront-control ability and they also feature the advantages of compact size, low cost, and lightweight. Therefore, the proposed metasurfaces can be applied as beam splitters for low-cost and compact THz imaging and detection systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2772021","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Project(grant numbers:61622104); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong General Research Fund(grant numbers:CityU 11250216); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8103003","Beam splitter (BS);metasurface;polarization;terahertz (THz);wavefront control","Reflection;Gratings;Strips;Substrates;Reflection coefficient;Antennas;Radar imaging","","48","","17","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the domain decomposition technique, the proposed coupling algorithm divides the computational domain into two regions, that is, the physical and PML regions, whose meshes can be nonconformal with each other. Instead of introducing time convolution terms, the new coupling scheme is implemented through employing different DGTD frameworks for the two regions. Specifically, the physical region employs the wave equation-based DGTD framework, while the PML region employs the first-order Maxwell's curl equations-based DGTD framework. To facilitate modeling of electrically small problems, the implicit Newmark-beta time integration is used for the physical region. To conveniently couple with the physical region, the implicit Crank-Nicolson algorithm is used for the PML region.

This scheme consists in placing the metasurface at virtual nodal plane introduced between the regular nodes of the staggered Yee grid and inserting fields determined by GSTCs in this plane in the standard FDTD algorithm. The resulting update equations are an elegant generalization of the standard FDTD equations. Indeed, in the limiting case of a null surface susceptibility (χsurf = 0), they reduce to the latter, while in the next limiting case of a time-invariant metasurface [χsurf ≠ χsurf(t)], they split in two terms, one corresponding to the standard equations for a one-cell (Δx) thick slab with diluted volume susceptibility (χ = χsurf/(2Δx)), and the other one reducing that slab to a quasi-zero-thickness mesh-less sheet. The proposed scheme is fully numerical and very easy to implement. Although it is explicitly derived for a monoisotropic metasurface, it may be straightforwardly extended to the bianisotropic case. Except for some particular cases, it is not applicable to dispersive metasurfaces, for which an efficient auxiliary different equation extension of the scheme is currently being developed by the authors.

By mapping the permittivity variation onto the parameters of the equivalent Lorentzian electric and magnetic susceptibility densities, χee and χmm, the problem is formulated into a set of second-order differential equations in time with nonconstant coefficients. The resulting field solutions are then conveniently solved using an explicit finite-difference technique and integrated with a Yee-cellbased propagation region to visualize the scattered fields taking into account the various diffractive effects from the metasurface of finite size. Several examples are shown for both linear and space-time varying metasurfaces which are excited with normally incident plane and Gaussian beams, showing detailed scattering field solutions.

The integral equation is first built in the entire volumetric domain, and then the entire volumetric domain is partitioned into some nonoverlapping geometric subdomains. The SWG basis functions are used to expand the equivalent electric flux density in the entire domain. Then, several concepts such as basic subdomain, extended region, and complementary region are introduced. The subproblem in an extended region is quickly solved by using the FFT-based method with DILU preconditioner, and the action of the complementary region of an extended region on this extended region itself is quickly calculated by means of FFT. In this scheme, FFT acceleration is achieved by fitting Green's function (FG) onto the nodes of one or more nested uniform Cartesian grid.

The proposed method combines the small perturbation method (SPM) and the Mie solution by using the expansion of plane waves in terms of vector spherical functions (VSFs) and vice versa. First, using SPM, the zeroth- and the first-order perturbative scattered fields of a rough interface for illuminations from above and below are derived. Using these solutions, the field transmitted to the lower half-space is determined as a spectrum of down-going plane waves. The scattered fields from the sphere are then calculated using the vector Mie solution. Subsequently, the VSFs are expanded in terms of up-going plane waves. These plane waves illuminate the interface, and using SPM, the scattered fields in the upper and lower regions are determined as infinite summations of plane waves. The reflected plane waves are once again scattered by the sphere and the scenario repeats. By inspecting the form of the fields resulting from the few first interactions of the sphere and the rough interface, a recursive form is obtained for the scattered fields. This recursive form is then used to rewrite the system of equations in a form containing all interactions in a single-step formulation. Accordingly, the zeroth- and the first-order closed-form scattered fields are obtained. The derived expressions are analytically and numerically validated. Finally, the numerical results for the case of the rough interface with sinusoidal profile are presented and briefly discussed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2772038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8103029","Buried objects;electromagnetic scattering;rough surfaces;small perturbation method (SPM);vector spherical functions (VSFs)","Scattering;Dielectrics;Two dimensional displays;Three-dimensional displays;Perturbation methods;Spectral analysis;Antennas","","15","","37","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the incoherent factors are estimated and the multiple subbands are compensated to be mutually coherent. Then, coherent subbands are fit by the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) model, where model parameters are estimated in the frame of sparse reconstruction. Different probability distribution functions are used to describe different noise environments, and the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate of scattering model parameters is achieved. It is shown that the MAP estimate can be obtained by iteratively solving a support vector regression problem.

Superdirective antennas are commonly considered as transmitters, but thinking of the antenna as a receiver may help to understand and overcome some of these limits on practical superdirectivity. We directly model a superdirective antenna in receive mode by calculating streamlines of Poynting vector held near the receiving antennas. Superdirectivity is achieved by expanding the shape of the effective area beyond the antenna physical aperture area. The degree of superdirectivity is parameterized by an effective area expansion distance. The theory predicts that superdirectivity is practical for electrically small and middle size antennas and electrically large antennas with a large aspect ratio. With this motivation, a 1.5λ×2λ superdirective horn antenna with resonant screen structure in front of the antenna aperture is designed and fabricated. The superdirective horn achieves a measured antenna efficiency of 115% over a reasonable bandwidth and with moderate sensitivity to fabrication errors.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2772929","National Science Foundation Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation(grant numbers:1309832); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8105820","Effective area shape;horn antennas;Poynting streamlines;superdirectivity","Aperture antennas;Shape;Horn antennas;Receiving antennas;Dipole antennas","","15","","20","IEEE","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The appropriate constraints within and on the boundaries of elements are provided. In particular, the handling of faces where quantities are discontinuous is discussed. The resulting bases are numerically characterized in terms of error convergence and system conditioning for a moment method discretization of the electric field volume integral equation for dielectric scatterers. Results show the accuracy of the proposed method as well as the low system matrix condition number that can be maintained as the basis order and mesh discretization are increased.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2775288","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2270); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115191","Basis functions;constrained bases;method of moments (MoM);volume integral equations","Dielectrics;Method of moments;Integral equations;Mathematical model;Scattering;Antennas;Convergence","","2","","13","IEEE","20 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose is to determine their contribution to the total field, inside and outside the dielectric body and under two possible excitations: incident plane wave or electric line source within the cylinder. The study has been done analytically to provide necessary physical insight of the results obtained. New details about the so-called nonphysical modes are provided. It is found that these modes, that can be neglected outside the dielectric body, do have a significant contribution to the inner field when the excitation source is within the dielectric body. It is concluded that the terms physical and nonphysical characteristic modes should be replaced for radiating and nonradiating characteristic modes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2768581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093642","Characteristic modes;dielectric cylinders;nonphysical modes;Poggio–Miller–Chang–Harrington–Wu–Tsai (PMCHWT) formulation","Dielectrics;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Mathematical model;Current distribution;Antennas;Method of moments;Geometry","","4","","18","IEEE","1 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The two-dimension Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived for a conformal antenna array by using the active directive radiation patterns of the array elements and compared with the isotropic ones. Moreover, the MUSIC method is used to confirm the CRLB results. Without loss of generality, the CRLB of a truncated hexagonal pyramid conformal array with seven patches is investigated which verify the significant effect of the directive elements in the DOA estimation accuracy rather than that of the isotropic ones. The simulation results prove that this conformal array achieves better DOA estimation performance rather than that of the planar array antenna especially at the horizon angles. Moreover, the conformal antenna array tilt angle is studied to achieve the optimum conformal array structure which depicts a tradeoff between the DOA estimation accuracy at low and high θ incident angles.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2772085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8103041","Conformal array;direction of arrival (DOA);patch","Antenna arrays;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Directive antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Estimation;Array signal processing;Patch antennas","","38","","15","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
