"On the Radiation Characteristics of Full-Loop, Half-Loop, and Quasi-Half-Loop Bond Wire Antennas","I. Ndip; K. -D. Lang; H. Reichl; H.

We commence with rigorous formulations and derivations of analytical models for calculating the vector potential, radiated electromagnetic fields, and directivity of full-loop BWAs (FL-BWAs), considering nonconstant current distribution along the BWAs. Based on the image theory, we derive an analytical model for calculating the directivity of half-loop BWAs (HL-BWAs) from that of FL-BWAs. Very good correlation is obtained between the directivities calculated analytically using the derived models, and numerically using commercial full-wave solvers, thus validating our analytical approach. We apply the verified models to thoroughly analyze the radiation characteristics of FL-BWAs and HL-BWAs. The radiation characteristics of an HL-BWA are based on the assumption that its reference plane is infinitely large and perfectly conducting. However, for the development of wireless systems, reference planes of finite sizes are required. Therefore, we investigate the impact of realistic planes sizes. Our results reveal that the radiation characteristics of BWAs referred to as “HL-BWAs” in published literature differ significantly from those of true HL-BWAs. Therefore, we introduce the term “quasi-half-loop BWA (QHL-BWA)” to describe BWAs with small reference planes. For experimental verification, QHL-BWAs which operate in the 60 GHz band were fabricated using the wedge-wedge bonding process. Both S-parameter and radiation pattern measurements were performed. Very good correlation was obtained between measurement and simulation results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2864319","Fraunhofer Society Funding Program DISCOVER(grant numbers:827061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8429514","Bessel functions;bond wire antenna (BWA);directivity;electromagnetic fields;full-loop (FL);gain;green’s function;half-loop (HL);image theory;millimeter wave (mmWave);quasi-half-loop (QHL);radiated power;radiation characteristic;radiation vector;vector potential","Analytical models;Wires;Shape;Electric potential;Antenna radiation patterns;Mathematical model","","9","","75","IEEE","8 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These are the major limiting factors for ESAs used in transmit applications, especially at high-frequency (HF) and lower Very HF frequency bands. This paper discusses the challenges of transmit ESA matching circuit design and the design process of a new non-Foster transmit matching architecture for electrically small monopole antennas that achieves wide bandwidth, high transmission efficiency (transducer power gain), and stability at the same time. The proposed circuit is composed of a current buffer (for high isolation), a transformer (for real-part matching), and a negative impedance converter (for imaginary-part matching). The measured −6 dB (−10 dB)  $|S_{11}|$  fractional bandwidth of the proposed non-Foster transmitting system is 110% (39%), while the maximum bandwidth that can be achieved is 0.076% (0.047%) when matched with the conventional passive matching. The transmission efficiency of the system is improved by as much as 34.4 dB compared to the same antenna without the proposed non-Foster matching circuit, and it retains an enhanced efficiency over the entire frequency band of operation (26–89 MHz). The system remains stable within this frequency band. The measurement results of the compact and broadband transmitting antenna prototype verify the design concept.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2863123","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2207,N00014-16-1-2098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425020","Electrically small antennas (ESAs);impedance matching;non-Foster circuits","Transmitting antennas;Bandwidth;Impedance;Gain;Transducers;RLC circuits","","32","","20","IEEE","3 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna is designed on the capsule shell, with two orthogonal counterparts to generate dual-polarized radiation. This design exhibits broad impedance bandwidths of 271 and 247 MHz for each port, covering the entire Medical Device Radiocommunications Service band as well as the 433.05-434.79 MHz Industrial Scientific Medical band. Due to the highly orthogonal current distributions of the proposed structure, an isolation of higher than 33 dB is achieved among the operating frequency bands in measurement. The dual-polarized antenna also shows an omnidirectional radiation property and a low cross-polarization level of around -40 dB, which helps to enhance communication quality, regardless of position and orientation. Whether other electronics and biocompatible coatings are included or an electromagnetic interference shielding is considered, the antenna still presents a robust performance. The cubic tissue phantom model is utilized for the initial design and optimization of the antenna structure. Moreover, the CST voxel human model is applied to study the conformal antenna in a realistic environment. Measurements are implemented using a solid tissue-mimicking phantom, and performances consistent with theoretical predictions are achieved.

The quasi-planar OMT with good isolation is based on the substrate-integrated waveguide technology, and it can be co-planar integrated with other mmW planar circuits seamlessly. A planar lens is designed on a quad-layered substrate and it has the priority of polarization selective that only takes effect on the horizontal polarization (H-pol). Consequently, high gain with the narrow beam in H-pol and low gain with wide beam in vertical polarization (V-pol) are achieved. To verify the idea, the proposed antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured, achieving a high gain of 26.4 dBi in H-pol, and a wide beamwidth in V-pol.

The operation of gap waveguide technology is based on the use of metallic pins that act as an artificial magnetic conductor, so the electromagnetic fields are confined and guided in the desired directions. To control a leaky-wave radiation of these confined fields is possible by tailoring the height of the pins, its periodicity, and the waveguide width. This radiation, as in any conventional LWA, is dispersive, leading to beam squint as the frequency is varied. Here, we mitigate this beam squint by using a prism made of dispersive pins and choosing appropriately their periodicity and height. With this prism, the leaky-wave radiation is focused into one single direction in a wide frequency band. This concept is demonstrated with a prototype designed to radiate at φ = 41° with a central frequency of 12 GHz and the high gain of 16.5 dBi. A 22% frequency bandwidth for the 3 dB realized gain at φ = 41° is achieved, and the main radiating direction, with half-power beamwidth of 5°, steers only ±0.5° from 11.4 to 13.4 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2863115","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; Spanish Government(grant numbers:TEC2016-79700-C2-2-R); Madrid Regional Government(grant numbers:S2013/ICE-3000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425005","Dispersive prism;gap waveguide;leaky-wave antenna (LWA)","Pins;Dispersion;Waveguide discontinuities;Electromagnetic waveguides;Leaky wave antennas;Bandwidth","","90","","47","IEEE","3 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, the design of radiation efficient antennas for UWB signaling is a challenging step in the design and development of impulse radio UWB (IR-UWB) communication systems, especially when these signals coexist with previously standardized narrowband (NB) wireless services. In this paper, a dual-band-notched quad-element UWB multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna design is presented. The proposed design is capable of suppressing NB interference (NBI). The NBI suppression capability of the proposed design is tested both experimentally and through simulations. Moreover, the experimentally measured spectral characteristics of the proposed design are employed in simulating the bit error rate (BER) performance of IR-UWB systems, considering the biphase modulation (BPM) scheme. Both experimental and simulation results show that the proposed design is capable of improving the BER performance of BPM-modulated IR-UWB systems in an NBI environment by suppressing the NBI signals located at six different frequencies within the bandwidth of the two band notches of the proposed design, while introducing a negligible distortion to the IR-UWB signaling waveforms.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2868725","National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Egypt(grant numbers:CFP6); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8454802","Impulse radio (IR);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);narrowband interference (NBI);ultrawide band (UWB)","Antenna measurements;MIMO communication;Ultra wideband antennas;Frequency measurement;Wireless communication;Frequency response","","60","","35","IEEE","5 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Without using complex filtering circuits, the dual-polarized dipole antenna realizes satisfactory filtering performance and enhanced bandwidth by employing only two parasitic loops. Two specific radiation nulls are thus generated and individually controlled by the two parasitic loops. To further improve the upper stopband selectivity and bandwidth, a simple open-ended stub is added to the arms of the dipole. As a result, the bandwidth can be tuned from 7.4% to 47.6% and the realized gain is decreased dramatically from 8.6 dBi at 2.7 GHz (in-band) to -10 dBi at 2.9 GHz (out-of-band). For demonstration, a broadband dual-polarized dipole antenna is implemented. Measured results show that the proposed antenna has more than 34 dB port isolation over 48.7% (1.66-2.73 GHz) impendence bandwidth (VSWR <; 1.5).

One of the main limitations in the design of biomedical systems, which utilize multiple densely spaced antennas, is the mutual coupling created by the radiating elements and the surface waves (SWs). The proposed RBR antenna is designed to achieve an in-phase reflection phase within a wide operating bandwidth. Moreover, it suppresses the SW propagation that reduces the overall mutual coupling by up to 12 dB across the whole operating bandwidth. It consists of a resonance-based loop reflector that is positioned in a perpendicular configuration to a wideband dipole antenna. To increase the electrical size of the loop reflector without physically altering the dimensions of the substrate, its structure is meandered, and a compact side size of 0.22λ × 0.22λ, which is more than 50% smaller than recent RBR antennas, is achieved. Unlike the majority of conventional double-layer high-impedance surfaces, the proposed RBR antenna consists of a single layer and a single unit cell and utilizes the actual dipole antenna element to achieve a measured wideband unidirectional radiation from 0.83 to 1.9 GHz (79%) with a peak gain of 3.8 dBi and a front-to-back ratio of 9 dB. Due to negligible electromagnetic coupling between RBR antennas, lateral SWs are suppressed, and thus multiple antennas can be located adjacent to each other without experiencing any frequency shift or impedance mismatch.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2866516","Advanced Queensland Fellowship(grant numbers:ARC-DP150103614); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443417","Dipole antenna;electromagnetic bandgap (EBG);resonance-based reflector (RBR) antenna","Surface impedance;Reflector antennas;Surface waves;Reflection;Imaging;Impedance","","9","","34","IEEE","21 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a consequence, an analytic solution, which does not require any iterative local/global optimization and inherently fits both radiation and geometry constraints, is derived. The features and the potentialities of the proposed approach are assessed throughout the selected numerical experiments dealing with different (type/size) reflectarray apertures and various (shape/dimension) forbidden regions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2869036","networking activities carried out within the SNATCH(grant numbers:2017–2019); Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Directorate General for Cultural and Economic Promotion and Innovation; Càtedra de Excelencia UC3M-Santander; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8456566","Geometry-constrained design;inverse source (IS) problems;nonradiating (NR) currents;reflectarray current synthesis","Manganese;Geometry;Apertures;Inverse problems;Antenna feeds;Optimization","","38","","40","IEEE","6 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed detector is composed of a two-element long-wave infrared (LWIR) biomimetic antenna array. The detector consists of two closely spaced and strongly coupled IR antennas whose natural mutual coupling is augmented by using an external coupling network. Each antenna is connected to a microbolometer to detect the incoming IR radiation. By controlling the mutual coupling between the antennas and designing an optimum coupling network, the ratio of the power absorbed in the two bolometers is made to a one-to-one function of the incidence angle. This allows for determining the angle of incidence of the incoming IR light by measuring the changes of the dc currents passing through the bolometers when the antennas are biased with a dc voltage source. A prototype of the proposed angle-sensing detector is designed to operate at 10.6 μm in the LWIR band. The prototype is fabricated and characterized. Measurement results show that the device has a one-to-one response function for transverse electric waves within a field of view of ±60°. The response of the device for incident waves having the transverse magnetic or random polarizations was also simulated and measured.

The array consists of 16 dual exponentially tapered slot antenna (DETSA) elements. Each element is integrated with a radio frequency receiver, an intermediate frequency chain, and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The H-plane radiation pattern of the proposed DETSA is very wide to enable the beam scanning in the azimuth plane. The beam gain is further enhanced by employing a 1-D multilayered planar lens that transforms the spherical wave into a plane wave in the E-plane for increasing the beam gain and keeping the phase compensation unaltered in the H-plane. Meanwhile, the planar lens is optimized to guarantee the wide scanning angle. In addition, all the signals received by the 16 independent channels are converted to a digital signal via ADC simultaneously and then used for synthesizing the multibeam patterns in the digital domain. Furthermore, the calibration and the verification of the synthesizing weights are discussed in detail. The measured results show that a scanning coverage of ±40° in the H-plane (or in horizontal plane) and an estimated maximum gain of 24.8 dBi with a gain tolerance of 3 dB can be achieved by the proposed 16-element array with a 1-D lens.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2869200","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61627801); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457292","Beamforming;lens antenna;massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);millimeter waves (mmWs);multibeam array;wireless communications","Antenna arrays;Lenses;Gain;Array signal processing;MIMO communication;Antenna measurements","","69","","28","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from the single FI pattern array case, every element channel in the multiple FI pattern array is divided and followed by multiple finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters, and each of the multiple FIR filters has a set of coefficients. In this situation, a collective filter coefficient vector and its energy bound are introduced for each element, and then the problem of reducing the number of elements is transformed as minimizing the number of active collective filter coefficient vectors. In addition, the radiation characteristics including beam pointing direction, mainlobe FI property, sidelobe level, and space-frequency notching requirement for each of the multiple patterns can be formulated as multiple convex constraints. The whole synthesis method is implemented by performing an iterative second-order cone programming (SOCP). This method can be considered as a significant extension of the original SOCP for synthesizing broadband sparse array with single FI pattern. Numerical synthesis results show that the proposed method by synthesizing multiple discretized crossover FI patterns can save more elements than the original iterative SOCP by using a single continuously scannable FI pattern for covering the same space range.

In reflectarray synthesis, a novel modes superposition synthesis method (MSSM) based on linear superposition of the unit TE and TM mode responses is proposed. The MSSM can take the real incident angles, polarizations of incident fields, and the quasi-periodic reflectarray environment into account.

Several of these arrays are being developed with bare absorbing meshes without any antenna coupling (lens or horn) structures. The design of such arrays is typically done resorting to geometrical considerations or basic broadside plane wave incidence analysis. This paper presents a spectral technique for the analysis of such focal plane arrays in reception using Fourier Optics, which is valid also for moderately skewed incident angles. The analysis constitutes a step improvement with respect to previously used methods by providing an accurate and efficient way to estimate the point-source angular response and the throughput from a distributed incoherent source of an absorbing mesh in the focal plane of a quasi-optical component (e.g., a parabolic reflector or lens). The proposed technique is validated with full-wave simulations. After presenting the analysis, this paper compares the performance of arrays of bare absorber in the focal plane of a quasi-optical component to those of corresponding antenna based arrays. It is found that absorbers lead to a comparable tradeoff, in terms of spill-over and focusing efficiency, only for very tight samplings. For larger samplings, the focusing efficiency of absorbers is significantly lower than the one for antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2862359","European Research Council Starting(grant numbers:ERC-2014-StG LAA-THz-CC,639749); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424188","Quasi-optics;radiometry;reflector antenna feeds;sub-millimeter-wave detectors","Antenna arrays;Optical reflection;Optical sensors;Antenna feeds;Optical imaging","","17","","52","IEEE","1 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For simplicity, the resonators are made to work for only a single polarization. To design the FSS, first, a classical dual-band bandpass filter circuit is designed by performing successive frequency transformations on a lowpass prototype. The filter is then transformed into a form resembling the equivalent circuit of the proposed multilayer FSS structure. Finally, the transformed filter is mapped to a set of FSS geometrical parameters. The method presents very few inherent limitations to realizing a diverse range of filter responses. The resulting designs lend themselves to fabrication since very few layers of metallization are required.

However, fabricating and characterizing these elements present many challenges that have yet to be addressed. For example, conventional free-space measurement techniques require intractably large arrays to uniformly illuminate the sample and mitigate edge diffraction at extreme incidence angles. To mitigate these effects, a broadband focused beam measurement technique is proposed to characterize a finite 24×48 element 3-D FSS array optimized for C-band operation. Elements are fabricated using PolyJet 3-D printing, metallized, and encapsulated in a Sylgard-527 substrate over a polymethylmethacrylate lattice resulting in a low-loss, low-cost, low-profile, and lightweight array that is suitable for conformal surfaces and can be easily repaired. A comparison of simulated and measured results is presented, and a discussion of the implications of the array and measurement system is offered. The fully fabricated 3-D FSS array achieves a 6.25% -10 dB rejection band and 8.26% 3 dB passband at 5.6 and 7.75 GHz, respectively, for both TE and TM polarizations and incidence angles up to 72°.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2866507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443377","Additive manufacturing;angularly stable;ant colony optimization;periodic structures;polarization independent;3-D frequency selective structures (FSSs)","Three-dimensional displays;Frequency selective surfaces;Finite element analysis;Fabrication;Three-dimensional printing;Periodic structures;Antenna measurements","","42","","25","IEEE","21 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a direct spectral approach where the convolution is carried out with due account for the presence of a singular kernel. Using Contour-FFT, the integration contour is deformed and the spatial convolution is expressed as a rapidly converging series of FFTs.

This paper presents a new reduced-order modeling technique to compute scattering and radiation from large arrays of complex scatterers and antennas. In the proposed technique, each element of the array is replaced by an equivalent electric current distribution on a fictitious closed surface enclosing the element. This equivalent electric current density is derived using the equivalence theorem, and it is related to the surface currents on the scatterer by the Stratton-Chu formulation. With the proposed approach, instead of directly solving for the unknown surface current density on the scatterers, we only need to solve for the unknowns on the equivalent surface. This approach leads to a reduction in the number of unknowns and better conditioning when it is applied to problems involving complex scatterers with multiscale features. Furthermore, the proposed approach is accelerated with the adaptive integral equation method to solve large problems. As illustrated in several practical examples, the proposed method yields the speedup of up to 20 times and consumes up to 12 times less memory than the standard method of moments accelerated with the adaptive integral method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2866509","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443365","Adaptive integral equation method;equivalence theorem;macromodel;multiscale problems;reduced-order modeling;surface integral equation (SIE) method","Antenna arrays;Current;Current density;Acceleration;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Magnetic domains","","12","","53","IEEE","21 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, there is great uncertainty in the content of the ionosphere at any given moment. In this paper, global stochastic finite-difference time-domain models of the earth-ionosphere waveguide are generated for the first time. These models use the Galerkin-based polynomial chaos expansion method to efficiently calculate both the mean and variance of the electric and magnetic fields due to uncertainties and variances in the state of the ionosphere.

The scattering field, radar cross section (RCS), and frequency shifts are discussed in both horizontal and vertical polarizations. The wave tank observations show that backscattering enhancement occurs when water wavelength is an integer multiple of Bragg wavelength, and there are several Doppler harmonics with frequency shifts of water-wave frequency and its integer multiples. Numerical simulations indicate that these Doppler harmonics except the one associated with the water-wave phase velocity are caused by the water surface edge effect. Moreover, theoretical analyses, numerical simulations, and wave tank experiments all show a clear exponential relationship between backscattering RCS and wave height. In addition, we further analyze the bistatic scattering and find that the scattering field is composed of plane waves propagating in the directions determined by water wavelength and radio wavelength, the bistatic frequency shift is the harmonic frequency of water wave, and the bistatic RCS also has an exponential relation with water-wave height.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2866526","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371063,41706200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8444717","Bragg and non-Bragg scattering;Doppler measurements;method of moments (MoM);numerical analysis;perturbation methods","Scattering;Doppler effect;Backscatter;Method of moments;Surface waves;Radar cross-sections","","4","","29","IEEE","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The successful generation of time-varying magnetic fields produced by the physical rotation of a 3 cm3 permanent magnet is demonstrated. Ground plane and receiver orientation effects are analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. Observations as a function of distance from the source indicate that the fields are dominated by the static component, rather than by the radiation component, of the generated field. Based on these observations, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a spinning magnet source is predicted to be weak. Nevertheless, static magnetic signaling using this technique is proven to be both possible and practical at frequencies below ~500 Hz and at distances in excess of 100 m.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2869205","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:HR00111820013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457248","Magnetic field measurements;permanent magnets;radio transmitters","Ground penetrating radar;Geophysical measurement techniques;Magnetic moments;Tools;Magnetic field measurement;Spinning;Receivers","","89","","27","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An anatomically realistic 3-D-head model and a numerical analysis technique based on a finite-difference time-domain convolution approach are adopted to formulate the electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive domain represented by fourth-order Debye model. The variance in the calculated scalogram and the Shannon wavelet entropy of the filtered backscattered signals in time/scale plane at spatial antennas around the head would play a crucial role to detect the defection in the computational domain. Beside the cost and scarce availability of expensive stroke diagnostic tools, we claim that the proposed microwave diagnosis scheme can be a promising, efficient portable tool.

The antenna has compact dimensions of 63 mm x 54 mm (2.32λ0x 1.99λ0) with a low profile of 7 mm (0.26λ0). To understand the operating principle of the two-port SIW antenna clearly, modal analysis is performed for single-port SIW antenna.

Although the separation between the two central slots is minimized to 4 mm (0.14λ0), the isolation performance remains excellent (less than -30 dB). The gain enhancement, with a narrow beam pattern for radar applications, is realized using constructive superposition of in-phase electromagnetic energy from the two slots.

This is due to the fact that potential frequency bands and system bandwidths are undecided for mm-wave systems and it is likely that multibands with scalable system bandwidths will be supported. In this communication, a frequency-extension scheme based on frequency up-and-down conversion and a novel bandwidth enhancement scheme based on the band-combining principle are proposed to upgrade the existing sub-6 GHz CE to meet the requirements in the mm-wave CE design. The designed mm-wave CE is experimentally validated, where the measured Doppler and delay profiles agree well with the target ones. Moreover, the beamforming validation measurements showed that excellent gain and phase control of the mm-wave CE output ports can be realized.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2864339","Innovation Fund Denmark via the VIRTUalized envirOnment for Communication System Development and Optimization Project; Danish Council for Independent Research(grant numbers:DFF611100525); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8429507","Multipath channels;radio propagation;testing","Bandwidth;Radio frequency;Fading channels;Doppler effect;Testing;Frequency conversion;Antennas","","21","","16","IEEE","8 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To avoid this problem, we resort to a frequency-invariant beamformer for the evaluation of the angular-temporal spectra of the RC. Contrary to the previous studies, it is found that modest loading does not increase the statistical anisotropy in the delay domain (after the ramp-up stage of the power delay profile) as compared with the unloaded case, implying that modest loading does not alter RC's angular statistics for over-the-air testing.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2864343","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801366); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8429904","Angular–temporal spectra;reverberation chamber (RC);turntable platform","Delays;Frequency measurement;Loading;Antenna measurements;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Broadband antennas;Azimuth","","20","","29","IEEE","8 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this communication, we employ both the amplitude and the phase information to improve the estimation accuracy and eliminate phase ambiguity without increasing the size of the antenna array. The optimal amplitude ratio between the antenna patterns is theoretically studied using the theories of the Fisher information, Cramér-Rao bound, and ambiguity function. Criteria of proper amplitude ratio are summarized from the theoretical investigations. Following the guidelines, two antenna arrays are modified to build effective antenna patterns and improve the estimation accuracy. Specifically, the compact monopole-patch array and the dual-monopole array reduce the DOA estimation errors by over 60% and 20%-40%, respectively, under a medium SNR of 10 dB. The phase ambiguity has been eliminated in both arrays as well. The monopole-patch array requires phase calibration in the measurement, whereas the dual-monopole array does not. Experiments were carried out for the dual-monopole array in the anechoic chamber, achieving the estimation accuracy of 0.67° averaged over 360°.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2866989","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601079); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M631779); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:20170540169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445577","Compact antenna array;direction finding;direction of arrival (DOA) estimation;multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna system;multiple signal classification (MuSiC)","Estimation;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Phased arrays;Signal to noise ratio;Directive antennas","","6","","18","IEEE","24 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it lacks some of the important aspects and may create an incorrect impression about transmit beamforming of MIMO radars. This comment shows that the virtual transmit beam pattern cannot reflect the practical radiation energy of the radar array. Even the virtual transmit beam pattern has nulls in the preselected directions, the clutter from these directions cannot be alleviated at the radar receiver, and the MIMO radar signals would still be detectable in these directions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2016.2620058","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401062); Science and Technology on Electronic Information Control Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514100","Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar;phased-array radar;virtual transmit beamforming","Radar antennas;Array signal processing;MIMO radar;Antenna arrays;MIMO communication;Optimization","","8","","3","IEEE","29 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In [2], the waveform design was carried out in the space domain only (coding the phases for different elements at the same moment) to form a desired transmit beam pattern at a given moment. However, if the MIMO radar waveforms are designed to satisfy the requirements in transmit beamforming (i.e., generating radiation nulls in specific directions) as well as the orthogonality between the waveforms transmitted from different elements, they must be coded simultaneously in space-time domains [3]. It turns out that the space-time coded waveforms cannot be exactly orthogonal in time domain. More specifically, to form a beam pattern with radiation null on a preselected direction, the waveforms can be optimized to be near-orthogonal with their cross correlation levels of about 1/ $N$  with  $N $  being the coding length. In [1], the authors questioned if the radiation energy in the preselected target direction could really be reduced or minimized based on (2). Since the cross correlations of the designed waveforms are nontrivial for a reasonable coding length, (2) does not hold true for the designed waveforms, and thus, cannot refute the conclusions obtained in [2]. In addition, the evaluation of (2), which is similar to the result of matched filtering, requires the full knowledge of the transmitted waveforms and cannot be done by a noncooperative target. Therefore, the designed MIMO radar waveforms in [2] and [3] would generate near-zero or very weak radiation (defocused beam) in the intended direction and are theoretically undetectable by noncooperative targets in the same direction.1 However, for MIMO radar itself with full knowledge of transmit waveforms, target detection can be performed with the maximum gain through refocusing transmit-receive beam via space-time matched filtering processing at the radar receiver.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2861983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8429924","","Antenna arrays;MIMO radar;Radar antennas;Array signal processing;Transmitting antennas;Radar signal processing","","1","","3","IEEE","8 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
