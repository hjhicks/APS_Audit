This technique is based on the use of two sets of characteristic modes. The first one is associated with an open circuit at the antenna input port while the second is associated with a short circuit at the antenna input port. The link of this analyze with a classical modal approach by a rational fraction approximation of the input impedance is demonstrated. This technique is first applied to a basic folded monopole antenna, then to a disc-loaded folded monopole antenna in the aim to optimize its bandwidth and radiation pattern while reducing its size. The disc-loaded folded monopole antenna is modeled and measured. Its voltage standing wave ratio performances are equivalent to those of the Goubau antenna for equivalent dimensions. The radiation pattern is monopolelike on the full bandwidth.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2835516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357904","Characteristic modes;compact antenna;loaded antenna;modal analysis;monopole antenna;poles and zeros;rational fraction Goubau antenna;wide bandwidth","Impedance;Bandwidth;Boundary conditions;Loaded antennas;Poles and zeros;Antenna radiation patterns","","4","","26","IEEE","11 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A problem is the presence of an open stopband (OSB), which restricts radiation in the broadside direction. In this paper, a novel substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)-based LWA is described to overcome the OSB problem and provide beam scanning continuously from the backward to the forward direction from a conventional periodic LWA. It is demonstrated that the $n =-1$ spatial harmonic can be excited efficiently from an SIW LWA and enables broadside radiation. However, it was found in our initial design that when the beam scans through the broadside, the cross-polarization level increases significantly compared to the beam close to the backfire direction. A technique is developed to reduce the cross-polarization level. As a result, a new antenna configuration is created. The antenna design has been realized and measured to validate the concept. The measured beam scanning range of the prototype is from -74° to +45° (119° of beam scanning) when the frequency sweeps from 7.625 to 11 GHz, and the measured cross-polarization level is 20.8 dB low at the main beam direction for the broadside beam.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2835502","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:160102219); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357818","Backward-to-forward scanning;beam scanning;broadside beam;leaky-wave antenna (LWA);open stopband (OSB);substrate integrated waveguides (SIWs)","Substrates;Harmonic analysis;Antenna measurements;Microstrip;Directive antennas;Photonic band gap","","85","","41","IEEE","11 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their impedance profile including the probe parameters has been identified as the controlling factor to the cross-polarized (XP) profile over the band. Subsequently, a well-defined co-relation between the input and XP radiations has been established which leads to a theoretical model. Based on this understanding, an engineered feed with controlled reactance has been conjectured and proposed to achieve improved XP profile with increased polarization purity.

The LPDA is required to provide low standing wave ratio as well as high-gain radiation pattern with sufficient gain flatness over the entire passband, and concurrently achieve low gain for frequencies above 800 MHz to reject LTE800 signals and thus improve the reception quality in the DVB-T band. All the above requirements are better satisfied by applying a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO) variant, called PSO with velocity mutation (PSOvm). PSOvm induces mutation on the velocities of those particles, which are unable to improve their fitness. As shown in this paper, PSOvm comes closer to the above requirements compared to four well-known optimization methods and outperforms the traditional LPDA design method proposed by Carrel. The LPDA geometry chosen for optimization is not the conventional one, and therefore the dipoles are not considered to be included inside a specified angle as proposed by Carrel. Thus, the dipole lengths and distances as well as the boom dimensions are independently optimized.

In this paper, we synthesize a sparse array for DM based on convex optimization. The main idea is that a nonconvex optimization problem associated with ℓ0-norm is formulated for synthesizing a sparse array. To solve this nonconvex optimization problem, two different solutions are employed to relax the nonconvex optimization problem in a convex way: one is based on iterative reweighted ℓ1-norm resulting in a superdirective array, the other is based on mixed integer programming resulting in a nonsuperdirective array. Furthermore, multiple important metrics of a DM transmitter, such as power efficiency, information beamwidth, and dynamic DM signal, are also considered in the optimization problem to achieve better performance of the DM signal via a sparse array. Simulation results show that the proposed synthesis method provides greater flexibility of controlling the security performance, power efficiency, and static or dynamic DM signal while the number of excitations is less than the uniformly spaced linear array in the benchmark problems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2835641","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91738201,61302102); Jiangsu Provincial College and University Project(grant numbers:16KJB510026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357940","Convex optimization;directional modulation (DM);dynamic DM signal;information beam;physical layer security;power efficiency;sparse array","Phased arrays;Transmitters;Optimization;Measurement;Signal synthesis;Linear programming;Security","","25","","43","IEEE","11 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transmit-array transforms the known power radiation pattern of the primary source into a desired output power pattern. The proposed formulation, specialized for axial-symmetric structures, is based on geometrical optics and provides the solution directly from the evaluation of two closed-form first-order differential equations. As a proof of concept, a sec2 with a roll-off at 45° is defined as the target power pattern, at the 30 GHz Ka-band. A 10.8 dBi radiation pattern with the circular polarization is used to illuminate a 180 mm $\times \,\, 180$ mm transmit array with 60 mm focal distance. Previously designed 3.35 mm thick phase-delay unit cells are used as an example to implement the calculated phase distribution over the transmit-array aperture.

On the other hand, array thinning is an efficient method of achieving narrow beamwidth (high angular resolution) with fewer number of elements. Reducing the number of elements results in reducing weight, cost, hardware complexity, and energy consumption. In this paper, a novel dynamic programming algorithm of array thinning with the objective of reducing sidelobe levels (SLLs), desired for large circular arrays, is proposed. The circular array is partitioned into annular rings, and the objective of the optimization problem is to determine the number of active elements in each ring. Then, active elements of the rings are selected. Although optimal array thinning is an NP-hard problem, converting the problem of selecting active elements into the number of active elements in each ring causes a huge reduction in computational complexity of the proposed algorithm that makes it affordable for large arrays. Moreover, beampatterns with very low SLLs are synthesized.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2842258","Sharif University of Technology(grant numbers:QB960606); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8370117","Array thinning;dynamic programming (DP);narrow beamwidth;sidelobe level (SLL)","Phased arrays;Complexity theory;Heuristic algorithms;Aperture antennas;Dynamic programming","","13","","39","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such devices offer a means to overcome the implementation difficulties associated with standard metasurfaces (consisting of closely packed subwavelength meta-atoms) and the relatively low efficiencies of gradient metasurfaces. In contrast to previous work, in which accurate systematic design was limited to metagratings unrealistically suspended in free space, we derive herein a closed-form formalism allowing the realization of printed circuit board (PCB) metagrating perfect reflectors, comprised of loaded conducting strips defined on a standard metal-backed dielectric substrate. The derivation yields a detailed procedure for the determination of the substrate thickness and conductor geometry required to achieve unitary coupling efficiencies, without requiring even a single full-wave simulation.

The FSR consists of a resistive sheet and a bandpass frequency-selective surface (FSS). The impedance conditions of absorption/transmission for both the resistive sheet and the bandpass FSS are theoretically derived based on equivalent circuit analysis. The insertion loss of FSR at the resonant frequency of lossless bandpass FSS is proven to be only related to the equivalent impedance of the resistive sheet. When the resistive sheet is in parallel resonance at the passband, a nearly transparent window can be achieved regardless of lossy properties. An interdigital resonator (IR) is designed to realize parallel resonance in the resistive element by extending one finger of a strip-type interdigital capacitor to connect the two separate parts of the capacitor. The IR is equivalent to a parallel LC circuit. Lumped resistors are loaded around the IR to absorb the incident wave at lower and upper absorption bands.

The reflection coefficient is approximated by an iterative approach for the solution of the so-called mixed potential integral equations. The iteration is initialized by the classical transmission line solution. The tangential electric field on the surface of the thin wire corresponding to the classical solution is then used as a distributed source to determine a correction term for the current. By this way, the scattering of the transverse electromagnetic modes at the discontinuity is included. Very good agreement between the analytic solution and a numerical one is observed.

In this paper, we develop an accurate FDTD subgridding algorithm suitable for arbitrary subgridding settings with arbitrary contrast ratios between the normal grid and the subgrid. Although the resulting system matrix is also unsymmetric, we develop a time-marching method to overcome the stability problem without sacrificing the matrix-free merit of the original FDTD. This method is general, which is also applicable to other subgridding algorithms whose underlying numerical systems are unsymmetric. The proposed FDTD subgridding algorithm is then further made unconditionally stable, thus permitting the use of a time step independent of space step.

Unfortunately, standard modeling techniques are unable to ensure sufficient predictive power for real-world antenna structures (multiple parameters, wide parameter ranges, and highly nonlinear responses). Here, a design-oriented modeling technique is introduced, in which the most critical part is the domain definition. The surrogate is constructed in the region based on a set of reference designs, optimized with respect to user-selected figures of interest such as operating frequencies, bandwidth, and substrate permittivity. The domain is spanned by the simplexes, obtained by triangulation of the reference designs, further extended into their orthogonal complements. Restricting the model domain as above permits dramatic reduction of the number of training data samples necessary to build a reliable model, as compared to the conventional approach. The proposed modeling framework is demonstrated using three examples, a UWB monopole, and two dual-band antennas.

Two data fusion methods for combining the DFCW and CW range estimates are proposed and their performance is compared based on measurement results with a backscatter RF tag system operating in the 5.8 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band. Each data fusion method uses spatial averaging, as the RF tag is moved through space to reduce the overall system error. The efficacy of spatial averaging is investigated by showing that multipath and hardware imperfections cause oscillating errors in the phase used for ranging and the errors are significantly reduced through spatial averaging.

A geometrical approach is used to model channel depolarization, where the MIMO signal contributions of the scatterers are determined from a greatly simplified ray-tracing method. The modeling method provides a mechanism for computing MIMO-polarized channel impulse responses analytically, and the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and MIMO time-frequency function are further derived. The proposed model shows good agreement with measurements and simulation results from the literature and provides insights on the MIMO channel depolarization behavior. In addition, numerical simulations with appropriate modeling parameters are conducted. The XPD is shown to depend on the distribution of scatterers and MIMO subchannel index. Moreover, the co-polar channel is shown to have a higher time-frequency correlation than the cross-polar channel. This should be carefully considered in a multipolarized antenna system design.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2839758","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771037,61501020,61725101); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:4182047); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2016YFB1200102-04,2016YFE0200900); State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety(grant numbers:RCS2018ZT014); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2018JBM301); Teaching Reform Project(grant numbers:134496522,134493522); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362977","Channel modeling;cross-polarization discrimination (XPD);mobile to mobile (M2M);multiple input multiple output (MIMO);polarization","MIMO communication;Machine-to-machine communications;Antennas;Three-dimensional displays;Correlation;Channel models;Mathematical model","","11","","48","IEEE","23 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, when the electromagnetic waves cannot penetrate the shielding walls (such as metallic walls), a problem called “hard-wall radar imaging” (HWRI) must be investigated. As the objects are located in the shadow region, where only the diffracted field can be reflected back via edges, conventional imaging techniques are not applicable. The HWRI problem is an imaging scenario with an intrinsic multipath of signal propagation. Therefore, it has been studied using a model-based time-reversal (TR) decomposition of TR operator imaging method. In this paper, an imaging technique with a distributed transmitting and receiving array is proposed as a robust way resolving the problem with a low signal-to-clutter ratio in TR imaging. In this method, the interelement response matrix is collected for the construction of the covariance matrix, from which the geometry of the hard wall is determined from the direction of arrival by the multiple signal classification techniques. Next, the adaptive interference cancellation technique is applied to suppress the interference terms in the image function due to the multipath effects.

To realize efficient power transfer, the system is typically brought to resonance, and the coupled-antenna mode is optimized to reduce radiation into the surrounding space. In this scheme, any modification of the receiver position or its electromagnetic properties results in the necessity of dynamically tuning the whole system to restore the resonant matching condition. It implies poor robustness to the receiver location and load impedance, as well as additional energy consumption in the control network. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm for wireless power delivery based on which the whole system, including transmitter and receiver and the space in between, forms a unified microwave power generator. In our proposed scenario, the load itself becomes a part of the generator. Microwave oscillations are created directly at the receiver location, eliminating the need for dynamical tuning of the system within the range of the self-oscillation regime. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we experimentally show that, such self-oscillating wireless power delivery systems can provide robust operation against changes in the environment or in the location of the load. The proposed concept has relevant connections with the recent interest in parity-time symmetric systems, in which balanced loss and gain distributions enable unusual electromagnetic responses.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2835560","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme-Future Emerging Topics (FETOPEN)(grant numbers:736876); NU ORAU(grant numbers:20162031); MES RK State-Targeted Program(grant numbers:BR05236454); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357932","Parity-time symmetry reflection;resonance;transmission;wireless power transfer","Microwave oscillators;Wireless communication;Generators;Resistance;Microwave antennas;Microwave circuits;Receivers","","39","","19","IEEE","11 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The radiation centers for E- and H-planes of the antenna are determined. Antenna rotation in these planes, with respect to an arbitrary axis, results in the time delays (advances) of the recorded receiving pulses for various angles. The purpose of the measurements is to find the rotation axes providing minimum time delays of the radiated pulse registration at the receiving antenna for the largest possible range of observation angles.

With a squared arch design, the proposed slot antenna can keep the H-plane beamwidth relatively the same in the dual bands.

The most common launcher for this waveguide is a quarter-wavelength monopole, which generates a cylindrical wave. However, in order to approximate the cylindrical wave to a plane-wave impinging on the device under test, this launcher needs electrically large setups. The proposed solution makes use of a metallic bidimensional parabolic reflector, which is able to transform the cylindrical wave radiated by the conventional launcher into a plane wave with the Gaussian amplitude distribution.

The upper microstrip substrate is not in electric contact with the lower feed network, which relaxes the fabrication process considerably. The 64-element array consists of 16 2-by-2 subarrays arranged to form an 8-by-8 configuration of array elements. To ensure minimum feed losses, the subarrays are excited by a corporate feed network composed of groove-gap-waveguide components. The first part of the feed network consists of the ground plane of the antenna array which also plays the role of the upper plate of the waveguide network. The second part is an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) structure realized within the lower plate of the waveguide feed network via milling. In this communication, the AMC structure is made of a bed-of-nails. Array elements are rectangular patches showing 8.85 dBi gain each at the center frequency. The maximum measured gain of the antenna array is 26.18 dBi, which is equivalent to 57.81% aperture efficiency.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2835722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357889","Antenna array feeds;feeds;microstrip arrays;waveguides","Microstrip antenna arrays;Waveguide discontinuities;Microstrip;Hollow waveguides;Microstrip antennas;Antenna feeds","","14","","15","IEEE","11 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The array element consists of a corner-fed patch with a tilted slot cut at its edge, which suppresses unwanted modes in order to generate the desired 45° linear polarization. Comparing to a traditional 45° tilted patch, the proposed element gets rid of the bending feedline and realizes a higher isolation level between adjacent patches in the side-by-side arrangement. For proof-of-concept demonstration, a $2 \times 8$ array with 45° linear polarization was fabricated and measured, exhibiting a good agreement between simulation and measured results. The proposed array prototype possesses a -10 dB impedance bandwidth of 10.6% (74.3-82.5 GHz). Moreover, a dual $1 \times 8$ array with ±45° dual polarization is also presented, showing a bandwidth of 9.7% (74.4-81.9 GHz) and a high isolation level of greater than 25 dB. The proposed E-band planar arrays own the advantages of low profile, i.e., $\sim 0.067\lambda _{0}$ , single layer, low fabrication cost, simple structure, wide operational bandwidth, i.e., ~10%, and polarization flexibility. They represent promising candidates for high-speed E-band communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2840825","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61627801); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8365759","45° linear polarization;dual polarization;low profile;millimeter-wave (mmW) array antenna;wideband array antenna","Linear antenna arrays;Broadband antennas;Microstrip;Wideband;Fabrication","","48","","29","IEEE","25 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The converter is constructed of a periodic array of the dielectric substrate sandwiched with simply artificial structures, in which the top layer and bottom layer are connected by metallic vias. The proposed polarizer can convert the linearly polarized incident electromagnetic wave to its orthogonal counterpart in the transmission mode. The conversion mechanism is explained by both equivalent circuit model and full-wave simulations. The simulation and measured results have a good agreement in the entire frequency range. Such a scheme of the ultrathin cross-polarization converter has simple geometry and can be used in microwave communications, remote sensing, and imaging.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2839972","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61522106,61571117,61501117,61501112,61631007); National Instrumentation Program(grant numbers:2013YQ200647); Foundation of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China(grant numbers:201444); 111 Project 111-2-05; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362931","Cross-polarization conversion;equivalent circuit (EC);high efficiency;transmitted mode","Integrated circuit modeling;Equivalent circuits;Substrates;Resonant frequency;Antenna measurements;Dielectric substrates;Microwave filters","","69","","27","IEEE","23 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aggregate basis functions composed of Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions are defined, which leads to a good decrease in the number of unknowns, but with the enough accuracy. To obtain the aggregate basis functions, the approximate solution is implemented. By taking advantage of the nature of periodic array, the filling number of the impedance matrix blocks is substantially decreased, and the procedure of getting the approximate solutions is accelerated. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated in a typical scattering example.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2836666","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61331007,61571085,61301271); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8359262","Aggregate basis function;composite structures;periodic array;scattering","Aggregates;Periodic structures;Current;Filling;Electromagnetic scattering;Antenna arrays;Method of moments","","3","","21","IEEE","15 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other side, due to its very challenging nature, very few methods have been proposed up to now in the literature. In this communication, starting from the well-known time reversal (TR) technique, a simple innovative approach, the so-called optimized multi-target TR (O-mt-TR), is presented. The strategy is based on the optimization of the phase shifts between the time-reversed fields in a number of control points within the target region. In doing so, the proposed method outperforms the simple juxtaposition of time-reversed fields pursued by the so-called mt-TR, or even succeed in cases in which the latter fails completely. This capability of the proposed method is assessed through a numerical analysis concerned with a 3-D inhomogeneous scenario, in which the results are quantitatively appraised in terms of coverage of the target areas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2841412","Italian Ministry of Research through PRIN Field and Temperature Shaping for MWI Hyperthermia—FAT SAMMY.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8368155","Antenna array;multispot focusing;phase shift;spatial field shaping;time reversal","Focusing;Antenna arrays;Optimization;Linear programming;Numerical analysis;Hyperthermia","","42","","23","IEEE","28 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
