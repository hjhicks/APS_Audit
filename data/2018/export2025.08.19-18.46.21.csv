Therefore, this paper is an attempt to clarify some of the ambiguity and confusion caused by these definitions. A detailed comparison of Ludwig's second and thirrd definitions of cross polarization, as applied to linearly polarized antennas, was performed. The results show that, in the diagonal plane, Ludwig's second definition leads to a lower crosspolarization level than the third definition for x- or y-polarized current sources. For a Huygens source, by Ludwig's third definition, the radiation pattern has a lower cross-polarization level than that obtained by Ludwig's second definition. For some applications, the antenna is usually placed in the yz plane. Therefore, new polarization bases are proposed according to which the source is used as a reference, and also on how this source is oriented in the yz plane. To complement the theoretical framework demonstrated in this contribution and to provide readers with a better and simpler understanding of the crosspolarization definition, the analysis of several practical antennas for diverse applications was presented. Numerical and measured radiation patterns of wire and printed dipoles, rectangular patch, pyramidal horn, and open-ended rectangular waveguide (OEWG) antennas were investigated according to the polarization formulations presented in this paper. In addition, a dual-polarized element and a dual-polarized active phased array at broadside were utilized to generalize the application.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2845945","NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory under CIMMS Cooperative Agreement(grant numbers:NA11OAR4320072); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8379345","Cross polarization;far-field polarization;Ludwig’s definitions;phased array;polarization diversity;radar systems;source current polarization","Antenna radiation patterns;Polarization;Dipole antennas;Antenna accessories;Antenna measurements;Spaceborne radar","","25","","16","IEEE","11 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Antennas can also be characterized as a two-port network to ascertain the antenna transfer function (S21). This characterization is important in point-to-point (P2P) communication, as the frequency response can vary due to changes in the radiation pattern in the physical channel. This paper presents a process to investigate the frequency response of a wideband antenna in order to identify the best orientation of the antenna for P2P communication. The process predicts the antenna's effective aperture and gain for each orientation. An equivalent circuit for the wideband antenna is also derived to obtain the total radiated power. The frequency-variant radiation pattern is ascertained from the S21 phase obtained from the equivalent circuit. For each orientation, the S21 phase is analyzed based on the linear, minimum, and all-pass phase components, which enables the derivation of an equivalent circuit. The variation of group delay for each orientation is also obtained and compared. The measurements between two identical antennas at the two orientations with a free-space channel were then modeled for simulation in a digital system. This simulation predicts the antenna effects for the two orientations used. Finally, this process was validated by using a nonminimum-phase monopole ultra-wideband antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2851367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8404064","Circuit modeling;digital systems;phase distortion;transfer functions;ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas","Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna measurements;Equivalent circuits;Ultra wideband antennas;Transmitting antennas;Aperture antennas","","9","","20","CCBY","5 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Owing to different loading effects of the microstrip stub and conformal strip, the resonance frequency of TE1δ1y mode excited by the two feed lines is slightly different. Such stepping resonances yield a wide bandwidth of 21.9% and a very flat gain of 5.1 dBi. The hybrid-feeding scheme also establishes a cross-coupled structure in the DRA, which introduces two radiation nulls right near the band edges. A compact wideband filtering DRA (FDRA) with quasi-elliptic bandpass response is, therefore, obtained without requiring any specific filtering circuit. This single-polarized design is also modified to realize a dual-polarized FDRA by adding another orthogonal port with the same feeding scheme.

The electric field of the excited high-order mode forms several stable null-amplitude field points located on the edge of the ground plane. The other IFA is then placed in one of the stable null points. By doing this, the two IFAs are decoupled with high isolation. The simulated results show that isolation improvements of 20–40 dB can be achieved when the positions and orientations of the two IFAs are optimized. The measured results confirm that the fabricated antennas have peak isolations of 45–56 dB.

The discrepancy between calculation and simulation results is merely 2.7%. In addition, a tuning mechanism of the patch antenna on the LC substrate is verified depending on the strength of a biasing voltage. The calculated results of the theoretical model indicate that the resonant frequency is shifted toward lower direction and 3-dB beamwidth of radiation pattern increases as the bias voltage increases. Although the calculated maximum directivity decreases with the increment of voltage, the realized gain increases due to the radiation efficiency of the antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2851304","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:2016R1A2B4010918); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401523","Liquid crystal (LC) devices;microstrip antennas;modeling;reconfigurable antennas","Patch antennas;Substrates;Resonant frequency;Microstrip antennas;Permittivity;Antenna radiation patterns;Mathematical model","","18","","19","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting module can provide versatile reconfigurabilities for textile antennas, with secure protection for the rigid electronics while maintaining stable and repeatable electrical connection to the flexible metalized textiles. To demonstrate the concept, a dual-band frequency-reconfigurable wearable textile patch antenna with a dedicated varactor-loaded module is designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. Good agreement observed between simulation and measurement results validates the concept of the reconfiguration module. The antenna exhibits tuning ranges of 32.8% and 8.8% for its two operation bands designed to include the 2.45 and 5.8 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical radio bands, respectively.

Their radiation pattern is wide since the radiator extension is typically about half wavelength. In a package, the wide radiation pattern is easily disturbed by interference from parasitic radiation of the package. In this paper, an approach to minimize and adjust the interference of the package is proposed and applied to a quad flat no leads (QFN) package housing. A structured metal sheet positioned between chip and exposed pad is used to generate enough degrees of freedom for the optimization of the 3-D-radiation pattern in open-cavity and molded QFN packages. For the open-cavity QFN package, a U-shaped slot is introduced, which reduces the propagation of surface waves to the sides and creates a uniform radiation pattern. For the molded QFN package with opening around the on-chip antenna, a corrugated metal sheet is introduced. This leads to a robust packaged radar MMIC with an on-chip antenna at 160 GHz, which provides a directed radiation pattern to boresight. Both optimized radiation patterns are well suited for the illumination of dielectric lenses, which results in a higher lens gain and a lower sidelobe level of the lens pattern compared to the standard QFN packaging. The proposed concepts are verified by measurements for the open-cavity and molded QFN packages at 160 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2846812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8384253","Antenna radiation patterns;chip scale packaging;injection molding;integrated antennas;millimeter-wave integrated circuits;patch antennas;plastic integrated circuit packaging;quad flat no leads (QFN) package;radar antennas;silicon-germanium (SiGe);surface waves;system-on-chip;transfer molding","Antenna radiation patterns;Metals;System-on-chip;Lenses;Radar antennas;Pins","","20","","27","IEEE","13 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna array is made up of wideband, wideangle long slots. The monostatic radar cross section (RCS) of the finite array is derived by windowing the aperture field distribution of the corresponding infinite case. It is shown that for oversampled apertures, the array behaves as an ideal Van Atta reflector. Therefore, the proposed solution can collect and reradiate the total power impinging on it from a remote source over a large field of view and bandwidth. The array design is presented and validated through measurements over a relative bandwidth of 24% centered at a frequency of 5.8 GHz. The array consists of four slots, each fed by eight coaxial ports. Coaxial cables are used to connect pairs of feeds in a Van Atta configuration. A bidirectional amplifier is also introduced into the Van Atta scheme to amplify the collected energy before retransmission to a possible moving user for wireless power transfer. Off-the-shelf components are used to implement the bidirection amplifier. The amplifier is matched across the bandwidth of the array and provides 5 dB gain. Monostatic RCS measurements show that the array exhibits -10 dB beamwidths of about 118° and 80° in the E- and H-planes, over the entire bandwidth. In addition, it is shown that when the array ports are terminated with matched loads, the antenna RCS is reduced by approximately -15 dB with respect to the Van Atta case.

For the practical implementation of such a hologram, we used a subwavelength metallic patch with anisotropic properties to satisfy the input admittance distribution of the hologram. In doing so, a fast numerical method, fundamentally inspired by the method of moments, is employed to calculate the input admittance of the element for all angles of incidence.

To this end, using analytical expressions for the far-fields of circular microstrip antennas, the steady-state beamforming performance of a two-element dual-polarized array with three degrees of freedom (DOFs) is studied through many Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that in the presence of randomly polarized interferers, regardless of the element pattern symmetry, the dual-polarized array can use all its DOF effectively to suppress up to three interferers and is as effective as a four-element right-handed circularly polarized (RHCP) array. It is, however, shown that if the interferers are RHCP, the dual-polarized array can use its DOF effectively only when the element patterns are asymmetric (unequal in E- and H-planes) and is ineffective in suppressing more than one interferer when the element patterns are symmetric (equal in E- and H-planes). This limitation is important in practice if the interferers are known to be RHCP and the array ground plane is small, since the patterns of microstrip antennas with small ground planes can become nearly symmetric. This finding is verified with a fabricated prototype of a two-element dual-polarized array with a small ground plane.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2851291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399889","Adaptive arrays;dual-polarized antennas;global navigation satellite system (GNSS);interference suppression;microstrip antennas","Microstrip antenna arrays;Adaptive arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Global navigation satellite system;Microstrip antennas","","5","","24","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using a vector network analyzer to generate a linearly polarized HE11 incident mode, each polarizer was individually tested to measure the rotation α and ellipticity β of the elliptically polarized reflected microwave beam as a function of the grating rotation angle. The grating polarizers were then tested together to measure the elliptical polarization as a function of the angles of the combination of the two polarizers arranged sequentially on the transmission line. The map of the ellipticity versus grating angles agreed very well with numerical simulations using high-frequency structure simulator. Numerical simulations show that up to eight combinations of rotation angles of the two grating polarizers can provide the same ellipticity but with the varying ohmic loss, thus allowing the choice of settings to minimize the ohmic loss, a necessary consideration to minimize heating effects in megawatt power level systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2851377","Fusion Energy Sciences(grant numbers:DE-FC02-93ER54186); U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AC05-00OR22725); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399867","Corrugated waveguides;Gaussian beams;gratings;microwave measurements;phase measurements;polarization","Gratings;Polarization;Transmission line measurements;Microwave theory and techniques;Numerical simulation;Mathematical model;Plasmas","","2","","37","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A modified version of the lattice network is proposed that exhibits a one-to-one mapping to the bianisotropic sheet transition conditions by incorporating ideal transformers. A possible realization of bianisotropic Huygens’ unit cells is also proposed that relies on offsetting the wire with respect to the loop in the wire/loop topology. This is followed by deriving analytical expressions for the image impedances and the corresponding transfer function of bianisotropic Huygens’ metasurfaces. Inverse analytical expressions are also derived that govern the required effective electric and magnetic responses and the magnetoelectric coupling for achieving wideband electrical transparency (symmetric case) and wideband impedance transformation (bianisotropic case) with these Huygens’ metasurface unit cells. Moreover, it is shown that these expressions can be realized with transmission-line stubs. These expressions are then used to design subwavelength thin Huygens’ metasurfaces immersed in an air gap between two dielectric media.

The impulse response of this channel exhibits a transition from early separate components followed by a diffuse reverberation tail. Under the assumption that the transmitter's (or receiver's) position and orientation are picked uniformly at random, we derive an exact expression of the mean arrival rate for a rectangular room predicted by the mirror source theory. The rate is quadratic in delay, inversely proportional to the room volume, and proportional to the product of beam coverages of the transmitter and receiver antennas. Making use of the exact formula, we characterize the onset of the diffuse tail by defining a “mixing time” as the point in time where the arrival rate exceeds one component per transmit pulse duration. We also give an approximation for the power-delay spectrum. It turns out that the power-delay spectrum is unaffected by the antenna directivity. However, Monte Carlo simulations show that antenna directivity does indeed play an important role for the distribution of instantaneous mean delay and rms delay spread.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2846785","Cooperative Research Project(grant numbers:VIRTUOSO); Intel Mobile Communications, Keysight, Telenor, Aalborg University; Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8384247","Indoor environments;radio propagation;reverberation;room electromagnetics","Delays;Directive antennas;Mirrors;Receivers;Antenna measurements;Solids","","18","","50","IEEE","13 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The simulation method is developed, which considers bistatic layout, ionospheric propagation, sea surface propagation, and radio noise. The echo characteristics by sweep frequency detection are simulated and analyzed. Using the newly developed hybrid sky-surface wave experimental system, the experimental results by sweep frequency detection are first achieved in China and abroad, which are consistent with the theoretical analysis, and the validity of the simulation is verified. Then, the characteristics of first-order sea clutter in different azimuths are theoretically and experimentally analyzed, and it is found that the bistatic layout and ionosphere play a significant role in the Doppler broadening and path distribution of the sea clutter. Finally, the experimental results by joint sweep and fixed frequency detections are analyzed. The echo characteristics are extremely complex with frequency. Specifically, owing to multimode echoes overlap, the spread of the sea clutter and ionospheric direct wave signals would seriously affect ship target detection in part of the operating frequency band.

Based on the transmission-line model, the radiation patterns of TM10 mode of the MPA loaded with shorting pins and slots are at first deeply investigated. The results demonstrate that the E-plane sidelobe could be gradually reduced by lowering the resonant frequency of TM10 mode (f10) less than two times of the fundamental frequency (f0). After that, the two adjacent TM10 and TM12 modes of the MPA are relocated to resonate in proximity to each other for bandwidth improvement and sidelobe reduction. By inserting the shorting pins underneath the radiating patch, f10 is progressively pushed up with a slight effect on that of TM12 mode (f12). Then, the patch width is enlarged with the parallel slots etched out on it to move f12 closely to f10. Moreover, a narrow slot is etched at the center of the patch for good impedance matching. With these arrangements, f10/f0 can be decreased dramatically to about 1.27. Finally, the antenna prototype is fabricated and measured. Experimental results show that the impedance bandwidth of the MPA is tremendously extended to about 10%, while keeping a low profile of 0.039 free-space wavelength.

The reactance variations are then physically realized by modulating the thickness of a grounded dielectric slab. This in turn is modeled in a full-wave 3-D simulator (CST). Aspects of the feed design for the 2-D and 3-D models are addressed to minimize contamination of the radiation pattern by direct radiation from the source. The resulting scan angles and beamwidths predicted by the CST model are found to agree with the 2-D IBC-MoM.

When illuminated by incident plane waves arriving from not just one but numerous azimuth angles, the simulated design displays two clear focal spots toward all directions, thereby exhibiting rotational symmetry which facilitates beam switching and scanning. How such circular patch elements compare with square ones is also investigated in terms of the range over which refractive indices can be synthesized as well as the bandwidths of both focal points produced by DF-GLLs composed of patches bearing those two shapes. When operated as a radiating antenna instead, for which excitation source feeds are placed at the two focal spots aligned along the azimuth angle pertaining to that intended beam direction, strong directivities toward all directions are achieved as simulated radiation patterns show. A prototype of the design was also manufactured and measurement results agree well with predictions by simulations, particularly in terms of realizing two distinct focal points toward several azimuth directions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2845550","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-3017-F-009-001); Ministry of Education in Taiwan through the Center for mmWave Smart Radar Systems and Technologies under the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8376010","Double-focus;Luneburg lens;metasurface","Lenses;Dispersion;Surface waves;Optical surface waves;Azimuth;Surface impedance;Dielectrics","","33","","22","IEEE","8 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The structure comprises a meandered pattern engraved on a flexible dielectric substrate, where the liquid metal [eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn)] adopts the geometry of the microfluidic channels. The novelty of the proposed design lies in its multifunctional response, switching from all-pass to bandpass/bandstop characteristic, depending on whether EGaIn is injected in the microchannels. The liquid-metal-filled structure, being asymmetric in nature, selectively realizes bandpass operation for a specific polarization, whereas bandstop response is observed under orthogonal polarization. Furthermore, the design exhibits miniaturization performance during bandpass response (at 1.37 GHz), corresponding to unit cell dimensions of 0.059λ0 × 0.059λ0. The structure was analyzed through the derivation of equivalent circuit models and several parametric variations. Finally, the proposed multifunctional FSS was fabricated by laser etching, and the filter parameters were experimentally verified under normal as well as oblique incidence.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2851455","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2017R1A2B3003856); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399891","Frequency-selective surface (FSS);liquid metal;miniaturization;multifunction;reconfigurable structures","Metals;Frequency selective surfaces;Magnetic liquids;Substrates;Integrated circuit modeling;Microfluidics","","60","","30","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The structures are discretized using the higher order polynomial basis functions, whose orders are adaptively adjusted for accurately modeling current distributions in this kind of strong near-field coupling and resonance problems. Moreover, the integral equations for the apertures involving the waveguide ports, each of which is terminated by a semi-infinite waveguide, are established according to Schelkunoff's equivalence principle and the boundary conditions. Because the free-space Green's function as well as the spatial discretization-based basis functions cannot be applied to semi-infinite waveguides, we employ waveguide eigenfunctions as the basis functions for the outer surface of an aperture. These coupled integral equations are then solved numerically using the method of moments accelerated by the parallel computing techniques.
