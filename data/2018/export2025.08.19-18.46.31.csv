Krairiksh","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA; Department of Electronics, Polytechnic of Turin, Turin, Italy; Department of Electromagnetics, CentraleSupelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; Department of Telecommunication Engineering, King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Ladkrabang, Thailand",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"29 Nov 2018","2018","66","12","6470","6475","In his seminal article [1], Gabor observed that Communication theory has up to now been developed mainly on mathematical lines, taking for granted the physical significance of the quantities which figure in its formalism. But communication is the transmission of physical effects from one system to another, hence communication theory should be considered as a branch of physics. Thus it is necessary to embody in its foundations such fundamental physical data as the quantum of action, and the discreteness of electric charges $\ldots$  We observe first that all electric signals are conveyed by radiation. Even if lines or cables are used in the transmission, by the Maxwell-Poynting theory the energy can be located in empty space. Hence we can apply to our problem the well known results of the theory of radiation. The point here is that in the design of the physical layer one has to apply other concepts besides the principles of communication theory. More recently, this point was further investigated by Ivrlac and Nossek [2], [3], where they state that Electromagnetic field theory provides the physics of radio communications, while information theory approaches the problem from a purely mathematical point of view. While there is a law of conservation of energy in physics, there is no such law in information theory. Consequently, when, in information theory, reference is made (as it frequently is) to terms like energy, power, noise, or antennas, it is by no means guaranteed that their use is consistent with the physics of the communication system. Information theory serves well as the mathematical theory of communication. However, it contains no provision that makes sure its theorems are consistent with the physical laws that govern any existing realization of a communication system. Therefore, it may not be surprising that applications of information theory or signal processing, as currently practiced, easily turn out to be inconsistent with fundamental principles of physics, such as the law of conservation of energy. Ivrlac and Nossek further elaborate [3] that there exist a number of fundamental principles in physics which can be stated as conservation laws, meaning that there are quantities which can be calculated for a physical system at one time, and when recalculated at a later time come out the same [4]. They further illustrate that an example is the law of conservation of energy $\ldots$  The movement of the planets around the sun can be obtained solely by following the implications of the laws of conservation of energy and angular momentum [5]. Moreover, the conservation laws are also deep principles for they relate to symmetry in physics [6]. For instance, conservation of energy implies that the laws of Nature are time-invariant, and vice versa. Also, in signal processing and information theory, the concept of energy is a prominent one. It appears as the energy required to transfer one bit of information, or one symbol of the signal alphabet, or sometimes in form of transmit power, i.e., the rate at which energy must be supplied per unit of time to maintain communication. Yet, interestingly, the fact that energy is conserved, which is of such fundamental importance in physics, apparently plays no role in standard textbooks on information theory [7], signal processing [8], communication theory [9] or signal theory [10]. The authors are also not aware of any research work in these areas where the remarkable fact that energy is conserved is explored or discussed. The reason for this strange absence of conservation laws in signal processing, information theory and related disciplines seems to be related to inputs and outputs which are each described by single variables, instead of by a pair of conjugated variables, like position and momentum in Hamiltonian mechanics [6], or voltage and current in circuit theory [11]. Therefore, to address the development of the physical layer adequately and to ensure that systems perform according to design criteria, it is necessary to merge the principles of electromagnetics, which are primarily related to antennas and maximum power transfer, to the issues of channel capacity and how it can be quantified using the principles of physics and the radiation efficiency of antennas rather than the use of the maximum power transfer theorem [12].","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2881496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8552718","","Special issues and sections;Radiowave propagation;Electromagnetics;Wireless communication;Physics;Mathematical model;Propagation losses","","4","","0","IEEE","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is in part driven by the technology and science around the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and leads to progressively higher receiver sensitivities. Consequently, these new generation radio telescopes are more susceptible to radio frequency interference. The situation may be further aggravated when dishes are deployed in a compact fashion since this can result in a complex multipath environment. Focusing on the 64-dish SKA precursor, MeerKAT, multipath effects in the core area comprising 44 dishes of 13.5 m diameter in a 1 km radius are investigated. Due to complexity of the environment, empirical models offer limited benefit, and hence, numerical modeling becomes a compelling solution. We thus present a deterministic propagation model exploiting the method of moments for antenna and real ground modeling and physical optics for representing scattering from metallic surfaces. In this way, the MeerKAT core was reproduced computationally and attenuation maps were produced revealing high- and low-risk regions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2804621","South African SKA Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8288647","Electromagnetic (EM) interference;MeerKAT;propagation losses;radio astronomy;radiowave propagation","Numerical models;Computational modeling;Gain;Method of moments;Receiving antennas;Propagation losses","","3","","38","IEEE","9 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The VPE method is applied to analyze the propagation for a short distance from the transmitter. Subsequently, with the fields generated using VPE, a rectangular waveguide model of the tunnel is extracted, leading to rapid, analytical computation of fields over arbitrarily long distances. This hybrid model takes into account realistic tunnel geometries and antenna radiation patterns while ensuring significant computational savings.

To solve this problem, we propose an ASE correction method for PE, where the ASE is derived using the iteration idea of SSFT. On the basis of derivation results, the ASE is modeled based on propagation elevation angle distribution, which is estimated by ray tracing differential form. The performance of the PE ASE (PEASE) correction method is then demonstrated by several examples, where one example uses measured radar sea clutter data from Huanghai Sea, China. The results show that the PEASE correction method has better calculation accuracy. In addition, we provide some suggestions by analyzing the sensitivity of ASE resulting from various parameters in a standard and nonstandard atmosphere, respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2864327","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271104); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8429933","Parabolic equation (PE) method;PE accumulated split error (PEASE) correction method;slip-step Fourier transform (SSFT);tropospheric radio propagation characteristics","Mathematical model;Atmospheric modeling;Ray tracing;Atmospheric measurements;Standards;Refractive index","","1","","20","IEEE","8 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulated results are compared to data obtained from measurement on a real blade, in two experiments involving antennas transmitting both from outside near the blade tip and from inside the blade. In the first experiment, when the wave is propagated along the entire blade and received near the blade root, the differences between the simulation and the measurement are found in pulse magnitudes within 3 dB and in delay within 1.5 ns. In the second experiment, the emitted waves are studied at only 10 m distance, but at higher elevations, and the error reaches 6 dB in magnitude and 1.9 ns in delay. Possible reasons for observed discrepancies between the simulations and the measurements are briefly discussed.

Afterward, the NFF column subarrays become the elements of a 1-D horizontal collinearly located array to radiate horizontally NFF multiple beams. The horizontal NFF beamforming network is implemented by extending the basic concept of conventional Rotman lens beamformer for directional NFF multibeam applications. Thus, three feeding points are selected to determine the lens's profile such that the produced phases via the modified Rotman lens can be used to feed a planar array to radiate three NFF beams when the lens is excited at the three selected points, respectively. This antenna set is realized at 2.45 GHz for radio frequency identification applications to demonstrate the implementation concept.

Moreover, the effective permittivity of the meteorological environment is given and then the propagation attenuation in the meteorological environment can be estimated. In this way, the wave propagation of tunnels in the complex meteorological environment can be modeled by updating the refractive index for PE.

This fragmented approach does not exploit available efficiencies when planning and deploying communication systems. In an attempt to integrate the two areas, we harness the understanding of the underlying physics of electromagnetic propagation to enhance the robustness of network protocol design by deriving physics-based network-level performance metrics. We use ray-tracing and parabolic equation models of 2.4 GHz propagation along tunnel and open-air sections of London Underground to evaluate the performance of a communications-based train control system. For comparison, we consider existing path loss models for tunnel environments and investigate whether they can provide sufficient accuracy to be used for network protocol design. We show that physics-based models lead to reliable predictions at the network level, similar in fidelity to using measured data and unlike using simplified channel models of the path loss exponent type.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2876649","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8496772","Channel models;finite difference methods;network protocol design;radio propagation;ray tracing","Ray tracing;Antennas;Loss measurement;Mathematical model;Protocols;Geometry;Atmospheric modeling","","24","","42","IEEE","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The high-frequency diffraction coefficients are obtained by performing uniform asymptotic evaluations of the radiation integrals resulting from the physical optics approximation of the electric and magnetic equivalent surface currents located on the inner and outer faces of the wedge. The final expressions are in closed form and contain the standard transition function of the uniform theory of diffraction and the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients related to the geometrical optics propagation mechanisms. Moreover, they allow a simple physical interpretation of each contribution and they are easy to use and to implement in a computer code. The knowledge of such diffraction coefficients in the frequency domain permits to apply the inverse Laplace transform to obtain the time-domain counterparts, which enable the evaluation of the transient diffracted field originated by an arbitrary function plane wave.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2876602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8494796","Diffraction;frequency domain (FD);propagation;time domain (TD);wedge","Diffraction;Dielectric losses;Surface waves;Optical surface waves;Reflection;Antennas","","17","","26","IEEE","17 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to eliminate the limitations of the reception spheres in the traditional unidirectional shooting and bouncing rays (SBR) method, both the transmitter and receiver are used for ray launching. The resulting rays are captured on an interaction surface, which is much more flexible in terms of size and shape than a reception sphere. The transfer function between two antennas is obtained by evaluating the reciprocity integral on this interaction surface by a specifically designed numerical integration procedure. It is shown that the new method has two advantages compared to the traditional unidirectional ray tracing. First, flexible interaction surfaces help to retain the accuracy in large geometries where the traditional unidirectional SBR fails due to reception spheres being limited in size and being missed by the rays. Second, explicit computation of single and multiple diffraction effects by the uniform theory of diffraction can be avoided and replaced by a physical optics like integration over the reciprocity interaction surface. Numerical results demonstrate the capabilities and advantages of the new approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2876680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8496863","Edge diffraction;graphical processing unit (GPU);oscillatory integral;ray tracing;reciprocity;shooting and bouncing rays (SBR)","Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Ray tracing;Diffraction;Antenna theory;Couplings;Optical surface waves","","16","","32","IEEE","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown starting with the Okumura et al.'s paper on propagation measurements and other available published experimental data that they all exhibit that the electric field varies as ρ-1.5 within a cellular radius of a few kilometers, where ρ is the radial distance of the receiving antenna from the transmitting one. This decay in the fields is equivalent to a propagation loss of -9 dB/octave or -30 dB for a decade of the distance. This value is independent of the nature of the ground, whether it be composed of rural, urban, suburban, or water. This is the first time it is stated that the propagation path loss due to the presence of ground generates a path loss of 90 dB when the signals travel a distance of 1 km. This value is rather large when compared to a loss of 30-50 dB produced by buildings, trees, and similar artifacts. Therefore, the experimental data indicate that the effect of trees and buildings have a secondary influence on the decay of the electric field with distance, the dominant one is the propagation loss over an imperfect ground. Contemporary propagation models do not acknowledge this fact. Outside the cellular radius of a few kilometers, the path loss appears to be 12 dB/octave or 40 dB/decade of distance. In a companion paper, it will be demonstrated that the values for the path loss can be explained from an analytical standpoint without taking recourse to statistics which involves a lot of assumptions on the functional variation of the variables of interest.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2878108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8509598","Cellular radio wave propagation;experimental data for radio waves;path-loss exponent","Propagation losses;Antenna measurements;Base stations;Loss measurement;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Urban areas","","9","","16","IEEE","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A theoretical macro model based on the classical Sommerfeld formulation can duplicate various experimental data including that of Okumura et al. carried out in 1968. It is important to point out that there are also many statistical models but they do not conform to the results of the available experimental data. Specifically, there are separate path loss propagation models available in the literature for waves traveling in urban, suburban, rural environments, and the like. However, no such distinction is made in the results obtained from the theoretical analysis and measured experimental data. Based on the analysis using the macro model developed after Sommerfeld's classic century-old analytical formulation, one can also explain the origin of slow fading which is due to the interference between the direct wave from the base station antenna and the ground wave emanating from the reflections of the direct wave and occurs only in the near field of the transmitting antenna. The so-called height gain occurs in the far field of a base station antenna deployment which falls generally outside the cell of interest, while in the near field, within the cell, there is a height loss of the field strength for observation points near the ground. A physical realization of the propagation mechanism is illustrated through Vander Pol's exact transformation of the Sommerfeld integrals for the potential to a spatial semiinfinite volume integral and thus illustrates why buildings, trees, and the like have little effects on the propagation mechanism.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2878366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8510858","Analysis of Wire Antennas and Scatterers (AWAS);cellular radio wave propagation;experimental data for radio waves;path loss exponent;Schelkunoff formulation;Sommerfeld formulation","Reflection coefficient;Data models;Propagation losses;Earth;Antennas;Wireless communication","","6","","23","IEEE","26 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
