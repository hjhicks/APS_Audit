The proposed antenna consists of a reconfigurable radiator and a switchable feeding network. The radiator combines two individual QHAs in a cuboid, which can be alternatively activated. The feeding network provides switchable quadrature excitations to the radiator. By controlling the p-i-n diodes on the radiator and the feeding network, four working states including both polarization and pattern agilities are achieved. The polarization of the antenna can be switched between two orthogonal circular polarizations, and the radiation pattern can be changed between broadside and backfire modes. A prototype designed to operate at 0.9 GHz band is developed and measured. The measured results validated that the antenna achieved the four working states with stable wide-beam radiation patterns. Moreover, the proposed antenna obtained wide impedance and axial-ratio bandwidths (36.2% and 22%, respectively) in a compact size (0.26λ0 × 0.26λ0 × 0.25λ0).

For designing the proposed rectenna, first a differentially fed multiband slot antenna that works as the front-end receiving unit is designed, fabricated, and tested to check its performance. It is observed that a peak antenna gain of 7, 5.5, and 9.2 dBi is achieved at 2, 2.5, and 3.5 GHz, respectively.

The technique avoids the need for discretization of the horn antenna structure into several cascaded sections or the imposition of unknown currents over the entire horn surface, thus reducing the computational burden significantly. The aperture fields of the conical horn are investigated for varying horn lengths. Reflection effects at the aperture is found to be minimal for horn lengths over 5λ, corresponding to a horn aperture diameter of more than 2λ. Analytical expressions used to represent the aperture fields over the conical cap at the aperture are provided from which the radiation fields are derived to characterize the aperture radiation. It is observed that the loop excitation can be appropriately located relative to the horn apex to couple to appropriate modes to generate broadside or monopole-like pattern characteristics. Also, in addition to the simplicity of the feed configuration, the loop position can be properly selected to couple to multiple modes that has a significant impact on the pattern directivity and sidelobe levels.

With the simple design procedure, the technique is practical and effective for the open-stopband suppression for various periodic leaky-wave antennas. Two periodic leaky-wave antennas with the technique are demonstrated. The first one is a new developed substrate-integrated waveguide antenna with two nonidentical transverse slots per unit cell. The antenna has a wide scanning range from the backward endfire to the forward direction and does not suffer from blind scanning points at endfires (if it is placed on an infinite ground plane). The antenna is theoretically investigated. The simulation and measured results are consistent with the theoretical results. The second one is a microstrip combline leaky-wave antenna, in which each unit cell contains two nonidentical open-ended stubs.

The required reflector aperture is synthesized using a family of confocal parabolic sections, each of which scatters in phase to provide a focused beam in the far field. The parabolic sections provide a distinct advantage over the conventional Fresnel zone plate (FZP) antenna, since the radiation is inherently unidirectional. Furthermore, the metal-only structure avoids the need for dielectric characterization, which is essential for reflectarrays. Using this technique, it is possible to achieve depths of the order of one wavelength while ensuring high efficiencies. Starting from a symmetric stepped reflector synthesis, two distinct approaches to synthesize offset stepped reflectors are explored in this paper. We highlight several interesting tradeoffs between electromagnetic performance and mechanical complexity that arise for each of these approaches. A thorough analysis of the frequency performance of stepped parabolic reflectors is also presented. Comprehensive simulations using both physical optics and multilevel fast multipole method validate our theoretical predictions. The formulations presented in this paper are especially relevant at mmWave frequencies and beyond, which has attracted significant interest for modern technologies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2821694","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8329408","Aperture antennas;Fresnel zone plate (FZP) antenna;high efficiency;low-profile antennas;metal-only reflectors;mmWaves;offset stepped reflector;stepped parabolic reflectors","Geometry;Aperture antennas;Optical surface waves;Hafnium compounds","","20","","45","IEEE","2 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A rigorous proof for such equivalence is provided. Lumped loads are very useful for the manipulation of certain modes, and in this paper, the relationship between the loads for an aperture and its complementary plate is built.

First, the volume equivalence principle is used to replace the BOR with volume electric and magnetic current densities. Requisite volume integral equations (VIEs) are, then, derived with the electric and magnetic flux densities inside the BOR being the unknown quantities. Finally, the VIEs are solved by Galerkin's method of moments. This is done by expanding the unknown flux densities in terms of appropriate basis functions compatible with the problem symmetry, and hence, reducing the integral equations to a matrix equation. The formation of the resultant matrix equation is elucidated in detail, whereby it is shown that the computation burden is remarkably reduced as no double volumetric-type integrals are to be computed.

Our approach is a combination of a level set method and a linearized approach and has a regularization term for stability during level set iterations. We provide a detailed analysis of the method and demonstrate its applicability on synthetically generated data for 2-D microwave imaging. Different objects chosen to represent realistic features are considered to evaluate the performance. This approach is extended to multiple materials. The reconstructed images indicate that the method can produce accurate object localization, and shape and size identification.

The cause of the discontinuities in DT is in the implementation of the stationary phase solution for evaluating the spectral integral. The usual approach is to make a far-field approximation assuming that the depth is large. However, this is not appropriate for near-field imaging. UDT overcomes this issue by choosing the correct large asymptotic parameter in the exponent of the spectral integrand. In this paper, the original 2-D scalar UDT algorithm is extended to a fully vector 3-D solution involving the dyadic Green's function for the layered media, the polarization of the gain pattern of the probe antenna, and the stationary phase evaluation of a 2-D spectral integral. The 3-D UDT is demonstrated to provide smoothly continuous images, and like the conventional DT, the fast Fourier transform is implemented to generate images in real time. 3-D numerical simulations and experimental results are presented to verify the accuracy and efficacy of the 3-D UDT algorithm.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2819897","Chinese Academy of Sciences Scholarship Program; PaneraTech, Inc., a member of the NSF Connection One Consortium; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8325515","Green’s function methods;ground penetrating radar (GPR);image generation;microwave imaging;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);tomography","Nonhomogeneous media;Reflection;Electric fields;Approximation algorithms;Tomography","","15","","38","IEEE","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to improve the sound source localization performance in actual environment, a fast and robust radial basis function (RBF) neural network based on global K-means clustering with adaptive selection radius is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, an adaptive selection radius is calculated according to the population density sampling method to remove unnecessary points around cluster centers during the global K-means clustering; thus, compared with the conventional neural network, a fast optimization of hidden layer neuron parameters can be achieved. Afterward, the RBF neural network is trained to locate the sound source by solving nonlinear equations of the time difference of arrival and sound source location. Because of the adoption of adaptive selection radius in global K-means clustering, the proposed method can provide desirable performance with low computational complexity.

A set of shorting pins are loaded in circular contours underneath the circular patch to substantially increase the resonant frequency of TM11 mode, and the radiation gain in lower band can be hence effectively enhanced due to the enlarged patch size at resonance. Meanwhile, a narrow slot is introduced to the center of patch, in order to interrupt the out-of-phase current of TM12 mode on patch for sidelobe reduction. As the electric current distribution on patch is significantly reshaped by the slot, the antennas act like a full-wave dipole in this case, so both high gain and low sidelobe level are realized in upper band. Besides, by properly adjusting the shorting positions of pins and length of slot, the antenna can be well matched in the desired 3.6 and 5.9 GHz wireless local area network bands. Simulated and measured results show that at least 10 dBi realized gain can be obtained in both the lower and upper bands, and the patterns in the two bands show agreeable beamwidths.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2819704","National Natural Science Foundation of China through General Program(grant numbers:61571468); University of Macau through Multi-Year Research(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00007-FST); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund through FDCT Research(grant numbers:091/2016/A2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8325504","Dual bands;high gain;shorting pins;sidelobe reduction","Patch antennas;Pins;Dual band;Loading;Resonant frequency;Current distribution","","46","","31","IEEE","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is especially suited for near-field characterization of high-gain millimeter- and submillimeter-wave antennas in which phase acquisition is a difficult task, requiring complex and expensive instrumentation and steady conditions. The phase of the field is retrieved at each point of the acquisition surface for a set of frequencies, and, consequently, the technique can be applied independently of the acquisition geometry. Validation examples are presented in the W-band.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2819881","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación of Spain/FEDER(grant numbers:PortEMVision-TEC2014-55290-JIN); Gobierno del Principado de Asturias through the PCTI/FEDER-FSE 2013-2017(grant numbers:GRUPIN14-114); Ayudas Fundación BBVA a Investigadores y Creadores Culturales; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8325449","Amplitude-only;broadband;calibration;diagnostics;off-axis holography;phaseless","Broadband antennas;Antenna measurements;Holography;Calibration;Broadband communication;Phase measurement","","7","","18","IEEE","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
