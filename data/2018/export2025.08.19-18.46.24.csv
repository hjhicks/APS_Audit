The decoupling mechanism applied in here is to change the electrical length of the radiators to manipulate the radiation pattern for obtaining pattern diversity and good isolation simultaneously. The design mechanism and procedures for realizing pattern diversity are presented. To validate the proposed method, a two-element monopole antenna array with inverted-L elements is initially studied with the isolation better than 20 dB. Next, a four-element MIMO antenna utilizing two different types of monopole elements is proposed to further verify the feasibility of the proposed decoupling method. Finally, an eight-element MIMO antenna operating at 3.5 GHz is implemented with a compact total size of 40 × 100 mm2, and the measured isolations between two elements are better than 15 dB.

A compact element antenna is proposed with switchable ports for implementing the spatial phase shift technique, which is composed of a square driven patch, two sets of perturbation segments connected to the driven patch via p-i-n diodes for polarization diversity, a parasitic patch, and three switchable feeding probes integrated with a designed single-pole triple-throw switch. For circular polarized waves, individual excitation at the three feeding probes can obtain a 90° or 180° phase difference because of the spatial relative position between the feeding probes. The radiation beam and polarization of the  $2{\times} 2$  array antenna can be dynamically reconfigured among nine beams and dual-circular polarization modes by properly switching these feeding probes and perturbation segments. In addition, the 3 dB axial-ratio bandwidths are effectively enhanced by using the spatial phase shift technique. To validate the proposed concept, a prototype operating at 4.8 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured.

One λ/4 resonator and one λ/2 resonator are introduced and coupled in proximity to two orthogonal points of a square patch radiator to excite two orthogonal modes. These two resonators not only function as impedance matching elements to achieve equal magnitude of two orthogonal modes in a wide frequency band but also provide the required 90° phase difference. In this way, two minima in the AR response appear, resulting in extended AR bandwidth. The wideband design of the antenna is carried out based on the equivalent circuit model, where the patch radiator is treated as a conductance, inductance, and capacitance parallel resonator. In particular, the feeding network and the patch are jointly considered as a three-port network for synthesis design. By mapping the radiated far field to the magnitude and phase on the radiation conductance in the circuit model, the AR response of the antenna becomes predictable in a straightforward manner.

A novel concept of decomposing the antenna into two elements, which are independently coupled to two orthogonal ground modes for far-field radiation, is proposed through a theoretical analysis based on characteristic mode theory. The proposed dual-element antenna is comprised a loop-type element and monopole-type element, where one element is directly fed and the other resonates parasitically.

The antenna aperture occupies a cubical volume with electrical dimensions of  $0.0107 \lambda _{0} \times 0.0107 \lambda _{0} \times 0.0033 \lambda _{0}$ , where  $\lambda _{0}$  is the free-space wavelength at its lowest frequency of operation and is used for DF over a 100 : 1 bandwidth. The antenna array is composed of four hexagonal-cone-shaped monopoles on a finite ground plane. The antennas are loaded with top hats and exploit the near-field parasitic elements to obtain the realized gain values close to the theoretical limits over their entire frequency band of operation. A simple, yet robust null-steering technique is used both on its own and also in conjunction with the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, as signal-processing methods, to detect the direction of arrival of the wave over the entire 100 : 1 bandwidth. A scaled prototype of the antenna was fabricated and used to perform DF experiments in the field in the VHF-UHF band. The DF system demonstrates azimuthal bearing accuracies comparable to the Cramer–Rao-Lower-Bound values calculated for the measured received signal-to-noise ratios over the whole frequency range. The DF performance of the full-scale version of this antenna, when mounted on a representative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is also examined through computer simulations.

However, current studies mainly pay attention to improve the performance of the main lobe of the MS antenna, leaving the sidelobe unexplored although it is also essential in some practical applications. In this paper, several phaseand amplitude-control reflected MSs have been proposed to simultaneously manipulate the antenna's main lobe and sidelobes. The MSs consist of modified I-shaped particles which can independently manipulate the phases and amplitudes of the cross-polarization waves by changing the split size and orientation, respectively. A focusing phase distribution and different Taylor amplitude distributions have been fixed on the MSs. By illuminating the MSs with a self-made antenna, we have successfully designed four MS antennas. For the first antenna, we solely pay attention to improve the main lobe and achieve a high gain of 20.7 dB at 10 GHz. For the other three antennas, we also aim to manipulate their sidelobes. The resultant sidelobe levels (SLLs) are about -25 dB in the xoz plane for the second antenna, -29 dB in the yoz plane for the third antenna, and both of the former two characteristics for the fourth antenna. Compared with the first MS antenna, the last three antennas suffer from gain reductions of 2, 1.7, and 3 dB, respectively. These proposed MS antennas provide a new way to manipulate both main-lobe levels and SLLs and also greatly promote the integration of MSs and antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2858181","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61372034,61501499,61701527); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8417934","Main lobe and sidelobe;metasurface (MS) antennas;phase and amplitude control;sidelobe level (SLL)","Focusing;Gain;Vivaldi antennas;Reflection;Feeds;Antenna radiation patterns","","169","","33","IEEE","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To the authors' best knowledge, it is the first time that the exact values of QT with respect to the high-loss tissue and embedded depth are studied and applied to design an implantable MPA. As the calculated QT is confirmed in simulation, one can understand that an implantable MPA is actually a lossy resonator with extremely low QT. As such, CP radiation can be achieved by enlarging its truncated area to appropriately separate two degenerate modes in such high-loss environment. The designed implantable MPA is then exhibited to achieve a broad impedance bandwidth, wide 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth and beamwidth, and high realized gain at 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical band.

It is based on differential contributions, which takes advantage of the fact that when an array is optimized, each element is analyzed independently of the rest. Thus, the computation of the gradient of the cost function, which is typically the most time-consuming operation of the algorithm, can be accelerated. A time cost study is presented and the technique is implemented, as an example, in the generalized intersection approach algorithm for array optimization in near and far fields. Several syntheses are performed to assess the improvement of this technique.

An algorithm to generate reference-shaped beams in the near-field region with controllable sidelobe levels is first proposed. Then, the multitask BC is modified and generalized to synthesize a near-field sparse array radiating a desired near-field pattern with the co-polarization component. After that, a postprocessing of the final array excitation is employed to put constraints on the minimum element spacing to make the sparse layout practicable. The degradation of the near-field pattern is mitigated through reestimating the array excitation by a convex optimization. Three numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method with more than 50% of elements saved compared to the uniformly distributed layout.

The connection offers many theoretical and practical advantages not immediately obvious from any PML reconstructions. For example, the analysis shows that the reflection-free of PML boundaries is composed of the superposition of one Dirichlet and one Neumann solution acting out of phase constituents. In fact, it uncovers that the existing PML solutions are readily obtained from the projection of the well-understood 1-D Robin impedance-matched wave equations. The projection hence not only explains how the PML split fields fundamentally come about but also that the PML implicitly uses only an orthogonal projection. Naturally, we further extend the construction to include nonorthogonal decomposition. Local-to-global coordinate transformation is introduced to give a general nonreflecting boundary value solution valid for planar orientations not aligned with the Cartesian coordinates. Nonorthogonal generalizations also make it geometrically explicit as to what causes an incorrect PML problem that can arise from mediums lacking orthogonal symmetry invariant terminations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2862342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424172","Boundary value problems;discontinuity;finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","Antennas;Impedance;Propagation;Electromagnetic waveguides;Dispersion;Geometry;Nonhomogeneous media","","2","","26","IEEE","1 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method applies the fast inverse Laplace transform to determine the time-domain impulse responses of the complex permittivity function and utilizes Prony's method to determine the infinite impulse response representation in the z-domain. The FDTD formulation for the update of the electric field is then directly derived by using the z-transformation. The validity of the method is demonstrated by the 3-D analyses of a homogeneous dielectric sphere and a multilayer sphere illuminated by an EM pulse. It is demonstrated that the numerical results of induced electric field distributions inside the spheres are in good agreement with those derived from Mie's theory over a broad frequency range, proving the validity of the proposed method.

However, the proposed method only requires the solution of the impedance matrix equation of the original structure. Any small modification of the original object is handled into two steps: first by subtracting a small part from the original structure and then by adding a small part to the rest-structure. Both of these steps can be efficiently computed by using the partitioned-inverse and Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formulas with the solution of the original structure. When the structure is modified, the proposed method only requires additional operations whose computational burden is  $O(N^{2})$ , as opposed to  $O(N^{3})$ , where  ${N}$  is the number of unknowns in the original structure.

Therefore, a reliable rain attenuation prediction model is necessary for the design of these systems. Recently, two anomalous behaviors have been reported in existing rain attenuation prediction models. First, predicted rain attenuation results from many models vary nonmonotonically with elevation angles. Second, the rain attenuation predicted by the ITU-R model varies nonmonotonically with a percentage of time or rain rate in low latitudes (between 36° S and 36° N) and low elevation angles (below 25°). To tackle these problems and improve the prediction accuracy, a new rain attenuation model is developed based on the exponential rain cell profile, and a concept of rain rate adjustment factor is proposed.

In the past, missiles were typically assumed to be point targets, to simplify modeling and calculation of these parameters, due to the limitations of equipment measurement accuracy. However, with the improvements to missile strike accuracy, more accurate vector motion parameter estimation techniques are required. The development of such techniques is made possible by the increased precision of modern measurement equipment. This paper proposes an extended-target vector motion parameter estimation method, based on traditional point-target estimation, which uses the Doppler frequency, and phase differences due to the localized scattering center. Because flying missiles have an attitude angle, we also consider this parameter, based on the use of an extended-target model.

The contributions of this paper are: 1) physical meaning of the reduced scattered field of the NOSM is explained by showing how it approximates the contrast source values in the sampling domain for different generic and limited aperture configurations; 2) the application of the NOSM is generalized to a generic configuration and some comments are made how to reduce the computational complexity and source requirements; 3) the reciprocity of the data is accounted for to improve the performance for limited aperture measurement scenarios; and 4) finally, a useful modified indicator is obtained by relying on the physical meaning of the indicator.

The measurement performance of the system is carefully investigated with respect to accuracy and efficiency, e.g., by a comprehensive evaluation of room scattering and by laser scanner measurements. The fast irregular antenna field transformation algorithm (FIAFTA) is utilized to perform the necessary NF to far-field transformations. Due to the flexibility of FIAFTA, so-called nonredundant planar measurements become possible, which overcome the classical half-wavelength sampling requirement entailed by the fast Fourier transform-based transformation approaches. Thus, with a time-factor of about 35, accelerated planar measurement results are achieved by projecting angularly uniform sample grids on the minimum sphere around the antenna under test (AUT) onto the measurement plane, resulting in irregularly thinned planar measurement grids. The error levels between two completely independent measurements employing full and thinned grids are found at a level below -40 dB.

Those limitations prevent the image reconstruction process from being fast, which is an important requirement for urgent medical applications such as stroke detection. To cope with these limitations, significant approximations are usually implemented within the integral equations. Those approximations include considering the imaging antennas as point sources, assuming homogeneity along one of the domain's coordinate axes, and necessitating a background matching medium. These approximations result in some undesirable effects in practice such as reconstructing merely 2-D images with limited accuracy, and manufacturing problems associated with selecting a suitable background matching medium with reasonable dielectric properties. To alleviate some of the above limitations and challenges, this paper introduces a partial differential equation framework for microwave tomography established on the wave and the third Maxwell equations. The proposed method is independent of Green's function and its corresponding limitations. Thus, it can reconstruct 3-D images in a faster manner, particularly in emergency scenarios such as stroke detection where time is life.

The wireless cable method, which can achieve cable connection functionality without actual radio frequency cable connections, is a promising alternative. To date, the wireless method has been only discussed for 2 × 2 MIMO terminals in the literature. However, the algorithm is not directly applicable for high-order MIMO terminals, due to the high computation complexity to determine the calibration matrix and high system cost to implement the calibration matrix. In this paper, an efficient particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to determine the calibration matrix for high-order MIMO systems. Furthermore, a novel implementation of the calibration matrix in the radio channel emulator is proposed, which can significantly reduce the system cost. To validate the proposed algorithm, two MIMO mockups, each equipped with four antennas, were measured in an anechoic chamber.

Thereafter, a decoding process is applied to retrieve the antenna signals necessary to compute the basic observables of an interferometer, namely complex visibilities.

Herein, a generalized visibility equation is given while considering M antennas associated with N receivers. Then, a linear relationship between these visibility samples and the noise source brightness temperature is established, and a regularization method is applied to compute the source image.

Initially, the radiated field of a conventional SPA is theoretically investigated. It is demonstrated that its high cross-pol of the H-plane radiation patterns can be reduced by introducing a pair of shorting walls underneath the nonradiating edges of the SPA. Then, the width of the radiating patch is progressively enlarged so as to decrease the resonant frequency of TM1/2,2 mode. After that, an array of six shorting pins is loaded underneath the patch radiator toward pushing up the resonant frequency of TM1/2,0 mode. In addition, the linear Slots 1 and 2 are cut on the rectangular patch to reduce the resonant frequency of TM3/2,0 mode and achieve a good impedance matching, respectively. With these arrangements, all of these three radiative modes are reallocated in proximity to each other, leading to the formulation of the improved SPA with low profile, wide-bandwidth, and low cross-pol performances. Finally, the proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. The measured results show that its impedance bandwidth is extended up to about 26.2% under triple-mode resonance.

In other words, unlike the previous error control schemes which are valid only for high-frequency problems, the proposed scheme can be used to control the error across both low- and high-frequency problems. Optimum truncation numbers and machine precisions are calculated for a wide range of box sizes and desired relative error thresholds with the proposed error control scheme. The results are compared with the previously available methods and numerical surveys.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2854405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8408812","Diagonalization;error analysis;fast multipole method (FMM);low-frequency breakdown;multiple-precision arithmetic (MPA)","Error correction;Green's function methods;MLFMA;Harmonic analysis;Electric breakdown;Complexity theory;Optimized production technology","","11","","21","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two LMS link scenarios in an urban pedestrian environment are examined. In the first one, the transmitter was located at the top of a tall building and in the second one, on an airship. The third-order scattering model is utilized to statistically characterize the measured channels, and the results reveal that the model provides an excellent fit to the LMS composite fading amplitude in the line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS scenarios. For this generic radio channel, asymptotic expressions for the theoretical probability density function and the cumulative distribution function are derived. The comparison of the third-order scattering model with existing LMS ones showed that it provides better overall accuracy together with a physical interpretation of the propagation mechanisms involved.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2854410","University of Piraeus Research Center (UPRC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8408839","Channel characterization and modeling;dual-polarized;multiple-scattering;multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) satellite measurements","Scattering;MIMO communication;Buildings;Antennas;Satellite broadcasting;Fading channels;Roads","","5","","18","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The interface between two semi-infinite dissimilar half-spaces is considered as an infinite aperture, which is represented by a perturbed equivalent magnetic current. Coupled integral equations for the aperture electric field (or equivalent magnetic current) and the equivalent currents on the buried cylinder are obtained from surface equivalence principles and are solved numerically by the method of moments. Data for the electric field at the interface and far field are presented for cases of interest and are compared to the results available in the literature.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2860040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8421253","Buried object detection;electromagnetic scattering;integral equations","Dielectrics;Integral equations;Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetic separation;Scattering;Magnetic domains;Electric fields","","6","","21","IEEE","26 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
