The proposed circuit effectively describes the mechanism of feeding the antenna by the semiconductor when this latter is illuminated by a laser operating in a pulsed mode. Starting from the classical continuity equation, which models the free carriers' density with respect to the laser power pump and the semiconductor features, a Norton equivalent circuit in the frequency domain is derived. According to the Norton theorem, the equivalent source representation is decoupled from the antenna. In particular, for photoconductive antennas (PCAs), the Norton circuit takes into account of the electrical and optical properties of the semiconductor material, the features of the laser excitation, as well as the geometrical dimensions of the gap. The presence of the electrodes around the gap is part of the antenna and, therefore, it is taken into account in the antenna impedance. The proposed circuit allows the analysis of the coupling between the photoconductive source and the antenna, providing a tool to analyze and design PCAs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2800524","European Research Council(grant numbers:ERC-2011-StG,AAATSI,278794); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8276317","Equivalent circuit;photoconductivity;terahertz (THz) photoconductive antenna (PCA);THz radiated power;THz source;THz technology","Antennas;Semiconductor lasers;Laser excitation;Integrated circuit modeling;Laser modes;Pump lasers;Frequency-domain analysis","","22","","50","IEEE","31 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The metallic strip of the conventional MSL is replaced with a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) arranged into a thin dielectric laminate, which leads to that two modes operating in different frequency bands, i.e., the quasi-TEM mode and the TE10-like mode, can propagate along the transmission line structure simultaneously. The DMC-MSL with a dual-layered planar configuration combines the merits of the MSL and the SIW. In addition, by adjusting the permittivity of the dielectric laminate used for realizing the thin SIW, the frequency ratio of the two operating modes can be varied flexibly. Based on the DMC-MSL structure, a novel dual-band leaky-wave antenna is presented. Periodic parasitic microstrip patches and the transverse slot array etched on the SIW are introduced in order to generate the required spatial harmonics. A feed structure that can excite the two operating modes of the DMC-MSL separately is designed as well. The fabricated prototype verifies that backward and forward frequency-scanning radiation beams are achieved within the low-frequency band from 5.75 to 8.5 GHz and the high-frequency band from 35 to 41.5 GHz, respectively.

On the one hand, by introducing transverse slots along the central line of patch, the medial part of out-of-phase longitudinal current is interrupted to circulate with little radiation. In this way, the patch serves as a full-wave dipole rather than a 3λ/2 one, and thus, the sidelobe level (SLL) in the E-plane is substantially reduced. On the other hand, the slots are installed in proximity to the nonradiative edges and at the patch center, respectively, to arouse distinctive effect on the current densities across the width of patch. Consequently, the beamwidth in the H-plane can be freely adjusted by different configurations of these slots. At last, a square patch antenna with three cascaded slots loaded along the central line is designed, fabricated, and tested.

The proposed fragmented antenna system is intended for a swarm of small unmanned aerial vehicles in a linear flight formation. Inductively end-loaded folded dipole antennas are used as radiating elements. The small antennas are designed so that they can individually radiate with small bandwidth when isolated. The overall dimensions and the total mass of these fabricated elements are  $12 \times 10\times 10$  cm ( $0.096\lambda _{0}\times 0.08\lambda _{0}\times 0.08\lambda _{0}$  at 240 MHz) and 18 g (including the matching network), respectively. Each miniaturized antenna can only provide 2.4 MHz (~1%) bandwidth and  $25~\Omega $  input impedance. Having proper electromagnetic coupling between a cluster of three of such elements, measurement results demonstrate that the middle element can provide 18.4 MHz bandwidth (7.7%, 7.7 fold improvement) and  $126~\Omega $  input impedance when the other two elements are loaded with optimal reactive elements. Moreover, the proposed configuration shows 1 dB gain improvement at boresight direction. The effects of flight formation fluctuations on the coupled antennas are also investigated, and it is shown that as the separation distance between the coupled antennas increases, the input impedance and bandwidth enhancement decrease. To overcome this problem, a tunable matching circuit containing a single varactor is proposed. Measurement results are shown to be in good agreement with the simulation predictions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2806397","U.S. Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-12-R-0012-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8292882","Antenna miniaturization;bandwidth enhancement;coupled antenna array;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted antenna","Dipole antennas;Bandwidth;Couplings;Impedance;Loaded antennas;Antenna arrays","","8","","28","IEEE","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This field can be estimated relying only on the volume allocated to the antenna and thus independently of the specific antenna geometry. The observable field is composed by a single spherical wave that first converges into the origin and then diverges to infinity. The power associated with the converging wave is the power available to an antenna located within the defined volume. Previously, an estimation of this observable spherical wave was obtained by truncating the spectral spherical modal series representation of the incident field. Here, instead, we provide more applicable approximation of the observable field, by truncating a spatial integral representation of the incident field that is based on the use of equivalent ideal currents. Eventually, for the vast majority of antennas, the estimation of the available power that can be obtained by approximating the observable field via the ideal currents is more accurate than the estimation that would be obtained via the spectral modal expansion. Moreover, analytical expressions for the observable field are provided here. The ideas are set here considering the case of single plane wave incidence, but the extension to multiple plane waves is straightforward.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2809427","ERC starting grant ERC-2011-STG(grant numbers:AAATSI 278794); ERC starting grant(grant numbers:LAA-THz-CC 639749); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302587","Antenna theory;equivalence theorem;receiving antennas;spherical modes","Receiving antennas;Antenna theory;Antenna accessories;Estimation;Transmitting antennas;Harmonic analysis","","5","","14","IEEE","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The beam-switchable reconfigurability is realized by electronically controlling the state of switches on the side apertures of a square substrate integrated waveguide (SIW). Four wide dipoles are loaded in front of the four apertures. To generate one desired unidirectional radiation beam, the corresponding aperture is switched ON, which excites the corresponding dipole. Meanwhile, the other three apertures are switched off and perform as electric walls in the SIW. In this way, the other three dipoles work as reflectors of the excited dipole. Wide bandwidths and good directional radiation patterns can be obtained. Two fully functional LP and CP antenna prototypes with more than 47% bandwidths are developed and tested. The measurement result demonstrates antennas with measured gains of approximately 4.5 dBi and radiation efficiencies of approximately 80% over the operating band. Owing to the symmetrical antenna structures, the two designs are capable of switching the radiation beam at every 90° in the azimuth plane with identical patterns.

By changing the dc bias voltages of p-i-n didoes, the operating state of the antenna can be reconfigured between the left-hand CP with a mode  $l = +1$  and right-hand CP (RHCP) with a mode  $l = -1$ , over the wide impedance bandwidth of 21%.

For the first proof-of-concept demonstration, simulations and measurements are comparatively presented for two single-polarized 19 × 19 arrays-the proposed SNA and its Vivaldi counterpart-each operating over a 1.2-12 GHz (10:1) band. Both arrays are built using typical vertically integrated printed-circuit board cards, and are designed to exhibit VSWR <; 2.5 within a 60° scan cone over most of the 10:1 band as infinite arrays. Measurement results compare very favorably with full-wave finite array simulations that include array truncation effects. The SNA array element demonstrates well-behaved polarization performance versus frequency, with more than 20 dB of D-plane θ = 45° polarization purity improvement at the high frequency. Moreover, the SNA element also: 1) offers better suppression of classical Vivaldi E-plane scan blindnesses; 2) requires fewer plated through vias for striplinebased designs; and 3) allows relaxed adjacent element electrical contact requirements for dual-polarized arrangements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2809476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302447","Flared notch;phased arrays;sliced-notch;tapered slot;ultrawideband (UWB) antennas;Vivaldi arrays","Slot lines;Prototypes;Blindness;Phased arrays;Bandwidth;Impedance","","92","","55","IEEE","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This finding therein motivates the main technical innovation in the present work-a simple reconfiguration of the upper Vivaldi fin into a series of coupled conductor segments to effectively control the aforementioned current ratio for significant reductions in crosspolarization, without reducing element profile or considerably hindering the excellent match and radiation efficiency of the original Vivaldi. Theory and design methodology for the SNA array are formulated, and followed by a concise set of design guidelines that are applied to reconfigure a representative 10:1 Vivaldi element into an SNA for practical reference, exhibiting a 20 dB reduction in peak cross-polarization ratio.

The ill-conditioning stems from the presence of interfaces between a positive permittivity background medium and the negative permittivity plasma and/or is due to low-frequency breakdown. To tackle these issues, the proposed ICVSIE wraps the negative permittivity plasma into a Huygens surface and exploits surface equivalence principles to artificially change the sign of the permittivity of the medium in which equivalent volumetric polarization currents radiate. Next, it combines a Muller combined field integral equation on the Huygens surface with a volume-surface integral equation for the negative permittivity plasma that coats the PEC surface in a manner that circumvents low-frequency breakdown.

Specifically, we applied ROSE for the treatment of weak-singular and hypersingular kernels in surface integral equations (SIEs) for the computation of electromagnetic (EM) scattering from perfect electrical conductors (PECs). Different from the existing forward methods, ROSE is based on reverse operations. The singular entries are not evaluated directly by analytical or numerical evaluation; instead, they are introduced as unknowns and are solved algebraically. For EM scattering from PEC, SIEs can be set up by using the Stratton-Chu representation formula. An auxiliary problem with the same meshed boundary is then formulated, of which any plane waves are the self-consistent solutions. It is shown that by applying a consistent discretization, the matrix of the auxiliary problem can be made identical with the original one. As a consequence, these self-consistent solutions can be utilized to solve the singular entries of the original system. Explicitly, a set of plane waves are interpolated using the appropriate basis functions. Subsequently, the corresponding coefficient vectors are utilized to construct small linear systems to solve the troublesome singular entries in the underlying matrix.

The concept of image sparsity in the transform domain is utilized to present the compressive sensing (CS) formulation for both mono-static and multistatic imaging at mm-wave frequencies. To reduce the complexity of the imaging system and reconstruction process, we introduce 1.5-D array structure, which is a random sparse array with orthogonal element locations. It is shown that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed image obtained by a 1.5-D array with 65% sparsity is very close to the PSNR of a uniform 2-D array for mono-static imaging. Moreover, for multistatic imaging, it is illustrated that a high-quality image is reconstructed with 92% reduction in antenna elements, which significantly reduces the cost, scan time, and system complexity. Furthermore, a 1.5-D array of 16 patch antennas with 60% sparsity, operating from 29 to 32 GHz is designed and implemented to investigate the performance of the proposed 1.5-D array for imaging, as well as the presented CS-based reconstruction method. Measurements show that the quality of the reconstructed image using this 1.5-D array with CS-based reconstruction is very close to a full 2-D array; for example, the PSNR achieved for the reconstructed image of a knife is 33 dB referenced to a uniform 2-D array. The proposed reconstruction method results in 6-11 dB improvement in PSNR compared with the conventional reconstruction methods with a reasonable increase in computing load.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2800531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8276268","Compressive sensing (CS);millimeter (mm)-wave imaging;mono-static;multistatic;sparse array","Imaging;Image reconstruction;Antenna arrays;Compressed sensing;Antenna measurements;Millimeter wave technology","","30","","23","IEEE","31 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, it associates the effective parameters to the permittivity and conductivity values that minimize the mean square error between the virtual scattered field (obtained by recombining the measured data) and the field scattered by a homogeneous dielectric cylinder centered on the target, having approximately the same area. The center of this effective scatterer and its radius can be estimated with a qualitative imaging algorithm or can be given as a priori information.

A technique known as outof-focus holography (OOF) has been developed to measure gravitational deformation. However, the TMRT has a shaped dual-reflector optical system, so the OOF technique cannot be used directly. An extended OOF (e-OOF) technique that can be used for a shaped telescope is proposed. A new calculation method is developed to calculate the extra phase and illumination. A new measurement strategy is proposed that uses only one feed, reduces the length of the scan pattern, and allows the telescope to scan smoothly at low speed. At the TMRT, the time required for each measurement is under 20 min, the achieved accuracy is approximately 50 μm, and the repeatability is sufficient. We have acquired a model for the gravitational deformation of the TMRT. After applying the model, there is a 150%-400% improvement in the aperture efficiency at low and high elevations. The model flattens the gain curve between 15°-80° elevations with an aperture efficiency of approximately 52%. The final weighted root-mean-square error is approximately 270 μm.

Specifically, the single eightarm spiral antenna is composed of a four-arm spiral for transmitting (TX) and a 45° spatially rotated four-arm spiral for receiving (RX). The eightarm spiral antenna is connected into two 4×4 Butler matrix beamforming networks (BFNs) to differentiate between the TX and RX arms/ports and distinguish their functionalities. In the absence of BFN imbalances and antenna geometry asymmetries, the isolation is theoretically infinite due to full cancellation at the RX antenna ports and RX beamformer ports. This approach also enables diverse co-polarized TX and RX radiation modes while maintaining theoretically infinite isolation. The considered spiral aperture modes are mode 1, with a broadside pattern, and modes 2 and 3, with conical patterns. The aperture is loaded with a hyperhemispherical dielectric lens to improve the far-field performance. The operational principles are discussed first under ideal conditions, followed by the computational and experimental results. Average measured isolation >38 dB is achieved over 3:1, 1.5:1, and 1.3:1 bandwidths for the radiating TX and RX modes 1-3, respectively.

By means of a circuit network analysis, it is found that bandwidth upper bounds of small tags are significantly higher in comparison with considering conjugate matching. Particularly, it is shown that the half-power bandwidth is √2 times (approximately 41%) higher, requiring a proper relaxation of the matching level at resonance. It is also shown that bandwidth of small real tags with perfect matching, which is typically far from its upper bound, can also be enhanced approximately the same factor at the expense of a small reduction (13.4%) in the peak read range. A practical example is provided, where two small split-ring resonator-based tags of the same size (k0a = 0.31) are designed. It demonstrates that such improvement on the tag bandwidth can be approximately obtained by simply changing the chip position, without the need of an external matching network.

Results of numerical scattering simulations are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the presented CSIE.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2800734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8278163","Combined source (CS);electric field integral equation (EFIE);electromagnetic scattering;Rao–Wilton–Glisson (RWG) functions","Surface impedance;Magnetic resonance;Integral equations;Mathematical model;Current density;Antennas;Testing","","14","","28","IEEE","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By using the 2W PE, both the forward and backward propagating effects can be taken into consideration. Moreover, the calculation can be taken in a marching manner by applying the FD method along the paraxial direction, and the unknowns are computed line by line in each transverse plane. In this way, the computational resources can be saved significantly. The proposed 2W 3-D ADI-PE method is used to analyze the electromagnetic propagating in the expressway with vehicles. The vehicles can be modeled with high accuracy by using the finite-difference scheme. Moreover, the proper impedance boundary conditions are added to the road of expressway and vehicles are regarded as the perfectly electrical conducting targets. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the electromagnetic propagation of expressway with vehicles.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2805018","Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:61431006,61701232); Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:BK20170854); Fundamental Research Funds for the central Universities(grant numbers:30917011317); State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves(grant numbers:K201805); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8290540","Alternating direction implicit (ADI)-parabolic equation (PE);electromagnetic propagating;finite differential (FD);two-way PE (2W PE)","Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Propagation;Numerical models;Boundary conditions;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays","","18","","27","IEEE","12 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the impact of the direction and beamwidth of the antenna pattern on distribution of the reception angle is shown on the basis of 3-D simulation studies. The obtained results show significant differences between the distributions of angle of arrival and the angle of reception. This means that the presented new method allows assessing the impact of the receiving antenna pattern on the correlation and spectral characteristics at the receiver input in simulation studies of wireless channel. The use of this method also provides an opportunity for analysis of coexistence between small cells and wireless backhaul, what is currently a significant problem in designing 5G networks.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2796719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8267033","Angle of arrival;angle of reception;angle spread;antenna radiation pattern;azimuthal and elevational planes;channel modeling;channel models;directional receiving antenna;geometric channel models;half-power beamwidth","Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Azimuth;Channel models;Directive antennas","","41","","19","IEEE","23 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed designs exhibit dual-band characteristics on the industrial, scientific, and medical bands (i.e., 915 and 2450 MHz) with small volumes: 344 mm3 (System A) and 406 mm3 (System B). Each system is integrated with the microelectronic components and a battery. The key feature of the proposed implantable antenna is its small volume (8 × 6 × 0.5 = 24 mm3) with a slotless and a vialess ground plane, thereby reducing design complexity. Moreover, the structure exhibits satisfactory peak gain values of -28.5 and -22.8 dBi at a lower and higher resonant band, respectively. Simulations using the finite-element method and finite-difference time domain are performed to evaluate the implantable systems. For validation, measurements are carried out in a saline solution. The antenna offers a good agreement between the measured and simulation results. In addition, a link budget is calculated to analyze the data transmission range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2801346","research fund of Hanyang University(grant numbers:HY-2018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8279423","Dual band;implantable;intracranial pressure (ICP);link budget;microelectronics","Antenna measurements;Skin;Dual band;Batteries;Slot antennas;Frequency measurement","","161","","16","IEEE","2 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
