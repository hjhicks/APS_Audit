Bounds on the Q-factor, inversely related to bandwidth, have been studied rigorously and reported extensively, but published investigations of efficiency limits are much less common. In this paper, expressions for the minimum dissipation ratio, and hence maximum efficiency, are derived using circuits that represent the six lowest order radiating modes. Examples consisting of a wide range of elementary shapes demonstrate that even though an antenna may approach its Q-bound quite closely, it typically has dissipation well above the new lower bounds due to higher order modes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2809507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8304666","Antenna efficiency;coupled mode analysis;electrically small antennas;Q-factor;radar cross section","Antennas;Shape;Impedance;Integrated circuit modeling;Surface impedance;Bandwidth;Q-factor","","20","","34","IEEE","28 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CRA and the MMA are used to code the received electromagnetic (EM) field in space and in frequency, at the focal plane array. The MMA is modeled by an equivalent magnetodielectric medium having a definite thickness. A high-frequency method based on physical optics is used to build the sensing matrix of the system, and the inverse problem is solved using a Nesterov-based compressive sensing (CS) methodology. Numerical examples are carried out in order to reconstruct the physical temperature of the Earth's surface. The performance of the proposed system is compared to that of the conventional interferometric system, GeoSTAR. Preliminary results show that the metamaterial-based CRA provides comparable performance to the GeoSTAR configuration with only half of the feeding elements while keeping the same physical aperture size for the two configurations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2809488","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(grant numbers:NA09AANEG0080); NSF CAREER program(grant numbers:1653671); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302597","Compressive reflector antenna (CRA);imaging;metamaterial absorber;phased array;radio interferometry","Manganese;Mathematical model;Magnetic resonance imaging;Antennas;Metamaterials;Sensors","","12","","40","IEEE","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By relying on both frequency- and time-domain optimization, the antenna achieves excellent IR-UWB characteristics. In free-space conditions, an impedance bandwidth of 1.92 GHz (or 29.4%), a total efficiency higher than 89%, a front-to-back ratio of at least 12.1 dB, and a gain higher than 6.3 dBi are measured in the frequency domain. Furthermore, a system fidelity factor larger than 98% and a relative group delay smaller than 100 ps are measured in the time domain within the 3 dB beamwidth of the antenna. As a result, the measured time-of-arrival of a transmitted Gaussian pulse, for different angles of arrival, exhibits variations smaller than 100 ps, corresponding to a maximum distance estimation error of 3 cm. Additionally, the antenna is validated in a real-life worst-case deployment scenario, showing that its characteristics remain stable in a large variety of deployment scenarios. Finally, the difference in frequency- and time-domain performance is studied between the antenna implemented in AFSIW and in dielectric filled substrate integrated waveguide (DFSIW) technology.

In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the effects of bending applied on wearable patch antennas over cylindrical surfaces. The resonant frequency variations and radiation pattern variations have been studied by simulating and measuring patch antennas that are bent by different angles. A frequency shift plot with respect to bending radius has been generated to target antennas for various wearable applications. An analytical approach has been presented to study the effect of resonant frequency shifting for both E- and H-planes bending. A lumped element circuit model is used to interpret the E-plane bending from different perspectives.

A slotted line balun is employed to achieve broadband impedance matching and realize balanced-to-unbalanced transformation. The designed HP omnidirectional antenna exhibits a fractional bandwidth of 24.7% with VSWR <; 2 ranging from 39 to 50 MHz. Uniform omnidirectional radiation patterns in the azimuth plane with HP have been obtained. The loop antenna provides a relatively low gain of no more than 1.5 dBi.

As well known to all, the technology for circularly polarized (CP) patch antenna has been often restrictedly achieved by altering the shape of patch conductor surface by a few standard manufacturing processes. Benefited from the 3-D printing technology, it is demonstrated here that CP waves can be alternatively generated via an intact metal patch mounted on low-profile inhomogeneous substrate. As for the inhomogeneous superstrate, low profile is insufficient to make it become a polarizer. As such, a dual-band and dual-CP stacked patch antenna is proposed, where the lower patch and its superstrate exactly serve as the ground and substrate of the upper one. Different impacts of low-profile inhomogeneous substrate and superstrate on polarization are utilized to ensure the isolation of left- and right-hand circular polarizations. Besides, due to the usage of intact patches, two operating bands are independently formed and can be easily located in proximity to each other. A prototype operating at 2.75 and 3.2 GHz is then fabricated and measured. Measured results are found in reasonably a good agreement with the simulated ones.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2810330","National Natural Science Foundation of China through the General Program(grant numbers:61571468); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under the FDCT Research(grant numbers:091/2016/A2); University of Macau under the Multi-Year Research(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00007-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8304690","3-D printed antenna;dual band;dual-circularly polarized (CP);inhomogeneous substrate;stacked patch antenna","Substrates;Patch antennas;Nonhomogeneous media;Antenna measurements;Dual band;Printing;Dipole antennas","","55","","40","IEEE","28 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conjugate match is attainable between the antenna and the microchip and it is able to achieve a maximum read distance of 10.7 m at the effective isotropic radiated power of 4 W.

A restarting technique is introduced for the circular polarization design case, where the high cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) is hard to be realized. By increasing the weight of cross-polarization penalization function after the optimization restarts, much higher XPD is achieved compared to that of the antennas optimized with fixed subobjective weighting factors.

And also, a slot line transition is placed at the common port of the two structures for impedance matching with the ridge SIW dual-polarized horn antenna. In this way, the dual-polarized horn antenna is designed with an exponential ridge structure simultaneously for better impedance matching and higher efficiency of the antenna. To verify the functionality of the proposed integrated OMT-antenna structure, an experimental prototype is fabricated and measured, and a good agreement is found between its simulation and measured results.

In order to derive statistical results on this distortion, specifically on determining the probability of exceeding a certain sidelobe level (SLL), it is often assumed that the magnitude of the array amplitude pattern follows a Rician distribution. It is shown that the Rician distribution implies two assumptions, and therefore, a more general Beckmann distribution is proposed to describe the distribution of the magnitude of the array amplitude pattern. Using Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that the use of a Beckmann distribution outperforms the Rician distribution. Also, the seemingly counterintuitive result that the maximum probability of exceeding a certain SLL, in general, does not have to be at the angle where the highest sidelobe in the error-free case is located, is obtained. Due to this result, the importance of using an angular probability plot is emphasized. Furthermore, a physical explanation for the observed seemingly counterintuitive behavior is given.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2800519","NXP Semiconductors; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8276647","Antenna radiation patterns;error analysis;phased arrays;probability;random noise","Rician channels;Correlation;Antenna radiation patterns;Random variables;Gaussian distribution;Phased arrays;Reactive power","","29","","9","IEEE","31 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve the resultant nonconvex and nonlinear optimization problem, we introduce auxiliary variables to decouple the array weight vector in the objective function from the complicated constraints on main lobes and sidelobes, and then, the array weight vector and auxiliary variables are updated alternately via ADMM. To determine the array weight vector with the lp norm, we analyze the convexity or concavity of the subfunction related to each weight element using its derivatives. On the other hand, we divide the objective function of auxiliary variables into multiple nonlinear subfunctions, each of which is only dependent of the magnitude of the corresponding auxiliary variable and is calculated in parallel via analyzing simplified two-sided constraints.

Thanks to its self-adaptive behavior, the device allows faithfully emulating the reflection from a flat metallic plane, regardless the incidence angle of the illuminating field. However, the antennas reduce the amount of reflected energy due to their intrinsic limits in absorption. Except for this aspect, it acts in a similar fashion as a carpet cloak, restoring the signal reflection from the ground, even in the presence of an extremely electrically large object. The concept is numerically and experimentally verified by covering an electrically large metallic triangular bump (2.8λ0×5.6λ0) with a pair of equal antenna arrays.

The proposed approach is a low cost one compared with those with phase shifters. It is found that in spherical coordinate system (r, θ, and φ), for any constant r and θ, as φ varies from 0 to 2π, the phase of the CP antenna's copolarized far field will progress linearly by 2π, and the magnitude is constant. If a CP antenna is rotated around its own phase center by certain degrees, there is a phase difference between the copolarized electric far fields generated by the antenna before and after rotation. An N × N array with such CP antennas elements is analyzed. The array can generate beam steering with different rotation angles of adjacent elements.

In this paper, a novel substrate-integrated E-plane waveguide (SIEW) horn antenna is proposed and used to design an E-plane horn antenna array. It radiates electric field parallel to the printed circuit board (PCB) and gives narrow beam in the E-plane and broad beam in the H-plane. The antenna is fabricated by stacking two PCBs with copper strips sandwiched in between. The rows of plated through holes are drilled to support vertical current, and the sandwiched copper strips are used to support longitudinal current. With both the vertical and longitudinal currents on the vertical wall, electric field parallel to the PCB can be guided to the aperture and radiated into the air. A trapezoidal dielectric load is applied to improve impedance matching and gain. An SIEW-to-SMA transition is designed for measurement. For array design, a two-way SIEW power divider is designed based on its equivalent circuit.

First, a novel quasi-static approximation is assumed with γ2 ≈ -iλ so that the integrands of the Fourier-Bessel representations for ELF field are approximated near the poles by adopting Maclaurin's Expansion. Second, by the conditions of k2ρ ≪ 1, z/ρ ≪ 1, and d/ρ ≪ 1, the ratio of wave numbers for rock and sea k2/k1 is equivalent to an infinitesimal that only fundamental terms of |k22γ2|/|k12γ1| are reserved for the electromagnetic components. Third, the approximated formulas are derived for ELF near-field propagation generated by a horizontal electric dipole with the above simplifications. Finally, the simplified formulas are verified by an analogy with the exact and approximated formulas, respectively. It demonstrates that the proposed formulas are complementarily essential for evaluations of ELF near field and the plotted Poynting vectors indicate approximately the propagation direction of the energy flow.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2810328","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271086,61571389); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8304701","Extremely low frequency (ELF) near field;horizontal electric dipole;sea-rock boundary","Ground penetrating radar;Geophysical measurement techniques;Electromagnetic fields;Rocks;Geometry;Dielectrics","","20","","20","IEEE","28 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this comprehensive formulation, in addition to the direct and reflected wave, a third field component is taken into account, physically originated by the diffraction at the interface of the two media. This component, ignored by ray-based techniques, can become predominant and stimulate the near-ground propagation.

To apply the attractive properties illustrated above, a new method named CS-FEKO is proposed in this paper, which introduces the ideas from CS into commercial software field computations involving bodies of arbitrary shape (FEKO) to improve the efficiency of FEKO in solving multistatic scattering problems. In performing a multistatic scattering analysis with CS-FEKO, the far-zone scattered fields in one scattering angle over all excitations are viewed as the signal of interest. The CS is first utilized as a preprocessing of FEKO, which modifies the conventional plane incident waves to the excitations that the CS needed. Then, FEKO is applied to solve the scattering problems under the new set of excitations to get the measurements of the scattered fields. Finally, the CS is secondly introduced as a postprocessing of FEKO, where CS inversion is employed to recover the desired far-zone multistatic scattered fields. To make a full use of the high efficiency and the deep optimization benefits of FEKO in solving wide-angle scattering problems, two forms of measurement matrixes are introduced, which have a more concise expression, and can reduce the simulating runtimes dramatically. The multistatic scattering radar cross section for different objects obtained from CS-FEKO are presented and compared with those derived from FEKO to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2816599","China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M613067); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JB170501); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61621005); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61431010,61501360); 111 Project(grant numbers:B17035); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8318635","Compressive sensing (CS);FEKO;multistatic scattering","Electromagnetic scattering;Nickel;Method of moments;Matrix converters;Integral equations;Sparse matrices","","7","","26","IEEE","16 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since ducted propagation acts as a leaky waveguide, the vertical array elements in various transmit and receive height combinations effectively observe differing combinations of the modal components propagating in the duct, the use of multiple combinations improves the estimation of duct properties. The aforementioned measurement campaigns occurred near the coast of southern California; the SoCal 2013 experiment and the Scripps Pier Campaign. During both campaigns, the propagation loss recorded at each of the receivers from each of the transmitters, standardized by the total received power, was compared to variable terrain radio parabolic equation model predictions in order to estimate the evaporation duct height (EDH).

Due to the long time duration of pulse radar signal and the limited space of anechoic chamber, the reflected signal returns before the pulse radar signal is fully transmitted, which makes it difficult for the signal reception. As a consequence, the target high-resolution range profile (HRRP) cannot be obtained for target imaging and recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy that contains two steps to solve this problem and obtain the target HRRP. First, the randomly interrupted transmitting and receiving (R-ITR) method is proposed to receive the pulse radar signal in RFS. Second, the target HRRP is reconstructed by compressive sensing (CS) since the R-ITR echo is piecewise sparse. The protocol to choose R-ITR parameters and performance of HRRP reconstruction are provided. Simulations and experiments with different R-ITR parameters are also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2814202","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61101180,61401491,61490692); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8314762","Compressive sensing (CS);high-resolution range profile (HRRP);pulse radar;radio frequency simulation (RFS);randomly interrupted transmitting and receiving (R-ITR)","Radar imaging;Radio frequency;Radar antennas;Image reconstruction;Imaging","","15","","27","IEEE","12 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The feeding scheme also establishes a cross-coupled structure in the DRA, which introduces a radiation null at the upper edge of the passband.

As a pair, the RWG basis is used for arbitrarily shaped conductor surface. This proposed method has several advantages for objects comprising planar thin dielectric materials. First of all, the use of prism elements can significantly reduce the number of unknowns compared with the general tetrahedral mesh scheme so that the CPU time consumption and memory occupation are reduced. In addition, the prism elements also result in a more convenient meshing procedure.

It is observed that this method exhibits superior performance and consumes far less memory and CPU time than the traditional implementation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2809697","National Excellent Youth Fund through NSFC(grant numbers:61425010); Chang Jiang Scholar Project of MOE; National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61490695); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of NSFC(grant numbers:61721001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302973","H-matrices;antenna arrays;finite-element method (FEM)–boundary element method (BEM);noconformal domain decomposition method (DDM);Schwarz preconditioner","Finite element analysis;Antenna arrays;Convergence;Symmetric matrices;Sparse matrices;Silicon;MLFMA","","17","","36","IEEE","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
