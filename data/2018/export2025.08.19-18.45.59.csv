Characteristic mode analysis (CMA) enables to use a conductor with the symmetric structure itself as an antenna. Based on CMA, it is possible to implement a multiport MIMO antenna on the conductor using a mode-decoupling network (MDN). As the number of antennas increases, however, the complexity of the MDN becomes large, making design difficult. In this paper, we propose a simpler systematic design method for a multiport MIMO antenna on an electrically small and bilaterally symmetric conductor. More specifically, the implementation of the MDN depends on the design of the coupling elements that excite characteristic modes, so a design method for its position and shape is proposed. Owing to the well-designed coupling elements, a simple systematic design of the multiport MIMO antenna is suggested. The proposed design method is verified by simulation and measurement of a buglike 3-port MIMO antenna operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, applicable to biomimetic drones. The antenna is realized using an FR-4 substrate with dimensions of 50 mm x 61.5 mm x 10 mm (0.4λ0 x 0.49λ0 x 0.08λ0 at 2.4 GHz).

The decoupling technique only requires a capacitive load on the shorting arm of each coupled IFA without connecting a circuitry or inserting a physical structure between the two coupled antennas. The capacitive load occupies very little space and is frequency-insensitive; therefore, the decoupling technique is a very favorable choice for low-frequency applications. Network analysis is presented to mathematically justify the working mechanism and to provide a design guideline. Several practical cases of two IFAs situated at different positions on the periphery of a PCB board are studied. The experimental results show that with the decoupling technique, significant improvements in the port isolation (from 10 to 20 dB), antenna correlation coefficient (from 0.25 to 0.05), multiplexing efficiency (from 46% to 60%), and above all the system throughput (1.2 and 0.8 dB power saving in Urban Microcell and Urban Macrocell channels, respectively) can be obtained.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2790041","Postgraduate Scholarship of The Chinese University of Hong Kong; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247216","Antenna array;decoupling technique;inverted-F antenna (IFA);long-term evolution (LTE);multiple input multiple output (MIMO);mutual coupling;throughput test","Loaded antennas;Mutual coupling;MIMO communication;Wireless communication;Throughput;Mobile antennas","","75","","29","IEEE","5 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this aim, a novel balanced inductive exciter (BIE) is introduced to improve the modal excitation purity of some CMs. In fact, even if the optimal position of the exciters on the hosting platform is determined by using the CM theory, the excitation purity of each mode plays a fundamental role in the radiation efficiency of the radiating system. In particular, achieving a good level of excitation purity strongly reduces the reactive power (Preac) stored in the near-field zone and hence maximizes the amount of the radiated power (Pr). To better highlight the benefits offered by the presented approach, a set of BIEs is applied on a platform to obtain a fully reconfigurable radiation pattern. The evaluation of the Preac, Pr, and equivalent isotropically radiated power provided by the BIE reveals the importance of a pure modal excitation.

Filtering response is obtained by adding nonradiative elements, including a coupled U-shaped microstrip line and two I-shaped slots, to the feeding network. Within the operating passband, the added nonradiative elements do not work, and thus the in-band radiation performance of the dipole antenna is nearly not affected. However, at the side stopbands, the added elements resonate and prevent the signal passing through the feeding network to the dipole antenna, suppressing the out-of-band radiation significantly. As a result, both satisfactory filtering and radiation performances are obtained. For demonstration, an omnidirectional filtering dipole antenna is implemented. Single-band bandpass filtering responses in both the reflection coefficient and realized gain are obtained. The measured in-band gain is ~2.5 dBi, whereas the out-of-band radiation suppression is more than 15 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2790169","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61725102,61671210); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China(grant numbers:2017B090901053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247220","Dipole antenna;filtering antenna;omnidirectional radiation pattern","Dipole antennas;Filtering;Substrates;Ports (Computers);Antenna radiation patterns;Gain;Microstrip","","76","","38","IEEE","5 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method is further utilized to efficiently optimize the dispersive properties of the AIS, which has a deep subwavelength radius, for tuning the impedance bandwidth of a monopole, thereby achieving a greatly broadened yet controllable bandwidth. Three AIS-coated antenna examples with different ratio bandwidths are illustrated, with their corresponding discrete realistic structures designed, fabricated, and characterized. The measured results agree strongly with simulation predictions, experimentally exhibiting a VSWR <; 2 ratio bandwidth of 1.91:1, 2.79:1, and 3.81:1, respectively.

However, simulation shows that the main beam is tilted away from the azimuth plane when the antenna length exceeds 2λ due to high-order resonant mode interference.

This DRA is applied to the first omnidirectional circularly polarized (CP) diversity DRA. To generate omnidirectional CP fields, the TM $_{01\delta }$  and TE $_{011+\delta }$  modes are excited simultaneously. The TE $_{011+\delta }$  mode is excited by four microstrip arcs. They provide a pair of equivalent magnetic dipoles that generate fields that are orthogonal to those of the TM $_{01\delta }$  mode. Omnidirectional CP fields can be obtained when the (orthogonal) fields of the TM $_{01\delta }$  and TE $_{011+\delta }$  modes are equal in amplitude but in phase quadrature. In our two-port CP diversity design, phase differences of +90° and −90° are obtained in ports 1 and 2 to generate right- and left-hand CP fields, respectively. Prototypes at ~2.4 GHz were designed, fabricated, and measured for WLAN applications. The S-parameters, radiation patterns, antenna gains, and efficiencies are studied.

Some improvement can be achieved by the use of corrugations of fixed dimensions. This usual approach, however, gives little room for improvement in their performance. To overcome this situation, we have developed a new approach: the use of a nonspecific profile and variable corrugations along the antenna, both of which can be optimized to considerably improve its performance. For the optimization, we have used a particle-swarm algorithm allowing us to achieve an excellent performance in the entire W-band. To demonstrate the efficiency of this new approach, we have implemented an optimized antenna using standard printed circuit board (PCB)-prototyping methods. Across the whole W-band, the constructed antenna shows sidelobe levels, reflection coefficient, and cross polarization below -16, -10, and -25 dB, respectively. These results are in good agreement with simulations which also predict possible operation down to 60 GHz.

The TA performance directly depends on its composing unit-cell characteristics. Planar unit cells can be categorized into two main types: phase-rotation (PR) and phase-delay (PD) cells. There is no hint in the literature about the relative merits of these two types of cells for circular polarization when assessing the final TA performance. This paper offers a systematic comparison between the cells' working principles and analyzes their impacts on TA performance. Examples of a PR-based TA and a PD-based TA are designed for single-band wide-angle beam steering operating at the satellite Ka-band. They are evaluated by simulation and measurement to quantify performance differences. No previous work employed a PR TA for wide-angle beam steering. This paper shows that PR TA offers a filtering effect toward the cross-polarization component of the source. This leads to better axial ratio and combined 3 dB axial ratio and 3 dB gain bandwidth. However, PD cells are easier to design and insensitive to feed polarization. The analysis in this paper allows a more informed decision when selecting the unit-cell category for any given TA application.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2787540","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(grant numbers:UID/EEA/50008/2013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240664","Circular polarization (CP);flat lens;frequency-selective surface (FSS);mechanical scanning;satellite on the move (SOTM);transmit arrays (TAs);wireless communication network","Polarization;Beam steering;Feeds;Lenses;Satellite communication;Delays;Scattering parameters","","52","","26","IEEE","27 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve the high gain, high efficiency, and wideband at the same time, a CP 2 × 2 subarray antenna is proposed at first, consisting of integrated horns, complementary phase shifters, and a dual-polarized power divider (PD). The complementary phase shifter includes a parallel capacitance phase shifter and a parallel inductance phase shifter. Phase shifts generated by inductance and capacitance structures present opposite tendencies versus frequency. Therefore, an appropriate combination of them will make the phase shift almost constant over a wideband, which is important to generate a wideband CP beam. Besides, the capacitance phase shifter can be implemented by inserting irises at waveguide broadsides, while the inductance phase shifter can be achieved by inserting irises at the waveguide narrow side. Such a simple configuration can guarantee the element spacing limitation and the fabrication accuracy. The dual-polarized PD consists of an octagon cavity with rotated symmetrical coupling slots for wideband equal-amplitude and in-phase outputs. In addition, some matching layers and matching ridges in the octagon cavity are introduced to achieve wideband matching. Finally, a wideband array feeding network is used to build a 16 × 16-element left-handed CP array antenna.

Here, we re-derive these conditions using a medium-based-and hence, more insightful-approach based on generalized sheet transition conditions and surface susceptibility tensors, and experimentally demonstrate for the first time, beyond any doubt, two diffraction-free refractive metasurfaces that are essentially lossless, passive, bianisotropic, and reciprocal.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2793958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8259235","Bianisotropy;field transformations;metasurface;refraction","Tensile stress;Diffraction;Antennas;Complexity theory;Scattering parameters;Electromagnetics;Absorption","","152","","34","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By utilizing the SCW as one propagation path in the unit cell, two resonators can be generated intrinsically without introducing any extra structures. In addition, the parallel-plate waveguide constructed by sandwiching the ABS frame between outer conductors of adjacent SCWs will provide a second propagation path and create another resonator. With the help of these resonators, a passband with two transmission poles can be obtained. Furthermore, there are two finite transmission zeros locating at both sides of the passband due to the fact that the signals passing through these two propagation paths are combined out of phase, leading to both-sided sharp roll-off skirt. The E-field analysis and equivalent circuit model presented offer a physical insight into the operating principle of the proposed 3-D FSS.

The derived analytical formulas allow us to easily find the physical dimensions of conductive patterns, which implement the required surface impedance. Numerical verification of the method shows excellent agreement with the analytical predictions, allowing the design of an arbitrary impedance without any optimization process. The method can be applied for designing lossy and low-loss metasurfaces, which can be used for absorption and wavefront manipulation of electromagnetic waves. As a representative example, the design of thin perfect absorbers has been approached using the developed method. The results demonstrate that the methodology adapts various material sheet resistivity, opening new possibilities for the design of printable metasurfaces, where the sheet resistivity of conductor strongly depends on the specific printing method.

This paper combines the two approaches, to extract surrogate models of arched tunnels in the form of rectangular waveguides. The parameters of the latter are optimized to match their propagation characteristics to those of the original arched tunnel, as predicted by the VPE method. The accuracy and limitations of these surrogate models are thoroughly evaluated.

Assuming that the transmit antenna (or emitted field) is fixed and the phases associated with different tiles are independent, this paper proposes a phase evolution model based on the relative spatial locations of the receive antenna (Rx) to each tile. The proposed model contains two parts: the deterministic part that depends on the variation of the distance from Rx to tile center, and the correlated random part that depends on the variation of the angle between the Rx and the normal vector of tile. The correlation of the tile field phases resulting from the angular variation is modeled by the exponentially damped cosine correlation function. The proposed phase evolution model is evaluated by being applied to the ER approach to predict the DS component of radio channel transfer function (CTF).

The infinite PEC boundary is considered by applying the image principle to the spherical modes of the device under test (DUT). Only the measurements above the ground are required to iteratively solve the inverse problem for the unknown spherical mode coefficients. Due to additional modal translation operators, the scan center of the spherical measurement system does not need to lie in the ground plane. Moreover, if the DUT is positioned at an appropriate height above the ground plane, the free-space sources of the DUT are extractable with good accuracy. By employing the nonequispaced FFT, the near field can be irregularly sampled on the spherical measurement surface.

The path loss (PL) agrees well in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) regions, whereas the shadowing factor exhibits differences in the NLOS regions. Additional simulations are conducted for downtown Gangnam, a representative high-rise urban area in Seoul, South Korea. The simulated and measured coverages of 300 base stations operating in 900 MHz long-term evolution band are compared and analyzed.

In its final state, the active denial antenna cannot be characterized by conventional measurement techniques including direct far-field pattern characterization or near-field scanning. However, the high power transmitted from Active Denial (100 kW average) provides the means of rapidly recording near-field antenna beam patterns using infrared imaging. Although these thermal images provide a magnitude-only snapshot of the near-field antenna beam, phase can be retrieved from measurements at two different ranges using the iterative Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm.

This communication proposes the use of parasitic scatterers to improve the performance of an existing 7T MRI coil called the single-sided adapted dipole (SSAD) antenna. The results reveal that scatterers arranged in a Yagi fashion can be applied to reduce local specific absorption rate maxima of a reference SSAD by 40% with only a 6% decrease in the propagated  $B_{1}^{+}$  field at the tissue depth of 15 cm. The higher directivity of the proposed design also decreases the coupling with additional elements, making this antenna suitable for use in high-density arrays.

The rotated antenna array proposed acquires two co-pol and one cross-pol signals in terms of the “local” polarization basis by means of three antenna pairs. Then, the fully polarimetric signals in a global polarization basis are retrieved via simple polarization basis transformation, which overcomes the spatially varied polarizations of the signals acquired at different positions and makes valid the assumption of traditional imaging algorithms that the polarization is constant within the aperture. The proposed rotated antenna array takes advantage of the synthetic aperture technique to synthesize a 2-D array for 3-D full-pol imaging. It utilizes a significantly smaller number of antennas in comparison to traditional fully polarimetric imaging arrays and also provides sufficiently accurate estimation to the full-pol electromagnetic signals scattered from targets. Both numerical simulations and experimental measurements have been performed and the results show the tolerance of the antenna array topology proposed to the quasi-monostatic measurements, its effectiveness, and accuracy for full-pol short-range microwave imaging.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2794408","NeTTUN project; European Commission within the FP-7 Framework(grant numbers:280712); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8262649","Fully polarimetric imaging;microwave imaging;rotated array;signal retrieval/estimation;ultrawideband (UWB) radar","Antenna arrays;Imaging;Antenna measurements;Arrays;Topology;Aperture antennas","","3","","15","IEEE","17 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this communication, two FSS designs have been presented, and they are named as FSS and M_FSS. M_FSS is a slightly modified version of FSS. With FSS, isolation enhancement and RCS reduction have been achieved by altering antenna characteristics. With M_FSS, the same can be achieved by preserving the antenna characteristics. The RCS reductions of 25 and 20 dBsm have been achieved by replacing the PEC ground plane with FSS and M_FSS, respectively. Also, by using the proposed FSS, a stable RCS reduction up to 60° for TE polarization and up to 45° for TM polarization has been achieved.

One major difficulty comes from the multiscale nature of the high-definition geometry, in which the spatial scales differ by orders of magnitude. It often leads to strongly nonuniform discretizations, and a large, dense, and ill-conditioned matrix equation to solve. The work investigates an adaptive coarse-graining domain decomposition method for the integral equation-based solution of large, complex EM problems. A parallel and multilevel skeletonization approach is employed to construct effective coarse-grid basis functions locally per subdomain. The benefits of the work include a well-preconditioned system, an effective matrix compression, and the reduced computational costs.

In this communication, a message passing interface parallel skeletonization scheme is developed to alleviate the memory usage and to incorporate with the parallel multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) for large targets, which are hundreds of wavelengths in size. The parallel scheme includes two ingredients. One is to feed into the ID, a size-reduced matrix to find skeleton right-hand sides. This matrix is produced upon skeleton RWGs instead of their original counterpart. The other is to integrate the parallel ID into the parallel MLFMA to alleviate the peak memory usage of skeletonization on each participating process. Numerical experiments show that the peak memory usage for the skeletonization can be less than 2 GB in each process for the target about 300 wavelengths in size.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2794404","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771053,61371002,61421001); 111 Project of China(grant numbers:B14010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8262657","Computational electromagnetics;message passing;method of moments;multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA);parallel algorithms;radar cross sections (RCSs)","Skeleton;Memory management;MLFMA;Antennas;Electromagnetics;Message passing;Matrix decomposition","","14","","21","IEEE","17 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The bottom FSS layer works as a filter for allowing in-band signal to pass and reflecting out-of-band signal, while the top EBG layer adopts 0 and π reflection phase cells with a chessboard distribution to reduce the backward scattering wave. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the planar and cylindrical surfaces are, respectively, designed to verify such two functionalities. Our FSS-EBG surface can make the antenna signal transmit at S-band with small insertion loss and simultaneously provide wideband low-scattering property at X-Ku band, which is suitable to be used as the stealth antenna radome.
