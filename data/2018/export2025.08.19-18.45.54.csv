This reflectarray antenna consists of a wideband feed and a wideband reflecting surface. The feed is a log-periodic dipole array antenna. The reflecting surface consists of 26 × 11 unit cells. Each cell is composed of a tightly coupled dipole and a delay line. The minimum distance between adjacent cells is 8 mm, which is about 1/10 wavelength at the lowest operating frequency. By combining the advantages of reflectarray antennas and those of tightly coupled array antennas, the proposed TCDR antenna achieves ultrawide bandwidth with reduced complexity and fabrication cost. A method to minimize the phase errors of the wideband reflectarray is also developed and the concept of equivalent distance delay is introduced to design the unit cell elements. To verify the design concept, a prototype operating from 3.4 to 10.6 GHz is simulated and fabricated. Good agreement between simulated and measured results is observed. Within the designed frequency band, the radiation pattern of the TCDR antenna is stable and the main beam of the antenna is not distorted or split. The side lobe levels of the radiation patterns are below -11.7 dB in the entire operating band.

The antenna is designed for near-field focusing, at a range of 2.1 m from the primary aperture and to work in the frequency range from 200 to 600 GHz. The half-power beamwidth (HPBW) is 0.27° (1 cm in the image plane) at 500 GHz, corresponding to a focused antenna directivity of approximately 55 dBi. The FOV is as large as ±25.4° (±1 m at the nominal range), corresponding to a scan range of ±100 HPBWs. The shapes of the lens surfaces are optimized to minimize the phase aberration loss over the entire scanning range. Moreover, the lenses are designed to be as thin as possible to limit the dielectric absorption loss. The directivity reduction of the edge pattern with respect to broadside is approximately 1 dB with efficiency of 56%, making this lens an excellent candidate for imaging applications.

Pairs of circular slot resonators and metal strip array resonators are introduced in the absorber to realize a notch band with full reflectance in the vertical polarization, while a wide absorption band in the horizontal polarization is maintained. The proposed band-notched absorber is thus realized. Within the notch band, the absorber can be served as a metal ground for antenna; while a great RCS reduction is obtained out of the notch band and in the horizontal polarization band. Then, a dipole antenna rigorously designed is mounted above the band-notched absorber, whose operating frequency is exactly in accordance with that of the notch band. The proposed low RCS antenna is established based on assembling the dipole antenna and the band-notched absorber together. The measured results demonstrate that the proposed antenna has fairly good radiation patterns.

The CAMS is formed by two kinds of frequency-selective surfaces. The upper surface of CAMS is designed to reduce RCS based on the phase cancellation principle, and the bottom surface is used to enhance antenna gain on the basis of FP resonator cavity theory. Both simulation and measured results indicate that compared with primary antenna, the gain of the proposed FP resonator antenna is enhanced by 4.9 dB at 10.8 GHz and the 3 dB gain bandwidth is from 9.4 to 11.1 GHz (16.58%). Meanwhile, the RCS of the proposed FP resonator antenna is reduced from 8 to 18 GHz, with peak reduction of 39.4 dB. The 10 dB RCS reduction is obtained almost from 9.6 to 16.9 GHz (55.09%) for arbitrary polarizations.

The corresponding components of the system are required to cover these two frequency bands simultaneously. However, it is difficult for the existing dual-band antenna configurations to achieve a frequency ratio larger than 3. In this paper, a novel topology is proposed to solve this problem. For the desired dual-band operation, a signal routing approach is proposed to guide the microwave/millimeter signals to the specific elements, respectively. The classical aperture coupling mechanism is deliberately utilized to block the millimeter-wave signal from feeding to the microwave antenna element and route the millimeter-wave signal into the millimeter-wave antenna element. Meanwhile, the substrate- integrated waveguide (SIW)-based millimeter-wave antenna element has the high-pass nature to reject the microwave signal. Therefore, the antenna elements for microwave and millimeter-wave bands can be designed separately with a high flexibility. First, a dual-band antenna was implemented to support 5.8 and 30 GHz simultaneously by integrating an annular-ring antenna element and an SIW slot antenna element. Furthermore, different radiation properties at the two bands can be easily realized owing to the high flexibility of the proposed approach. For validation, these two antennas were fabricated and measured.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2786321","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671485); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China(grant numbers:201510010084); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:16lgzd04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8234578","Circularly polarized;dual-band antenna;large frequency ratio;omnidirectional","Microwave antennas;Millimeter wave technology;Apertures;Microwave communication;Topology;Microwave filters","","100","","30","IEEE","22 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed PUMA array class achieves twice the bandwidth (from 3:1 to 6:1) of the conventional shorted via-based PUMA without using an external matching network and while retaining convenient unbalanced feeding, manufacturing, and assembly characteristics. The chief enabling technical innovation hinges upon the reconfiguration of shorting vias into capacitively-loaded vias that simultaneously: 1) mitigate low-frequency bandwidth-limiting loop modes and 2) shift problematic common-mode resonances out-of-band. A simple theoretical model based on ridged waveguides is proposed that qualitatively and quantitatively explains this novel common-mode mitigation.

For verification purposes, a 4 × 2 self-mixing array is fabricated and measured in the frequency range from 34 to 39 GHz. A multiple-resonance millimeter-wave microstrip patch antenna has been especially developed to achieve large bandwidth and a wide angular receiving range.

Periodic scatterers in the shape of loaded dipoles (dogbones) are used on each layer to create a single-stopband response. Multiple such layers are cascaded together to create the desired multistopband response. An equivalent circuit model for a multilayer FSS that explicitly and intuitively accounts for electromagnetic coupling interactions between the layers is proposed and investigated. This model is used in a novel design method, which precompensates for the effect of coupling during circuit-based design stage rather than postcompensating through iterative full-wave (FW) optimization after the design stage, as in most traditional approaches. As a consequence, this approach has the potential to greatly speed up the design process by enabling considerable simplifications during FW simulations. The proposed method is used to design several ultralow-profile triple-layer, triple-stopband surfaces intended for Wi-Fi applications. The interlayer spacing is as low as λ/75 at the highest operating band (5.2 GHz), making the overall thickness extremely small. The unit cell size for the designs is about λ/5 at 5.2 GHz.

This paper proposes the deployment of screen printed FSS on window panes in office buildings and investigates the shielding effect on the radio wave propagation through such structures. The shielding surface is an array of modified meandered squares with a unit cell size  $0.083\lambda _{o}$ , on a flexible transparent substrate (polyethylene terephthalate) of relative permittivity 3.4. This sheet was then bonded on the window glass. With this FSS, desirable shielding is achieved in the frequency range from 1.5 to 2.5 GHz, with a potential application of shielding for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System 2 GHz frequency band, while allowing all other bands to pass with little attenuation. Investigations involved the transmission response through the unprinted and printed substrate with and without standard window size float glass. With the optimized FSS design, good agreement was achieved between the theoretical and experimental results, validating the manufactured prototype. Measurements indicate that the FSS window has approximately 38 dB better rejection in 1.5–2.5 GHz band than that of the unshielded window. However, the notch frequency depends on the permittivity and thickness of the glass, and the angle of incidence on the surface.

Model order reduction has been proposed as a systematic way to generate compact models for complex objects, by which one can then instantiate into a main FDTD mesh. However, the stability of FDTD with embedded reduced models remains an open problem. We propose a systematic method to generate reduced models for FDTD domains, and embed them into a main FDTD mesh with guaranteed stability up to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) limit of the fine mesh. With a simple perturbation technique, the CFL of the whole scheme can be further extended beyond the fine grid's CFL limit.

The floors and walls are represented as sheets of a given conductance, based on the fact that electromagnetic geophysical methods will only resolve conductive sheets in terms of their conductance as opposed to both conductivity and thickness.

Based on measured multidimensional power spectra of delay, and directions (i.e., azimuth and elevation) of departure and of arrival, multipath clusters were detected using the K-means, threshold-based, and Gaussian-mixture-model clustering algorithms. The spatial positions and directions of clusters, including the first- and last-hop scatterers, are determined using a measurement-based ray tracer method. Our experimental analysis reveals that the composite and cluster-level channel behaviors are considerably dependent on the geometry of environments, the interaction/bouncing order between a wave and objects, the position of transmitter and receiver, the underlying antenna type, and the polarimetric combination. The angular spread of arrival is observed larger than that of departure, and the characteristics for the horizontal polarization are comparable with those for vertical polarization. Our results also manifest the merits of threshold-based clustering algorithm in terms of clusters' compactness, separation, and exclusiveness. We further find that the identified interaction points exhibit excellent agreement with real physical objects existing in the environment. Based on these results, an indoor stochastic channel model is established not only for the composite parameters and cluster characteristics, but also for the first- and last-hop scatterers' position, direction, and their dispersive statistics.

With this arrangement, the correlation between two nonaligned paths of comparable length, and two aligned paths of dissimilar length, was studied. The measurements show that for the land path, the predicted ITU-R P.452-16 cumulative distribution function (CDF) typically shows 5 dB higher path loss than the actual measured CDF for the region of interest; anomalous propagation. This means that the measured signal is on average weaker than predicted (a higher path loss). For the wetland path, the actual CDF is very close to the predicted CDF.

Illumination from the sky and ground is calculated using radiation transport, as are the emissive and absorbing effects of the atmosphere between the objects and the imager. The model includes the effects of image sampling, diffraction effects of finite imager aperture sizes, and system noise. Phenomena in experimentally acquired images in the 94 GHz atmospheric transmission window are quantified from three scenarios. These are a helicopter landing site as viewed by the pilot, a coastal region showing boats, land and buildings viewed from sea level, and an airfield viewed from directly above. These are compared quantitatively to the simulated scenes from these scenarios, finding agreement between the radiation temperatures to within a few degrees kelvin. These discrepancies are accounted for by the uncertainties in the permittivities of materials in the scene.

In SSR framework, DOA estimation is accomplished by finding the sparse coefficients of the array covariance vectors in an overcomplete basis, which achieves high resolution and is statistically robust even in low signal-to-noise ratio. We use a nested sparse circular array composed of dense and sparse parts, which obtains very low MC. Thus, we propose a banded-like circulant MC matrix (MCM), which has a very few MC coefficients. By incorporating the MCM in the DOA estimation problem, the proposed array's capability of estimating more sources than sensors is improved. As compared with conventional methods, the proposed technique is cost effective and easy to implement, while achieving better performance. Simulation results show that a better underdetermined DOA estimation performance is achieved.

In three configurations, HSLA performance was also compared to that of a standard monopole antenna link. It was found that HSLA can offer up to 1450% higher throughput and can withstand much higher interference levels before the system breaks. In terms of quality, this means sustaining compressed high-definition communications. In effect, it improves the system throughput for the test 2.4 GHz (802.11b/g/n) WiFi band.

While it might be possible to manually measure that boundary in a controlled laboratory environment, this cannot be achieved in the clinical environment due to the impracticality of such a measurement in addition to the effect of the natural subject's movement. In this paper, a method for boundary identification at the same time of imaging and using the same data captured for imaging is presented. The method is based on the relation between the imaging antennas' resonant frequency and the location of the imaged object. The imaging antennas' resonant frequency shifts when that antenna faces an imaging object, which is effectively a lossy dielectric in biomedical application, and that shift depends on the distance between the antenna and the object. The proposed technique is quite fast in scanning, computation, and image creation as it does not need additional devices for accurate boundary estimation. The method is tested via simulations and human trials using a torso imaging system. The collected data across the band 0.75-1.75 GHz using a 12-element antenna array, which is extended to 24 virtual elements, enclosing the human torso are processed to successfully estimate the torso boundary in a more accurate way than other methods.

First, a mode switchable feed network which includes a set of eight L-probes was developed that facilitates the proper excitation of either the patch's TM11 or TM21 mode and yields symmetric radiation patterns. Second, their operating bands were made to overlap by augmenting this patch with an annular slot. Consequently, the radiation pattern is easily switched between the broadside and the conical modes within the overlapping operational bandwidths. A prototype was fabricated and tested. The measured results are in good agreement with their simulated values, verifying the design concepts. The measured operating bandwidth, 7.8% from 2.45 to 2.65 GHz, was determined from the overlap of the impedance and axial ratio bandwidths for both modes. The measured realized gain values are stable for both radiating states within this operational bandwidth, the broadside (conical) peak value being 8.5 dBic (5.8 dBic).

Many real materials are linear dispersive; thus, their constitutive parameters are not constant and change with frequency. However, the conventional numerical techniques are not proper tools for numerical analysis of dispersive materials, considering that they are formulated based on the assuming constant constitutive parameters for the materials. Therefore, until now, a number of numerical techniques have been proposed for modeling frequency behavior of dispersive materials. On the other hand, meshless methods are new and powerful numerical techniques which their capability in simulating the problem domain without using connection information among nodes makes them efficient techniques for modeling problems with complex geometries. In this communication, we have demonstrated that by incorporating some approaches into the meshless methods, we can turn them into suitable tools for modeling dispersive media. In order to obtain a meshless analysis of a dispersive medium, we have considered the scalar radial basis function meshless method, and for taking the frequency behavior of the medium into account, the auxiliary differential equations method has been used. Hence, the proposed dispersive meshless method not only models the frequency behavior of the dispersive materials but also provides more flexibility in simulating problems with complex geometries.

The FSS design is based on an equivalent circuit model, where the interlayer interaction is only described with a single transmission line representing the fundamental Floquet wave. A prototype of the designed FSS is fabricated, and the measured response exhibits good stability over a wide conical incidence range up to 45°. The FSS is combined with a wide-scanning connected array of dipoles to implement a phased array with integrated filtering properties. A dispersion analysis is performed to define the distance between the array and the FSS that avoids the propagation of surface waves between the combined structures, allowing to maximize the radiation efficiency. The performance of the array combined with the FSS is experimentally characterized, showing high-order harmonic rejection better than 17 dB over a large bandwidth.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2778768","Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) DO-AIO Fund; TNO V1512 Defense Radar Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8125158","Frequency selective surface (FSS);phased array antennas;spatial filters","Frequency selective surfaces;Frequency measurement;Bandwidth;Phased arrays;Metals;Harmonic analysis","","10","","13","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
