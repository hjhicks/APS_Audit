The SIW structure forms a back cavity to suppress the surface waves and separate the radiation aperture from the low-resistivity substrate. Furthermore, the side wall of the SIW cavity and the edge of the slot form a λg/4 resonator to reflect the power back to the slot loop. As a result, the radiation efficiency is improved. By etching a slot properly in the SIW upper wall, another resonating point is constructed and hence, the bandwidth is broadened.

The continuous tuning provided by the changing fluid volume allows the resonant frequency to be adjusted to any value within the tunable range. This tuning method does not affect the power handling capability of the antenna and does not consume power while the resonant frequency is kept constant. This method of tuning also stands out in its class by offering a wide tuning range, high efficiency, and very good electrical isolation between the antenna and the control circuitry. The antenna was designed and optimized using Ansys HFSS software and several prototypes were built and tested. Measured results of the input response, radiation pattern, and efficiency are presented. Castor oil (εr = 2.7) and ethyl acetate (εr = 6) were used in physical tests as the tuning fluids to verify the simulated results.

The study of the radiated fields of a circular patch antenna reveals that surface wave (SW) radiation on the edges is not the major source of a high axial ratio (AR) at grazing angles, which opposes presently accepted theory. It is shown that the AR problem originates in the different θ dependence of the intrinsic field components Eθ and Eφ. The use of a three-layer-tapered FSS in close proximity to the patch modifies Eθ and results in an acceptable AR for angles close to 90°. An AR better than 2 dB is achieved at angles beyond the horizon (θ = 90°) and in all planes at the GPS L1 frequency band (f = 1.575 GHz). This solution outperforms the techniques in literature in terms of profile, diameter, performance, and simplicity.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2491323","NSERC-AITF Research Chair Program and in part by TRTech Co.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299297","Frequency Selective Surface;Polarization Selective Surface;global navigation satellite system (GNSS);global positioning system (GPS);global axial ratio (AR);Superstrate;Frequency selective surface (FSS);global axial ratio (AR);global navigation satellite system (GNSS);global positioning system (GPS);polarization selective surface (PSS);superstrate","Patch antennas;Surface waves;Global Positioning System;Frequency selective surfaces;Simulation;Interference","","32","2","20","IEEE","15 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Circular polarization is realized by a rotationally symmetric windmill-shaped patch-aperture formation with travelling wave distribution. The physical aperture of the antenna is constituted by an opening cavity structure formed by metalized vias, which offers high-gain unidirectional radiation pattern. Measurement results of a prototype operating at 60 GHz band show a 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 17.9% (56.5-67.5 GHz), which is within its -10-dB impedance bandwidth. Meanwhile, the left-handed CP (LHCP) gain is stable throughout the operating bandwidth with a peak gain of 13.4 dBi.

This cost-effective system is designed for high-frequency applications, is capable of scanning in multiple configurations, and is able to track measurement geometry at every point in a scan. The CROMMA combines realtime six-degree-of-freedom optical spatial metrology and robotic motion to achieve antenna positioning to within 25 μm rms. A unified coordinated metrology approach is used to track all positional aspects of scanning. A vector network analyzer is used to capture amplitude and phase. We present spherical near-field measurements of the forward hemisphere of a 24-dBi standard gain horn at 183 GHz. Using the configurable scanning ability, two different scanning radii were used.

These dual-band MLWAs are able to steer the beam in forward directions in one band and in backward directions in the other band. One of the antenna designs was prototyped and tested, and excellent agreement between the predicted and measured results were observed. The measured 10-dB return loss bandwidth of the first and second bands are 19.5% (5.24-6.37 GHz) and 13.2% (7.9-9.02 GHz), respectively. The antenna can steer the main beam from 30° to 65° in the first band and from -46° to -10° in the second band by sweeping the frequency from 5.25 to 6.25 GHz and 7.75 to 9 GHz, respectively. The measured peak gain of the antenna is 12.2 and 14.1 dBi in the first and second bands, respectively. Although the antenna parameters are optimized for dual-band operation, the radiation properties in another higher frequency band (third band) are also explored.

A new strategy is also proposed to reduce the effective F/D of the focusing system and consequently the total antenna height without increasing beam distortion: a second small flat lens is added on top of the primary feed to create a virtual focus located well below the feed phase center. The challenge is to conciliate high gain both with wide beam scanning and reduced antenna height.

Accordingly, we employ a traveling wave array (TWA) using a single feedline whose propagation constant is controlled via a single, small, and mechanical movement of a dielectric plunger to enable scanning. The dielectric plunger is positioned within a parallel plate waveguide (PPW) transmission line (TL) that feeds the TWA. By adjusting the position of the dielectric plunger within the TL, the feedline achieves a propagation constant range of 1 ≤ keff/k0 ≤ 2.1, corresponding to scan angles of -32.6° ≤ θ ≤ 34.2° with an element spacing of d = 0.65λ0. That is, beam steering is achieved using a single feed and a simple linear mechanical movement (for any size array) without using phase shifters.

A metasurface is an artificial surface composed of electrically small scatterers. Of late, metasurfacing has been an emerging and promising technique for controlling wave propagation. Traditional metasurfaces mainly employ surface reactances and generally reflect waves when manipulating wave transmission or refraction. In this paper, a passive metasurface employing both surface reactance and positive surface resistance is proposed, which can not only manipulate wave transmission magnitude and phase independently and fully but also suppress wave reflection simultaneously. Furthermore, reflectionless refraction can also be achieved with the proposed passive metasurface. The complete design theory is established for the passive metasurface. Theoretical analysis, prototypes, simulation, and experimental validation are demonstrated. The reflectionless feature of a passive metasurface is important for avoiding multiple wave reflections and interference between stages in EM systems.

We develop new techniques capable of analyzing the dynamic structure of generic antenna-antenna interactions by describing how energy exchange is divided between propagating and nonpropagating parts in a way reflecting the geometrical shapes and interelement distances of the coupled antennas. The proposed method is implemented through a special method-of-moment (MoM) numerical model and is used to give information about how energy is localized between antennas or electromagnetic objects, which is directly related to the physics of complex systems and the problem of energy storage, transfer, and manipulations. The work utilizes some recent developments in which a spectral near-field theory and the antenna current Green's function formalism were proposed to analyze and describe general electromagnetic systems. The present formulation is developed in conjunction with the special MoM implementation to generate various numerical illustrations and new field energy density pictures combined with analysis of the physics of near-field coupling as revealed through the new results. The technique realized here can be easily integrated into existing full-wave solvers such as MoM to provide systematic pictures of near-field interactions and coupling with more comprehensive and detailed information compared with conventional port parameters such as the S-matrix. The method is suitable for applications such as near-field detection, energy transfer, and near-field communications, besides its fundamental importance for mutual coupling in antenna arrays in general.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2486804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7289393","Mutual coupling;near field;energy transfer;Energy transfer;mutual coupling;near field","Antennas;Method of moments;Energy exchange;Couplings;Green's function methods;Mutual coupling;Antenna measurements","","18","","29","IEEE","5 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The generalized DOFs are supported by enriched vector basis functions (VBFs), which are constructed through a linear combination of the VBFs from the subelements. Several verification examples are provided to show that the IGFEM is not sensitive to the quality of the subelements and maintains the same level of solution accuracy and computational complexity as the standard finite-element method (FEM) based on conformal meshes.

The method relies on using characteristic modes (CM) as macro basis functions and reusing the dominant CM of the resonant element for all elements in the reflectarray. This utilization leads to obtaining a reduced matrix system where the number of unknowns is drastically decreased. As far as the far field is concerned, accurate results are achieved even with a single CM. The accuracy is attained owing to preservation of mutual coupling information via the original method of moments (MoM) impedance matrix. The solution is further accelerated by tabulating the entries of the reduced matrix as a function of interacting patch sizes and their relative displacements. It is observed that for sufficiently separated patches, the reduced matrix entry is almost a separable function of the two-dimensional (2-D) displacement between patches and patch sizes associated with the matrix entry. Tabulation is efficiently performed by exploiting this fact. Achieved acceleration is sufficient to use this analysis method in the design of reflectarrays. For a 1000-element array, the tabulation process takes 28 min on a platform with 3.3 GHz CPU clock speed. With the lookup table at hand, the solution time is 0.38 s which is important for the design iterations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2489644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296626","Reflectarray;analysis;efficient numerical solution;Analysis;efficient numerical solution;reflectarray","Finite element analysis;Arrays;Method of moments;Approximation methods;Reflector antennas;Mutual coupling;Antenna arrays","","18","","21","IEEE","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two situations are considered. 1) The skin depth is smaller than the thickness of the conductive volume. 2) The skin depth is larger than the thickness of a thin conductive sheet. For the first situation, a surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC) is employed, wherein the surface impedance usually exhibits a complex relation with the frequency. To incorporate the SIBC into DGTD, the surface impedance is first approximated by rational functions in the Laplace domain using the fast relaxation vector-fitting (FRVF) technique. Via inverse Laplace transform, the time-domain DGTD matrix equations can be obtained conveniently in integral form with respect to time t. For the second situation, a transmission IBC (TIBC) is used to include the transparent effects of the fields. In the TIBC, the tangential magnetic field jump is related with the tangential electric field via the surface conductivity. In this work, a specifically designed DGTD algorithm with TIBC is developed to model the graphene up to the terahertz (THz) band. In order to incorporate the TIBC into DGTD without involving the time-domain convolution, an auxiliary surface polarization current governed by a first-order differential equation is introduced over the graphene. For open-region scattering problems, the DGTD algorithm is further hybridized with the time-domain boundary integral (TDBI) method to rigorously truncate the computational domain. To demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed algorithm, several representative examples are provided.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2491969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299647","Auxiliary differential equation (ADE);discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method;finite integral technique (FIT);graphene;surface/transmission impedance boundary condition (SIBC/TIBC);time-domain boundary integral (TDBI) algorithm;vector-fitting;Auxiliary differential equation (ADE);discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method;finite integral technique (FIT);graphene;surface/transmission impedance boundary condition (SIBC/TIBC);time-domain boundary integral (TDBI) algorithm;vector-fitting","Surface impedance;Time-domain analysis;Graphene;Impedance;Face recognition;Integral equations","","40","","39","OAPA","16 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a consequence, the number of matrix-vector products is significantly reduced during the iterative resolution. Then, this paper proves that the ACA can be applied and efficiently implemented in IE-DDM methods. Moreover, a hierarchical LU (HLU) decomposition is proposed to accelerate the ACA solver.

Then, the Fourier-domain surface fields are derived using a perturbation method. The scattered fields are subsequently determined by a second application of SEP.

The 2×2 polarization matrix of each MPC is represented by the geometrical parameters of two ellipses, i.e., the ovality, tilt angle, and size of each ellipse, as well as the rotating direction of electric field intensity along the ellipse. The statistics of these parameters including correlation behaviors among them extracted from measurement data constitute the stochastic polarization model for the propagation scenario of interest. Analytical expressions are presented for the transformation from the ellipse parameters to the 2×2 polarization matrix, and vice versa. Comparing with conventional polarization models addressing merely the cross-polarization ratios, the new model provides a more complete description for the per-path polarizations in terms of the power imbalance, tilting, and polarization spread. Furthermore, based on multiple-input multiple-output channel measurement data collected with 100-MHz bandwidth and at the center frequency of 5.25 GHz, stochastic polarization models of the proposed structure are extracted for five indoor scenarios. These models are complementary to the existing geometry-based stochastic channel models for generating realistic polarization matrices for MPCs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2486798","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471268); Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61331009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7289360","Wideband propagation channel;polarization ellipse;high-resolution parameter estimation;and geometry-based stochastic channel model;Geometry-based stochastic channel model;high-resolution parameter estimation;polarization ellipse;wideband propagation channel","Stochastic processes;Standards;MIMO;Antenna arrays;Trajectory;Channel models;Receiving antennas","","12","","41","OAPA","5 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on a segmentation of the excited current distribution on the antenna body by a finite number of small electric dipoles. To consider the presence of the human body, which affects the underlying radiation mechanism significantly, the model is implemented by the use of the Norton surface wave theory. Based thereon, a method is presented to model the on-body far field of an antenna by two equivalent electric dipoles: 1) a TM and 2) a TE source. Based on this assumption, the directivity and the effective antenna area are defined for on-body propagation scenarios. The radiation characteristic of body worn antennas is discussed in terms of their radiation characteristic using the example of tilted half-wave dipoles and a planar inverted-F antenna. The last part of the study discusses a pathloss model which is calculated from the underlying antenna parameters. Numerical full-wave simulations, based on the FDTD method, and measurements in an anechoic chamber, verify the results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2482499","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(grant numbers:MA 4981/6-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7277023","Body area networks;antenna theory;on-body directivity;on-body propagation;wearable antennas;Antenna theory;body area networks;on-body directivity;on-body propagation;wearable antennas","Dipole antennas;Surface waves;Antenna theory;Surface impedance;Mathematical model;Optical surface waves","","14","","18","IEEE","25 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective of the weighted I1 optimization is to minimize the number of radiating elements. For the filter-and-sum beamforming structure, this is equivalent to minimizing the number of filters, each with a set of optimized coefficients. The multiple constraints are adopted to individually control the mainlobe and sidelobe pattern characteristics, so as to preserve the FI property in the mainlobe region while satisfying a given upper bound in the sidelobe region. The WNG constraint can also be incorporated into the proposed method to enhance the synthesis robustness. This method can be easily implemented by iterative second-order cone programming (SOCP), and only few iterations are required to reach the convergence. A set of examples for the synthesis of FI patterns with uniform sidelobe level (SLL) or multiple nulls, scannable FI patterns, and the synthesis of FI pattern for an arc array with directive elements, is presented to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.

Three shorting pins and a U-slot are embedded in the driven patch to enhance out-of-band suppression levels and skirt selectivity near the lower band-edge, whereas the stacked patch provides a sharp roll-off rate at the upper band-edge and also an enhanced gain.

This is primarily because the electric field integral equation (EFIE) matrix, even with cutting-edge preconditioning techniques, often exhibits bad spectral properties arising from frequency or geometry-based ill-conditioning, which render iterative solvers slow to converge or stagnate occasionally. In this communication, a novel technique to expedite the convergence of MoM matrix solution at a specific frequency is proposed, by extracting and applying Eigen-vectors from a previously solved neighboring frequency in an augmented generalized minimum residual (AGMRES) iterative framework. This technique can be applied in unison with any preconditioner. Numerical results demonstrate up to 40% speed-up in convergence using the proposed Eigen-AGMRES method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2481478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274655","Augmented Generalized Minimum Residual (AGMRES);Iterative solver;Electric Field Integral Equation;Augmented generalized minimum residual (AGMRES);electric field integral equation (EFIE);iterative solver","Method of moments;Convergence;Antennas;Time-frequency analysis;Electric fields;Integral equations;Algorithm design and analysis","","1","","23","IEEE","23 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
