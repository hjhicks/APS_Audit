This partially-reflecting surface can be obtained using a dielectric superstrate or via a capacitive or inductive metasurface (MTS). By using an equivalence between the conventional dielectric superstrate and the MTS-based structures in terms of the dominant TE/TM modes, we show that the use of inductive grid MTSs leads to a directivity enhancement. A higher roll-of in the radiation patterns is achieved as a result of the intrinsic suppression of the spurious TM0 leaky wave mode. This suppression is mathematically demonstrated and validated with full-wave simulations. The achieved improvement in more than 1 dB for inductive strip grid based MTS with respect to dielectric based super-layers, for the same frequency band of 2.5%, is verified with measurements.

The antenna mainly acts like an inverted-F antenna (IFA) at frequencies in the LTE low and middle bands and like a loop antenna at frequencies in the LTE high band. The reconfigurable IFA/loop antenna is achieved without active switch circuits and occupies a small volume of 10 ×35 ×3 mm3. The antenna is obtained by first configuring the radiating arm of an IFA to be folded and coupled to the device ground plane through a distributed capacitor. Then, the IFA's shorting and feeding strips are respectively loaded with an inductor and a capacitor. This leads to good excitation of a resonant mode generated in the LTE low band with the radiating arm length of the IFA only about 0.16 wavelength at 800 MHz. By further aided using a high-pass matching circuit integrated within the antenna, a wide low band is obtained for the antenna. The IFA's first two higher-order modes can also be excited in the middle band. Owing to the distributed capacitor between the IFA's radiating arm and the device ground plane, the two higher-order modes can lead to a wide middle band for the antenna. At frequencies in the LTE high band, the antenna mainly acts like a loop antenna operated at its one-wavelength loop mode, which contributes to a wide high band for the antenna. Triple-wideband operation covering the LTE operation is hence obtained. Details of the proposed antenna are described, and experimental results are presented.

Firstly, our study demonstrates that circular polarization can be achieved at the broadside by setting a 90° phase difference between the vertical and horizontal paired-dipoles. Secondly, the principle of wide-beamwidth circularly-polarized radiation is described under the similarity in polar and azimuthal radiation pattern for a pair of parallel dipoles. After the spacing between two parallel dipoles is studied, the similar radiation patterns in these two orthogonal planes are derived. As such, a wide-beamwidth circular polarization can be achieved by placing the two pairs of parallel dipoles vertically and horizontally while setting a 90° phase difference between them. In final, a circularly-polarized printed antenna is designed and fabricated on a single dielectric substrate. The two arms of its four dipoles are formed on the lower and upper interfaces of the substrate, and they are excited by a 1-to-4 probe-to-microstrip feeding network.

The dual varactors provide a large tuning range (410-990 MHz, 2.1-3.5 GHz; VSWR = 2:1), while the single bias voltage applied to both varactors greatly simplifies the bias network. The introduction of the bias through the RF feed eliminates the need for separate bias lines. As a result, when the electrical size of the antenna is decreased through tuning, undesired bias line coupling and radiation effects are nonexistent. The design highlights the radiation efficiency limitations associated with the desirable planar topology for electrically small antennas with very wide tuning range requirements.

The proposed antenna produces a localized specific absorption rate pattern at the desired frequency of operation without using a coaxial balun. This reduces the outer diameter of the antenna and, thus, its invasiveness. Balun-free operation of the proposed antenna is achieved by operating the helical antenna at the second resonant frequency of the helix where a current minimum occurs at the feed point, resulting in an intrinsically high feed-point impedance. This efficiently chokes the currents excited on the outer surface of the feeding cable. Using a compact quarter-wavelength impedance transformer or a coaxially implemented pi network of reactive elements at the antenna feed point, we achieve an excellent impedance match between the antenna and the main feeding line. We fabricated a prototype of the proposed helical antenna with an outer diameter of 2.2 mm using the pi matching network. We used this prototype to conduct ablation experiments in ex vivo bovine liver. The dimensions of the resulting ablation zones are similar to those produced by coaxially fed antennas that use coaxial baluns. Our balun-free antenna design offers a promising solution for reducing the invasiveness of interstitial antennas used in microwave ablation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2389223","Vietnam Education Foundation Fellowship; Philip D.

This is especially true when considering cylindrical microstrip antennas (CMAs). In the cylindrical case, the calculation of the two-dimensional Green's functions stays inherently time-consuming. In the planar case, Green's function can be reduced to a one-dimensional function. The problem, however, becomes a real bottle-neck when probe feeding of a CMA is considered, as the traditional IFT used to calculate the excitation in the spatial domain results in a huge IFT time. In this paper, this problem is explicitly treated. The asymptotical behavior of the probe-related spectral Green's functions (GFs) is rigorously derived, subtracted, and the corresponding reaction integrals are inverse Fourier transformed without the occurrence of any cylindrical functions. This results in a much improved calculation efficiency for this type of feeding, evident for both thin and thick substrates.

"HF Band Shipboard Antenna Design Using Characteristic Modes","Y. Chen; C. -F.

How to design conformal or even platform-embedded HF antennas raises us a new challenging topic. This paper proposes an approach to address such challenging problem through the combination of the characteristic mode (CM) theory with the structural antenna concept. 1) The CMs are solved to understand the resonant behavior of the ship platform. 2) We synthesize the radiating currents for designated radiation pattern by making use of the CMs of the ship platform. It allows the dominant radiating currents to locally distribute on the superstructure of the ship. Consequently, the superstructure becomes the main radiator. The modal solutions in CM theory ensure the efficiency of the synthesis procedure. 3) Nonprotruding slits are proposed to excite the synthesized currents.

As an example, HF antenna on a realistic ship with broadside radiation pattern is designed.

Tuning of the resonance frequency is achieved by using a metallic MEMS bridge over the slot. The bridge acts as a capacitive load, increasing the equivalent capacitance, and so decreasing the resonance frequency. Electromagnetic and electromechanical simulations are performed to investigate the designed FSS. S-parameter measurements of the FSS unit cell are performed in a waveguide simulator, showing more than 1.7 GHz frequency shift in the X-band, achieved by using only one MEMS bridge. A measured bandwidth of 400 MHz at the resonance frequency of 9.59 GHz is achieved. The designed MEMS bridge benefits from an unconventional method of using SU-8 as the sacrificial layer, resulting in low loss at high frequencies (3.2 dB loss at the resonance frequency of 9.59 GHz). Devices with different heights of the MEMS bridge were fabricated to study the variation in the resonance frequency. The MEMS bridge was tested at fixed heights. Simulated and measured results show excellent agreement. An FSS array is designed based on the FSS unit cell results. The design procedure to maximize the quality factor and controllable frequency range, and improve the radiation characteristics of the FSS array is discussed. Further simulations are performed to examine the performance of the FSS array with regards to grating lobes, oblique incidence and tunability.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2386304","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6998951","Frequency selective surfaces;microelectromechanical systems;RF MEMS;spatial filters;SU-8;tunable frequency selective surface (FSS)","Frequency selective surfaces;Bridge circuits;Micromechanical devices;Resonant frequency;Substrates;Capacitance;Reflection","","81","2","17","IEEE","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using Floquet modal theory, the induced electric and magnetic fields on the apertures of all the elements of the array produced by an excited element are determined. Equivalence principle is then invoked to obtain the active element pattern (AEP) of the excited element. The AEP is found to vary substantially with the location of the element. In particular, the E-plane pattern of an element near the edge has a tilted beam, which is conspicuously different from that of the center element. The beam-tilt is explained from the “reverse phase” of a leaky wave in an array. Numerical results compare well with available measured data for open-ended waveguide and patch arrays. Also, a rigorous method of moment (MoM) analysis agrees favorably with the present model. One of the key features of the model is that it allows array pattern computation without much additional computational efforts. From array analysis, it is observed that the null depth at the blind spot is reduced as the array size shrinks and for very small arrays, the blind spot disappears. The scan loss is found to vary significantly with the array size particularly near the blind spot.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2389249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004804","Finite array;Edge element pattern;Active element pattern;Scan loss;Leaky wave;Mutual Coupling;Floquet modes;Active element pattern (AEP);edge element pattern;finite array;Floquet modes;leaky wave;mutual coupling;scan loss","Arrays;Finite element analysis;Apertures;Method of moments;Manganese;Computational modeling;Electric fields","","10","","20","IEEE","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Whatever the elements disposal and the array boundary, the overall problem is solved through a convex (quadratic) programming procedure. Moreover, if centrosymmetric antenna layouts are adopted, the synthesis is reduced to an even more powerful linear programming routine which preserves the solution uniqueness and optimality guaranteed by quadratic programming codes while dramatically decreasing their computational weight (and hence enabling the design of much larger planar arrays). The proposed approach also takes into account the need of reducing the complexity of the beam forming network (BFN), which is fulfilled by sharing part of the excitation amplitudes between the two radiation modalities.

These include the common mode and the differential modes of excitation. This new array offers an enhanced phase response compared to the regular antenna array that occupies the same aperture. However, unlike previous BMAA designs, the output power of the array does not need to be sacrificed to achieve this phase enhancement factor. Compared to a regular array, this two-element coupled array extracts the same amount of power from an incoming electromagnetic wave but provides a considerably larger phase sensitivity. The paper describes the theory of operation and the design process of this antenna.

The sum of these constituent expansions is equal to the original total radiation field. The purpose of such a resolution is to separate the radiation fields due to two identified parts of the original antenna which together constitute the entire radiating structure. Once the resolution has been accomplished, one may study the radiation from the currents on the two parts of the antenna individually including mutual interaction to all orders. This is to be distinguished from measurement of the radiation fields of the two parts individually because that measurement does not include the mutual interaction. A demonstration measurement of a two antenna system is described and iterative postmeasurement processing is employed to identify the radiation from currents on the two constituent antennas of the overall radiating structure.

The basic idea of the design is the development of a canonical two-port antenna that can be replicated and concatenated together to form MIMO antennas with arbitrary even numbers of ports. The design of the canonical element uses compact folded slots for the radiating elements but includes the use of field cancelation to enhance isolation by incorporating a coupling parasitic element. In addition by properly designing the coupling parasitic and the two-port antenna, coupling between canonical elements is also reduced allowing them to be concatenated together. The canonical element size is 27.5 × 30 mm2 operating at 2.6 GHz and it can be packed together with high densities of up to 22 elements per square wavelength. To validate the design, results from 20-port planar printed MIMO antennas are presented operating at 2.6 GHz with a bandwidth of 100 MHz. The 20-port antenna has size of 1.3λ0 × 0.69λ0 mm2 providing an antenna density of 22 antenna in free space square wavelength (λ02). Even though the individual antennas are densely packed, all combinations of mutual couplings between ports exhibit better than 10 dB isolation. The antennas are printed on an FR-4 printed circuit board (PCB), which is a low-cost substrate and allows straightforward prototyping.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2389242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004819","Multiple-input-multiple- mutual coupling;parasitic element;printed slot antenna;Multiple-input-multiple- mutual coupling;parasitic element;printed slot antenna","Couplings;MIMO;Slot antennas;Mutual coupling;Scattering parameters;Ports (Computers)","","121","","39","IEEE","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The unit cell comprises a double layer nested ring-split ring structure realized as microfluidic channels embedded in Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using soft lithography techniques. Conductive regions of the rings are formed by injecting a liquid metal (an alloy of Ga, In, and Sn), whereas the split region is air. Movement of the liquid metal together with the split around the ring provides 360 ° linear phase shift range in the transmitted field through the unit cell. A circularly polarized unit cell is designed to operate at 8.8 GHz, satisfying the necessary phase shifting conditions provided by the element rotation method. Unit cell prototypes are fabricated and the proposed concept is verified by the measurements using waveguide simulator method, within the frequency range of 8-10 GHz. The agreement between the simulation and measurement results is satisfactory, illustrating the viability of the approach to be used in reconfigurable antennas and antenna arrays.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2387424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001241","Beam steering;circularly polarized;element rotation method;lens array;liquid metal;microfluidics;reconfigurable;split ring;transmitarray","Metals;Liquids;Microfluidics;Glass;Antenna arrays;Fabrication;Insertion loss","","46","","17","IEEE","5 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed EBG structures employ two closely coupled arrays, one comprising linear conducting patches and the other comprising apertures (slits) in the ground plane. The two arrays are printed on either side of a very thin dielectric layer (55 μm) with a rotation between the elements to produce maximum coupling for miniaturizing. A microstrip line excitation is initially used for the efficient analysis and design of the slit-patch EBG structures, which are subsequently employed between two UWB printed monopoles. The proposed EBG structure has a small footprint and produces a significant reduction of the mutual coupling across the wide operating band of the UWB antennas. Simulated results and measurements of fabricated prototypes are presented.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2387871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001573","Electromagnetic band gap;Mutual coupling;miniaturization;MIMO antennas;Electromagnetic band gap (EBG);miniaturization;multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antennas;mutual coupling","Antenna arrays;Periodic structures;Metamaterials;Antenna measurements;Mutual coupling;Ultra wideband antennas","","178","","13","IEEE","6 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To get a well-posed equation, a temporally differentiated form of the TD-EFIE is tested with the flower function and the undifferentiated form is tested with the loop function. For a robust MOT solver, the averaging scheme is also adopted to alleviate the high-frequency instabilities.
