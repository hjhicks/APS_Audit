The beam steering is realized by employing a reconfigurable PRS structure to achieve a changeable reflection phase as well as using a phased array as the source to excite the PRS antenna. A prototype antenna including the biasing network is fabricated and measured. It achieves a consistent beam steering from - 15° to 15° with respect to the broadside direction across an overlapped frequency range from 5.5 to 5.7 GHz with measured realized gains over 12 dBi. Good agreement between the simulated and measured results for the input reflection coefficients and radiation patterns is achieved, which validates the feasibility of the design principle.

Both the transverse and vertical components of the mixed-potential Green's functions due to a 1-D phased array of dipoles in a layered medium are accelerated using suitable homogeneous-medium asymptotic extractions from the standard spectral series of Floquet harmonics. A novel acceleration procedure is applied for the computation of the vertical potentials whose extracted terms can be expressed as potentials from a 1-D phased array of half-line sources in a homogeneous medium. Their numerical calculation requires a suitable modification of the Ewald method, thus resulting in new modified spectral and spatial series, having Gaussian convergence even in the case of complex modes and improper harmonics.

The PT antenna technology has attracted much attention in the areas of biomedical, environmental, and military applications. It is also a fundamental building block of transient communications, where certain components of the communication link are degradable. In this paper, we revisit the classical antenna figures-of-merit such as resonant frequency and input impedance, and propose a novel immersion-time-dependent description framework to characterize this class of antennas, taking into account their PT nature. Subsequently, we present the notions of average and outage antenna characteristics over all realizations of the random antenna degeneration process occurring in a solvent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the open literature to quantify stochastically the properties of a PT antenna.

The ceramic slab is smoothly tapered to transform the guided surface wave into radiated space wave over a wide frequency range. The surface wave launcher employs a probe-fed parallel plate waveguide with a modified parabolic reflecting wall and a metallic post, which are critical for effectively transforming the cylindrical waves to a unidirectional plane wave within a broad frequency range. Simulated results show that the proposed surface wave antenna achieves a wide operation bandwidth from 6.1 to 18 GHz with a thickness of only ${\bf 0}.{\bf 12}{\lambda _0}$ at the center frequency.

The technique is applied to leaky-wave impedance surfaces. A homogenized model for an impedance surface is used so that the work is not limited to particular geometries. The model consists of a grounded, uniaxial dielectric substrate topped by a reactance sheet. To synthesize prescribed aperture fields, the leakage constant α|| and phase constant β|| along the antenna are tailored. The aperture field is determined by adapting the Orchard-Elliott method used in array synthesis to continuous line sources. The aperture field is related to α|| and β|| using a well-known approach, then the transverse resonance technique is employed to analytically relate α|| and β|| to the electrical parameters of the impedance surface. Specifically, the extraordinary index and sheet reactance are used to control α|| and β||. The designs presented demonstrate the synthesis of a variety of far-field patterns. Full-wave simulations show an improvement over previous beam synthesis techniques based on geometrical optics.

The effect of beamformer coefficients and antenna coupling on Teff is analyzed in a manner similar to a stand-alone LNA analysis. This leads to the proposed LNA design strategy of selecting LNA Γopt near the reflection coefficient of antenna ports and selecting the largest practical |S11| with a proper phase. This strategy is based on the assumption that the antenna array may be used for various beamforming and nonbeamforming applications, unknown at the time of the design. Numerical simulations of a 38- and 41-element antenna arrays show that a global search of LNA S11 and Γopt, which result in the minimum average beam-equivalent receiver noise temperature Trec, finds nearly identical results to the proposed LNA design strategy.

These eigenvectors correspond to the Bloch modes of the periodic structure. The eigenvector related to the propagating Bloch mode directly yields an expression for the effective, intrinsic wave impedance of the medium. Moreover, the interface between the artificial material and a surrounding, conventional (dielectric) region is described by an interface impedance matrix which accounts for the excitation of higher order, nonpropagating Bloch modes at the interface. Although these modes do not propagate into the bulk of the artificial material, they affect the reflection and transmission coefficients of incident waves. From the bulk and surface impedances derived, and with the aid of a simple transmission line model, the scattering parameters of a slab of an artificial medium are computed.

An optimization procedure based on a holographic approach is used for tuning the position and size of the slots of the RLSA. The antenna is centrally fed by a coaxial probe transition.

However, since the computational domain includes both the antennas and the propagation environment, their coupling prevents evaluating individual contributions to the channel response. As a result, the simulation becomes always specific to the given antenna type or orientation and cannot be reused for other configurations. The simulation also requires the internal structure of the antenna which is often unavailable and/or difficult to be modeled. These problems can be addressed by antenna de-embeddeding which separately models the antenna and the propagation environment, hence the purpose of this paper. In particular, this paper proposes the implementation of spherical-wave-function (SWF) channel modeling using the FDTD method. Instead of modeling the real antenna structures inside the computational domain, the single-mode spherical wave source and the observation points are utilized. The spherical wave source is achieved by a cubical dipole array. The spherical wave source is first validated, including the investigation of the effects of cell and array size. The narrowband channel response synthesized by the proposed approach is then validated numerically through comparison with the transmission formula in free space and the conventional antenna-embedded simulation in the human shadowing environment as well.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2414442","Scientific Research (B)(grant numbers:22360150); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); JSPS Fellows(grant numbers:25008831); Japan-Finland Bilateral Core Program “Improving the quality of medical treatment and daily health-care: an approach from wireless communications and networks”; JSPS and the Academy of Finland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063244","Radio Propagation;FDTD Method;Spherical Wave Function;Antenna De-embedding;Antenna de-embedding;finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method;radio propagation;spherical wave function","Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Arrays;Finite difference methods;Computational modeling","","17","","29","IEEE","18 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The solution to the periodic multilayered problem has been traditionally carried out by means of the Galerkin's version of the method of moments (MoM) in the spectral domain. This approach involves the computation of double infinite summations, and whereas some of these summations converge very fast, some other converge very slowly. In this paper, the slowly convergent summations are computed by making use of an enhanced mixed potential integral equation (MPIE) formulation of the MoM in the spatial domain. This enhanced formulation is based on the interpolation of the multilayered periodic Green's functions, and on the efficient computation of the four-dimensional (4-D) integrals leading to the MoM matrix entries. Both the novel hybrid spectral-spatial MoM code and the standard spectral domain MoM code have been used for the design of a contoured beam reflectarray antenna. It has been verified that the spectral-spatial MoM code requires CPU times that are typically 30 times smaller than those required by the pure spectral domain MoM code.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2416753","Junta de Andaluca(grant numbers:P12-TIC-1435); European Space Agency under ESTEC(grant numbers:4000106334); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(grant numbers:CICYT TEC2013-43345-P,CICYT TEC2013-41913-P); Consolider Ingenio 2010(grant numbers:CSD2008-00066,CSD2008-00068); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070684","Multilayered media;integral equations;moment methods;Green’s functions;periodic structures;reflectarrays;Green’s functions;integral equations;moment methods;multilayered media;periodic structures;reflectarrays","Method of moments;Green's function methods;Spectral analysis;Periodic structures;Antenna arrays;Niobium;Substrates","","29","","39","IEEE","27 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main difference between 60 and 70 GHz channels lies in power levels of the specular propagation paths and diffuse scattering which affect their visibility over the noise level in the measurements, and the speed of power decay as the propagation delay increases. Having defined the channel model framework, a set of model parameters has been derived for each scenario at the two radio frequencies. After specifying the implementation recipe of the proposed channel model, channel model outputs are compared with the measurements to show validity of the channel model framework and implementation. Validity was demonstrated through objective parameters, i.e., pathloss and root-mean-square delay spread, which were not used as defining parameters of the channel model.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2412147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058398","Millimeter-wave;short-range communications;channel model;Channel model;millimeter-wave;short-range communications","Delays;Antenna measurements;Channel models;Antennas;Gain;Frequency measurement","","116","","25","IEEE","11 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the discrete sampling of the space, the ray tracing method is time-consuming in obtaining accurate results. In this paper, an accurate and efficient GPU-based kD-tree-accelerated beam-tracing method (GKBT), designed to run on GPU in parallel, is proposed, which overcomes the discrete sampling artifacts of ray tracing methods. The proposed method contains both an efficient beam-triangle intersection algorithm based on Pluecker coordinates and a kD-tree traversal algorithm extended to beam tracing to dramatically reduce the computation time. The simulated result shows great agreement with the measured result published in literature. Numerical experiments show that the GKBT is about ten times faster than the state-of-the-art ray tracing method.

These include the effects of indoor penetration through walls and obstacles, as well as indoor/outdoor cases, for both line of sight (LoS) and nonLoS (NLoS), at ranges up to 200 m.

Based on statistical tests, we show that the measured channels have a nearly ideal scalar attenuation and delay transfer function, with minimal phase distortion, and little to no evidence of multipath propagation.

The proposed configuration is much advantageous in terms of design, simplicity, structural stability, fabrication, and cost without compromising in gain, efficiency, and bandwidth. A probe-fed dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) with εr = 10 has been used as the primary radiator. Proposed RCA bearing overall size 1.1λ × 1.1λ × 0.6λ promises for large impedance bandwidth (~23%) with considerably high gain (11.8-12.2 dBi). The superstrate size is relatively compact compared to its semitransparent versions, investigated earlier. Present design has been experimentally validated indicating as much as 12 dBi peak gain with more than 96.5% efficiency.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2415518","Center of Advanced Study in Radio Physics and Electronics, University of Calcutta; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065211","Resonance cavity antenna;resonance gain antenna;dielectric resonator antenna;high gain antenna;Dielectric resonator antenna (DRA);high-gain antenna;resonance cavity antenna (RCA);resonance gain antenna","Gain;Cavity resonators;Metals;Antennas;Dielectrics;Microstrip;Bandwidth","","54","","26","IEEE","23 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dual-polarized antenna structure is achieved by inserting two orthogonal Vivaldi antennas in a cross-shaped form without a galvanic contact. The measured -10 dB impedance bandwidth (S11) is approximately from 0.7 up to 7.30 GHz, corresponding to a 166% relative frequency bandwidth. The isolation (S21) between the antenna ports is better than 30 dB, and the measured maximum gain is 3.8-11.2 dB at the aforementioned frequency bandwidth. Orthogonal polarizations have the same maximum gain within the 0.7-3.6 GHz band, and a slight variation up from 3.6 GHz. The cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) is better than 19 dB across the measured 0.7-6.0 GHz frequency bandwidth, and better than 25 dB up to 4.5 GHz.

Therefore, the concept of local phase center (LPC) has been used. Two algorithms of LPC hodograph computation are presented and verified by comparison with analytical results. Even in the simplest case of two sources, a curve of the LPC hodograph may be curious and hardly predictable. This is particularly true if a special phase pattern arises, e.g., as a result of the desired amplitude pattern synthesis. Two examples with sector and secant patterns are studied and the relevant LPC-hodographs are demonstrated. All calculations prove that the LPC is unexpectedly well defined.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2417894","Kazan National Research Technical University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073584","Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna synthesis;Hodograph;Phase centre;Antenna arrays;antenna radiation patterns;antenna synthesis;hodograph;phase center","Approximation methods;Phased arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Global Positioning System","","3","","12","IEEE","31 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When combined with four-substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) slot antennas as the primary feeds, the transmit-array is able to generate four beams with a specific coverage of ±15°. The simulated and measured results of the antenna prototype at 76.5 GHz agree well, with gain greater than 18.5 dBi.
