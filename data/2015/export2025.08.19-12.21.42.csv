Four different lengths of meander strips connected to the four edges of the square patch of a single coaxial-feed square patch antenna are folded to obtain a circularly polarized antenna. Properly positioning the coaxial feed on the square patch excites two orthogonal resonant modes with a 90 ° phase difference and achieves a pure circular polarization. Conventional antennas for roof-mounted vehicle communication devices use commercially available ceramic corner-truncated patches whereas the proposed GPS antenna is designed to use a less expensive and more compact FR4 patch. Experiments also showed that mounting the proposed GPS antenna in different locations on the roof of a vehicle had little effect on circular polarization radiation. The fabricated prototype revealed an impedance bandwidth of 2.1% and a 3-dB axial-ratio bandwidth approximating 0.76% at a GPS frequency of 1575 MHz. Experiments confirmed that the characteristics of the proposed antenna were consistent with the simulation results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2382680","National Science Council of Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990547","Circular polarization (CP) radiation;circularly polarized antenna;folded patch antenna;global positioning system;vehicle communication devices","Resonant frequency;Global Positioning System;Patch antennas;Vehicles;Polarization;Substrates","","22","","17","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The FSSs are designed to, respectively, transmit TE and TM waves within the same transmission frequency range, so that the combined structure is transparent to all polarizations in this band. Likewise, the two arrays are designed to, respectively, reflect TE and TM incident waves in a common reflection band, so that all polarizations are fully reflected in this range; if the separation of the two arrays is such that the TE and TM components of an incident wave polarized at slant 45° experience a 90° phase shift, reflection will occur in CP.

Based on modulating rectangular pulses and trapezoidal pulses, the theories of generating a scanning beam at the single positive sideband are presented. It was found that using trapezoidal pulse modulation can obtain excellent performance in power efficiency and undesired sideband level than using rectangular pulse modulation. Unlike conventional time-modulated antenna array where each array element is connected to a RF switch, in the proposed scheme, each element is connected to an I/Q channel modulator which is composed of two Wilkinson power dividers, two RF switches, two 0/π phase shifters in RF channels, and one π/2 fixed-phase shifter in the control circuit. By properly controlling both the phase shifters and the switches in time domain, the single-sideband modulation can be realized with the uniform amplitude and variable phase in frequency domain. The I/Q modulator acts as a phase shifter and can be used to form a phased array. In this paper, the main efforts have been paid to find the pulse sequences to suppress the spurious bands. To validate the proposed technique, simulated results of an eight-element single-sideband time-modulated linear array obtained from the array factor and full-wave analysis are reported. In the case of using rectangular pulses, the power efficiency of the scanning beam is 91.47% and the peak level of the highest undesired harmonic is -13.98 dB. In the case of using trapezoidal pulses, the best values can reach 99.79% and -27.98 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2406890","The National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7047828","In-phase/quadrature complex modulation;single-sideband time-modulated phase-only weighting;phased array;time-modulation technique;In-phase/quadrature (I/Q) complex modulation;phased array;single-sideband time-modulated phase-only weighting;time-modulation (TM) technique","Arrays;Switches;Harmonic analysis;Amplitude modulation;Phase shifters;Phase modulation;Radio frequency","","123","","36","IEEE","24 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome the beam-squinting problem, low-dispersion, fast-wave transmission lines can be employed. Such transmission lines can be designed by loading a regular transmission line with non-Foster reactive elements (e.g., negative capacitors and inductors). As a result of a recent development, these non-Foster reactive elements can be implemented using loss-compensated negative-group-delay (NGD) networks, providing a solution to the stability issues associated with conventional non-Foster networks. In this work, transmission lines augmented by loss-compensated NGD networks, representing the non-Foster reactive-element loading, are employed for designing wideband fast-wave, low-dispersion transmission lines. This work consolidates this non-Foster reactive element loading method with earlier efforts where NGD networks were used to implement zero-degree phase shifters for beamforming at the broadside direction, and generalizes these methods for arbitrary-angle beamforming from backfire to endfire including the broadside direction. Experimental results are presented for a wideband linear four-element transmitting array feed network for beamforming at 30° with respect to the broadside direction in the frequency range 1-1.5 GHz. By connecting this feed network to four wideband tapered-slot antennas, the beamforming performance is experimentally verified inside an anechoic chamber. Moreover, the antenna array is experimentally tested for transmission of a narrow pulse, where low distortion is observed at the beamforming angle over the entire operating bandwidth. The physical length of the feed network is realistic and is 0.96 wavelengths long at the center of this frequency range. In addition, switched-line phase shifters are employed for squint-free beamforming in three other angles: 60°, 0°, and $-30^{\circ}$.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2408364","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada NSERC; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051262","Non-Foster reactances;linear antenna arrays;dispersion engineering;Antenna feeds;dispersion engineering;linear antenna arrays;negative group delay (NGD);negative group velocity (NGV);non-Foster reactances","Power transmission lines;Loading;Array signal processing;Antenna feeds;Linear antenna arrays","","103","","31","IEEE","27 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This analytical result is validated via numerical optimization of the excitation coefficients, and the same procedure is utilized to assess the maximal backscattering of arrays of electric Hertzian dipoles (EHDs). It is found that electrically small arrays of two and three EHDs can enhance the backscattering by factors of 6.22 and 22.01, respectively, with respect to the maximum value generated by a single element.

Experimental investigations of in-room radio environments indicate that the delay power spectrum exhibits an exponentially decaying tail. This tail can be characterized with Sabine's or Eyring's reverberation models, which were initially developed in acoustics. So far, these models were only fitted to data collected from radio measurements, but no thorough validation of their prediction ability in electromagnetics has been performed yet. This paper provides a contribution to fill this gap. We follow Sabine's original experimental approach, which consists in comparing model predictions to experimental observations in a room, while varying its mean absorption coefficient and total room surface. We find that Eyring's model provides a more accurate prediction of the parameters characterizing the decaying tail, such as the reverberation time, than Sabine's model. We further use the reverberation models to predict the parameters of a recently proposed model of a distance-dependent delay power spectrum. This model enables us to predict the path loss, mean delay, and root mean square (rms) delay spread versus transmitter-receiver distance. We observe good agreement between predictions and experimental results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2423636","EU(grant numbers:ICT-248894); Wireless Hybrid Enhanced Mobile Radio Estimators—Phase 2 WHERE2; EU FP7 Network of Excellence in Wireless Communications NEWCOM(grant numbers:318306); VIRTUOSO; Intel Mobile Communications, Anite, Telenor, Aalborg University, and the Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7087370","Indoor environments;radio propagation;reverberation;Indoor environments;radio propagation;reverberation","Reverberation;Delays;Predictive models;Absorption;Electromagnetics;Receivers;Transmitters","","24","","26","IEEE","16 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But, as target rotation rate is not concerned in the CS-based imaging methods, the obtained image cannot be scaled in the cross-range dimension. Consequently, difficulties arise in extracting the target geometrical information from the CS ISAR image. But, target geometrical size is an important parameter in automatic radar target recognition. To remedy this problem, a joint ISAR imaging and cross-range scaling method is proposed. In the proposed method, an adaptive parametric dictionary, comprising chirp rate parameter, is used to represent the observed data. By minimizing the reconstruction error, sparsity-constrained optimization, combined with the chirp-rate parameter and target reflective coefficient, is established. To find a solution to the nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, an iterative procedure is developed. Finally, with the help of the chirp-rate, target rotation rate can be estimated by the least square method, and the ISAR image can be scaled in cross-range. Experimental results show that the proposed method can fit the observed data better than the method using a fixed Fourier dictionary. Besides, cross-range scaled ISAR images can be obtained with limited pulses.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2409876","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271291,61271024,61201292,61201283); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7054479","Compressive sensing;inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR);adaptive dictionary;Adaptive dictionary;compressive sensing (CS);cross-range scaling;inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)","Chirp;Dictionaries;Imaging;Vectors;Radar imaging;Optimization","","23","","35","IEEE","4 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The equivalent sources of the wideband NESA (WNESA) are obtained by an inverse-source process, enforcing equivalence of radiated fields on suitably defined testing surfaces. In the low-frequency region, the NESA is used unmodified, with a complexity of O(N). In the high-frequency region, in order to obtain a fixed rank matrix compression, we hierarchically divide the far coupling space into pyramids with angles related to the peer coupling group size, and the NESA testing surfaces are defined as the boundaries of the pyramids. This results in a directional nested low-rank (fixed rank) approximation with O(N log N) computational complexity that is kernel independent; overall, the approach yields wideband fast solver for the modeling of large structures that inherits the efficiency and accuracy of low-frequency NESA for multiscale problems.

On invoking the contour deformation method, the highly oscillatory Fock currents are efficiently calculated. Furthermore, the workload for the calculation of Fock currents is frequency-independent. To capture the high-frequency wave physics phenomenon, the Fock current is separated into the classical physical optics (PO) current and the nonuniform (NU)-Fock current along the shadow boundary and in the deep shadow region. To calculate the highly oscillatory scattered wave fields from the Fock current, quadratic approximations of the phase functions in the integrand are adopted. On invoking the numerical steepest descent path (NSDP) method, the scattered wave fields are efficiently calculated with frequency-independent computational effort and error controllable accuracy in each frequency-independent segment.

The profiling radiometer measures the sky brightness temperatures at five Ka-band and seven V-band channels, surface temperature, surface humidity, and surface pressure. From July 2009 to March 2011, the beacon receiver recorded the 19.7-GHz (horizontal polarization) HotBird 6 beacon signal along a slant path of 38.6° of elevation angle. Since April 2011, the beacon receiver has been recording the 20.2-GHz (vertical polarization) Astra 3B beacon signal along a slant path of 35.1° of elevation angle. This paper aims at providing a complete description of the ONERA Data Processing Tool (in particular the methodology followed to retrieve total attenuation) used to compute 4 years (from July 2009 to June 2013) of copolar attenuation statistics. The experimental setup and the characteristics of the Earth-space links are briefly described. The complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of total attenuation for the whole period is presented and compared with ITU-R recommendations.

The algorithm solves space-time samples of the complex envelope of the surface current density by implicit time marching; thus, the time-step size is inversely proportional to the bandwidth- not the maximum frequency content-of the fields of interest. At each time step, anterpolation, propagation, interpolation, and near-zone correction stages are performed to compute the right-hand side of a matrix equation, which involves 4-D space-time FFTs, and to accelerate its iterative solution, which involves 3-D space FFTs. These FFTs dominate the computational costs of the method: they require O(NC[log2 Ng + N̅I log NC]) operations per time step; here, NC is the number of nodes on an auxiliary regular grid, Ng is determined by the number of time steps that fields take to travel the maximum distance between two points on the scattering surface, and N̅I is the average number of iterations needed for the iterative solution to converge at each time step. Moreover, the algorithm is systematically compared to its time- and frequency-domain counterparts. To this end, radar profiles of benchmark targets are computed, a time-domain dB-error norm is proposed, the algorithms' parameters are optimized subject to at most 2% error in the radar profile according to this norm, and the computational costs are measured, as target size, shape, and excitation pulse are varied. The results show that the algorithm outperforms its time-domain counterpart and is competitive with its frequency-domain counterpart.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2407905","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:OCI-0904907); Moncrief Grand Challenge Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052323","Integral equations;envelope simulation;transient analysis;range profile;Envelope simulation;integral equations;range profile;transient analysis","Time-frequency analysis;Equations;Time-domain analysis;Integral equations;Impedance;Computational efficiency","","5","","38","IEEE","2 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While in double-mobile scenarios, the predominant fading mechanism is a combination of Rayleigh and DR fading, Rician fading and fading events caused by the combination of a constant term with a DR component are also occasionally observed. In single-mobile scenarios, temporal fading is Rician or Rayleigh distributed. Additionally, measurements reveal that fading statistics evolve significantly over time, even for small-scale motions of the nodes. We model the transitions between the fading states by means of a hidden Markov model, parameterized from our measurements. Eventually, we propose a complete simulation model that generates channel realizations by combining measurement-based first-order statistics with geometry-based second-order statistics for both types of node mobility.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2403412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7041204","Fading channels;Propagation measurements;Time-varying channels;Fading channels;indoor propagation;multipath channels;propagation measurements;time-varying channels","Peer-to-peer computing;Hidden Markov models;Rayleigh channels;Rician channels;Mobile communication;Time-frequency analysis","","39","","22","IEEE","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is found that the use of tags that have polarization diversity can improve the read performance when they are placed in close proximity to one another compared with conventional linear tags. Two ways of achieving polarization diversity are studied in this paper, namely: 1) using a circularly polarized tag and 2) using a cross-polarized tag pair. Both methods show an improvement in close proximity read performance and it is experimentally demonstrated that by using cross-polarized tag pairs in an array, one achieves on average a 2.6-dB increase in read power margin for a 57-tag array with 1 cm separation compared with using conventional linearly polarized tags.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2403875","U.K. Engineering and Physical Science Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042269","polarization diversity;close proximity;passive ultra high frequency (UHF);radio frequency identification (RFID);circularly polarized tag;tag pairs;Circularly polarized tag;close proximity;passive ultra high frequency (UHF);polarization diversity;radio frequency identification (RFID);tag pairs","Arrays;Polarization;Integrated circuits;Mathematical model;Radiofrequency identification;Interference;Impedance","","12","","22","CCBY","13 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through the optimization model, Pareto front for trading off the peak gain loss (PGL) and the first sidelobe level increase (SLLI) is obtained. Simulations clearly show that for the same root mean square (rms) error for the whole reflector, different distributions along the radius result in different PGLs and first SLLIs. Then, the weighting function of the rms errors is considered and the evaluation formula of PGL is successfully applied to nonuniform errors. It is concluded that besides the radius, the amplitude aperture distribution, and the ratio of focal length to diameter (F/D), errors’ nonuniformity is also an important factor that should be considered in the procedure of the quality evaluation of the reflector surface.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2405077","Foundation for Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2014KL012); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51205301,51490660,51490661); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7046272","Reflector antennas;non-uniform errors;average power patterns;quality evaluation;Average power patterns;nonuniform errors;quality evaluation;reflector antennas","Optimization;Reflector antennas;Apertures;Equations;Mathematical model","","21","","21","IEEE","20 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For imaging purposes, a Rotman lens intrinsically requires that the scattered waves arriving at the array be plane waves. However, this requirement cannot be met in near-field imaging applications, as the scattered waves from targets in the near field defocus at the beam ports of the lens because of the nonplane wave scattering. As a result, out-of-focus blurs appear in the near-field images, thus leading to degradation of picture quality. To address this problem, we propose a localized angle-time spread function (ATSF)-based filtering method to reduce out-of-focus blurs. With the proposed method, the deblurring process becomes simple for a Rotman lens. Both simulations and experiments were performed. The results show that the proposed method significantly improves the quality of near-field images with enhanced resolutions in both angular and radial directions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2408362","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371106,61331007,61201089); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI-1126008); Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-11-1-0160); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051269","Image restoration;near-field imaging;Rotman lens;Image restoration;near-field imaging;out-of-focus blur;Rotman lens","Lenses;Imaging;Arrays;Image resolution;Filtering;Ports (Computers);Numerical models","","10","","18","IEEE","27 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
