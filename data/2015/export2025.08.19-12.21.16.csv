"On Small Terminal MIMO Antennas, Harmonizing Characteristic Modes With Ground Plane Geometry","I. Szini; A. Tatomirescu; G. F.

Those FoM requirements are challenging, specially when applied to electrically small mobile devices, i.e., smart-phones, due to the form factor-reduced dimensions and multiplicity of adjacent frequency bands of operation. Uncorrelated antennas are especially important for MIMO antenna systems; other than few exceptional cases, the reduction of magnitude of complex correlation coefficient will increase the system capacity and data throughput. This work proposes an MIMO antenna system for mobile terminals, based on a realistic form factor and packaging implementation, with a very low magnitude of the complex correlation coefficient and an impressive isolation. An isolation better than 20 dB has been achieved using a folded monopole and a commonly adopted planar inverted F antenna (PIFA) on a platform with a very small form factor (100 × 50 × 10 mm). The proposed implementation is based on the synergy of two known techniques that consists in the: 1) reference ground plane geometry manipulation and 2) in the application of the characteristic mode theory to obtain orthogonal radiation modes. Since MIMO antenna systems at frequencies higher than 1.7 GHz are naturally proper isolated and decorreleated, this work demonstrates the proposed antenna topology enabling higher isolation and uncorrelated antenna system at 750 MHz, which is more difficult to achieve in form factors smaller than 1λ, while maintaining high total efficiency and adequate gain imbalance. In this paper, a simulation model and prototype (1/4λ long) measurement results are presented, demonstrating the implementation feasibility of such antenna system in realistic mobile device embodiment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2398111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029044","MIMO;correlation coefficient;low-band;antenna;handset;Antenna;correlation coefficient;handset;low-band;multiple input–multiple output (MIMO)","MIMO;Antenna radiation patterns;Correlation;Antenna measurements;Mobile antennas","","41","","53","IEEE","2 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dual-feed planar inverted F-antenna (PIFA) has two operating frequencies which can be independently tuned from 0.7 to 1.1 GHz and from 1.7 to 2.3 GHz with better than -10 dB impedance match. The isolation between the high-band and the low-band ports is >13 dB; hence, one resonant frequency can be tuned without affecting the other. The single-feed antenna has two resonant frequencies, which can be independently tuned from 1.2 to 1.6 GHz and from 1.6 to 2.3 GHz with better than -10 dB impedance match for most of the tuning range.

Two slightly different designs based on a dual polarized radiating element are presented. For radar applications, the radiating element is used to excite the two degenerate modes of a cavity with square cross-section. The resulting overall antenna size is $0.5{\lambda _m} \times 0.5{\lambda _m} \times 0.2{\lambda _m}$, where ${\lambda _m}$ is the free space wavelength at the minimum operating frequency. The measured results showed isolation better than 30 dB and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) less than 2.5 over 1–1.95 GHz as well as good radiation pattern performance. For base-station applications, the exciting element was placed in front of a metallic ground plane to increase the beamwidth. This results in a smaller antenna size ($0.38{\lambda _m} \times 0.38{\lambda _m} \times 0.25{\lambda _m}$) at the expense of reduced directivity.

A new sampling strategy is proposed to obtain multiple pattern data of different frequencies having the same poles that correspond to the FI element positions. The obtained multiple pattern sequences have the same shape for the FI pattern requirement, but with different lengths. The generalized MPM (GMPM) and its forward-backward version (GFBMPM) are developed to estimate the best common element positions for different frequencies, which can significantly reduce the number of elements required for the specified wideband pattern shape.

In addition to changing between transmit, receive, and calibration modes, these switches can be used to alter the array thinning to either modify the sidelobe level or move a null.

This via-based methodology can be applied to nearly all of the single-layered FSSs presented in the literature, which exhibit much more convenience in practice than the multilayered FSSs. Through the proposed methodology, users can easily vary the resonant frequency of the considered via-inserted FSS (VI-FSS), adding only some additional vias and without having to modify the original element pattern. In addition, the proposed methodology can be applied to minimize the element size or lower its resonant frequency. To illustrate the methodology, the well-known Jerusalem Cross (JC) FSS was first considered. A high-order equivalent circuit was suggested to model the physical mechanism of the VI-FSS with the applied methodology. A set of closed-form equations was also provided to calculate efficiently the circuit inductances and capacitances, especially those caused by the added vias. The VI-FSS prototype was fabricated and examined in a fully anechoic chamber. Favorable agreement among the proposed circuit, full-wave simulation, and measurement was achieved. For demonstrating the capability of the via-based methodology further, it was applied to two advanced applications: 1) two miniaturized-element FSSs and 2) an FSS absorber.

The interest of such a circumstance is that properly designed virtual experiments can enforce particular and convenient conditions. In this paper, we present an application of this paradigm to the popular contrast source inversion (CSI) method. In particular, we first design a set of virtual experiments capable to induce contrast sources exhibiting circular symmetries (with respect to some pivot points). Then, we devise an original and effective regularized CSI scheme, in which a penalty term is added to the usual cost functional, in order to account for the symmetry of the auxiliary unknowns. Notably, the approach does not require any apriori assumption on the unknown contrast, as it relies on the particular nature of the virtual contrast sources.

From these materials, a skin layer, fatty layer, glandular structures, and phantom tumors were cast from three-dimensional (3-D) printed molds and assembled into a complete BP. These phantoms mimic the anatomical structures of the breast, are reconfigurable for a variety of tests, and are easy to create in a typical lab environment. A microwave breast imaging prototype system was used to measure reflections from BPs. Comparison with reflections from human trials demonstrated that the phantom provides appropriate skin reflections. Phantoms incorporating glandular structures were imaged using a delay-and-sum technique. A response consistent with the position of the inclusions was observed. Overall, the carbon-based phantoms provide similar reflections to human tissue, and have proven useful for testing our imaging algorithms.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2393854","Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions; Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures; Biovantage; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014232","Dielectric materials;Dielectric measurement;Biomedical engineering;Biomedical imaging;Biomedical engineering;biomedical imaging;dielectric materials;dielectric measurement","Skin;Breast;Carbon;Materials;Phantoms;Rubber;Antenna measurements","","73","","36","IEEE","19 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In TWRI applications, existing distributed greedy algorithms such as the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) algorithm and the simultaneous subspace pursuit (SSP) algorithm suffer from high artifacts and low-resolution, respectively. The proposed HMP algorithm aims to combine the strengths of SOMP and SSP (i.e., the orthogonality among selected basis-signals and the backtracking strategy for basis-signal reevaluation) and, accordingly, to reconstruct high-resolution radar images with no visible artifacts.

Then, we introduce new types of patterned surfaces aimed at improving their polarization response. We demonstrate that, only by using four metasurface topologies, it is possible to obtain all required combinations of positive and negative reactance values in order to design effective mantle cloaks for planar, cylindrical, and three-dimensional (3-D) objects. We also show that the accuracy of the analytical formulas commonly used to design such metasurfaces is not necessarily sufficient for cloaking purposes.

It encodes data using the space angle between two arms of the V-shape and is identified by measuring the scattered field in two orthogonal polarization directions. Even if it is tilted, the tag can be identified. The advantage of angle-based tag is that every element can encode three-bit data. This is helpful to get higher capacity. Also, for different codes of one element, the proposed tag uses the same spectrum. This is beneficial to improve the efficiency of the spectrum. First, the tag using the uniform impedance resonator (UIR) is designed. Then, the UIR chipless tag is reformed as stepped impedance resonator (SIR) tag to suppress the second harmonic.

We develop an algorithm capable of optimizing the beam pattern of the holographic antenna through software, reconfigurable controls. Our method provides an effective technique for antenna pattern optimization for a holographic antenna, which significantly suppresses sidelobes. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated both on a computational model of the antenna and experimentally. Due to their exceptional portability, low-power consumption, and lack of moving parts, holographic antennas are an attractive and viable technology when combined with proven software-based strategies to optimize performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2399937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7031374","Satellite antennas;sidelobe canceling;holography;Holography;satellite antennas;sidelobe canceling","Metamaterials;Antenna arrays;Optimization;Antenna radiation patterns;Surface waves","","139","","26","IEEE","4 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
