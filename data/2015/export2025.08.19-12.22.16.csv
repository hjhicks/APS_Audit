The method is based on employing the reactive loading effect of fluid metal bridges on top of the CPW slot antenna. As a result of this reactive loading, the frequency of the antenna reduces and the antenna is miniaturized by a factor of 85%. Also, by changing the configuration of filled and empty channels, each channel can be used as a switch. By using two pairs of microfluidic channels, three different frequency bands of 2.4, 3.5, and 5.8 GHz can be achieved. This translates to a switching ratio (fTR = f2/f1) of more than 2.5. The antenna is realized using common PCB techniques for the antenna circuit board and three-dimensional (3-D) printing technology for PDMS-based microfluidics structure. The antenna circuit board and the PDMS structure are bonded to each other using a very thin spin-coated PDMS layer. Design methodology, simulation, and measurement results of both antenna prototypes are presented. Both the miniature and reconfigurable antennas have similar radiation patterns to a normal CPW folded slot antenna and show low cross-polarization levels at all operating frequencies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2447002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7128694","CPW folded slot antenna;requency reconfigurable antenna;Galinstan;CPW folded slot antenna;frequency reconfigurable antenna;Galinstan;microfluidic tuning;miniaturization","Slot antennas;Coplanar waveguides;Bridge circuits;Resonant frequency;Loaded antennas;Loading","","50","","27","IEEE","19 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The device is based on a patch radiator seamlessly integrated with a bandpass filter composed of coupled stripline open-loop resonators, which are designed together as a system. In the proposed design, the patch functions simultaneously as the radiator and the last stage resonator of the filter, resulting in a low-profile integrated radiating and filtering module with a small overall form factor of 0.53λ0 × 0.53λ0 × 0.07λ0. It is shown that the filtering circuit not only ensures frequency selectivity but also provides impedance matching functionality, which serves to broaden both the impedance and axial ratio bandwidths. The designed filtering antenna was fabricated and measured, experimentally achieving an S11 <; -13.5 dB, an axial ratio of less than 3 dB and a gain higher than 5.2 dBi over a bandwidth from 3.77 to 4.26 GHz, i.e., around 12.2%, which makes it an excellent candidate for integration into a variety of wireless systems. A linearly polarized version of the integrated filtering antenna was also demonstrated. In addition, further full-wave simulations and experiments were carried out to verify that the designed CP filtering antenna maintains its properties even when mounted on different positions of the human body with various body gestures. The stable impedance and radiation properties also make it a suitable candidate as a wearable antenna for off-body wireless communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2452942","National Science Foundation ASSIST Nanosystems ERC(grant numbers:EEC-1160483); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150356","Bandpass filter (BPF);circularly-polarized coupled resonator;filtering antenna;wearable antenna;Bandpass filter (BPF);circularly-polarized coupled resonator;filtering antenna;wearable antenna","Antennas;Band-pass filters;Stripline;Impedance;Bandwidth;Resonator filters","","242","","51","IEEE","6 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the probe radiates significantly due to the discontinuity from the transitions of the probe tip to the microstrip line.

This solution is proposed for next-generation passive RFID tags, performing communication and localization through UWB technology and efficient energy harvesting in the UHF band, but it is also designed to keep compatibility with previous tags generations. The UWB communication is deployed by means of an Archimedean spiral topology, while energy harvesting at UHF is obtained by suitably extending the spiral outer arms, thus realizing a meandered dipole, without affecting the UWB behavior. The single-port architecture provides an overall size reduction, while preserving the radiation performance in both the operating bands. This solution allows a direct connection to future integrated UWB-UHF chips, to standard RFID chips, or to a diplexer for suitably combining the UWB and the UHF functionalities. A prototype of this new antenna, realized on a standard FR-4 substrate, is first presented to validate the proposed novel design. As a second step, the same architecture is scaled on a paper substrate in view of its fully eco-compatible realization to be exploited by future pervasive RFID applications.

The proposed antenna comprises a wideband dual-feed network and two stacked concentric patches assembled by two orthogonally placed vertical probes. The dual-feed network feeds quadrature signals across the RFID bands between 0.92 and 2.45 GHz. The two stacked concentric patches provide resonance frequencies in fundamental mode for lower band and higher band, respectively. Additionally, the antenna features only one connection port and same sense CP radiation at two bands, beneficial to cost and complexity reductions of the dual-band front end of RFID readers. The measurement results show the performances of return loss (RL) >10 dB, 3-dB gain variation, and axial ratio (AR) <;3 dB are achieved on the bands 0.911-0.933 GHz and 2.40- 2.57 GHz. The measured peak gains are 3.8 dBic at 0.926 GHz and 8.9 dBic at 2.48 GHz. In addition, the antenna provides symmetrical patterns with wide-angle half-power beamwidths and wide-angle 3-dB AR beamwidths.

The implementation of the algorithm is based on the use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in both the forward and backward projectors of the IA, allowing for a highly efficient and fast synthesis process of dual-polarized reflectarrays. Although arbitrary restrictions can be enforced in the reflection coefficients, they might not be feasible for passive antennas. Hence, the unit cell is analyzed as a lossless and lossy passive two-port network and the restriction equations are derived for both cases involving amplitudes and phases of the reflection coefficients. The lossless constraints proved to be too restrictive so lossy restrictions should be applied to achieve feasible reflection coefficients for passive array design.

Wide-angle impedance matching (WAIM) alleviates this problem from a transmission-line impedance matching viewpoint, increasing the useable scan range of the array. Traditionally, a dielectric slab is placed at some distance above the array, resulting in a match at some given angle off broadside. We propose a simpler and more effective solution, replacing the dielectric slab with an ultra-thin metasurface composed of a sheet of split-ring resonators (SRRs) to improve the scanning characteristics of a dipole phased array. It is shown that the presence of the metasurface results in significant improvements in multiple scan planes. A generalized equivalent transmission-line model is introduced for the classical WAIM configuration and adapted for the metasurface. A quasianalytical model based on the equivalent transmission-line model and the extracted scattering parameters of the metasurface properly predicts the scan range of the full structure, and allows for an accelerated design process.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2448231","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7130580","Antenna theory;phased arrays;periodic structures;Antenna theory;dipole arrays;impedance matching;metamaterials;metasurfaces;periodic structures;phased arrays","Impedance;Dielectrics;Slabs;Manganese;Transmission lines;Phased arrays;Adaptation models","","125","","25","IEEE","22 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consideration was given to their physical attributes, i.e., the unit cell dimensions and spacing, substrate thickness and dielectric properties, for several frequencies and plane wave incident angles. Correlation analysis and evaluation of the influence of physical related input parameters on the FSS performance are presented. Subsequent optimization factor for the square loop classical EC model is analyzed, and a novel EC model formulation for the square slot FSS is proposed. The performance of the proposed EC model was assessed against results obtained from appropriate electromagnetic (EM) simulations, based on a root-mean-square error (RMSE) criteria. Results demonstrate the validity of the optimized EC model, in which good estimations of the frequency response of FSS structures were obtained. Significant reduction of the resonant frequency offsets, in the order of 650 (from 910 to 260) and 460 (770 to 310) MHz, was obtained for square loops and square slots, respectively. The models were further validated against measurements performed on two physical FSS prototypes inside an anechoic chamber at 2.4 GHz. Relatively good agreement was obtained between measurements of real FSS prototypes and results obtained with the EC model.

The singularity expansion method (SEM) allows modeling the antenna backscattering using poles which are theoretically independent of the wave incident angle, making them useful for antenna identification. Nevertheless, only the physical poles respect this property while the spurious poles change for each incident angle. Indeed, we call the poles linked to the antenna itself as “physical” and the poles linked to anything but the antenna as “spurious”(excitation, noise, etc.). The goal of this paper is to highlight the method to define the optimal time windowing applied on the antenna backscattering in order to obtain the physical poles of the antenna. The approach is based on the window decreasing technique (WDT) and the window increasing technique. The SEM is applied on the backscattered field measured in the boresight direction of three antennas: 1) a narrowband patch antenna; 2) a wideband helix antenna; and 3) a UWB antenna. Using these poles to reconstruct the field backscattered in several directions, we show that the poles extracted from one direction with this new approach are relevant to reconstruct the backscattered field for any other directions.

In order to obtain unified expressions that are valid for scattering in all directions, the average bistatic RCS of a spherical chaff cloud is derived as the sum of incoherent and coherent contributions. Simplified forms for these expressions are provided for five representative directions/polarizations. In the forward scatter direction, the coherent contribution is dominant, but in the angular region about that direction, the bistatic RCS pattern is beam-like and is dependent on both the coherent and incoherent contributions. An expression is provided for the width of this “beam.” The derived expressions are verified by statistical numerical RCS computations based on the method of moments. Since these numerical calculations include interparticle coupling, whereas the derived expressions assume that such coupling is not present, the numerical results also provide criteria for the interparticle distance that is required for this coupling to be ignored in bistatic RCS calculations. This distance is seen to depend on the direction of scatter.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2452963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150337","Chaff;coherent;incoherent;RCS;scattering;Chaff;coherent;incoherent;radar cross section (RCS);scattering","Scattering;Optical fiber polarization;Couplings;Clouds;Wires;Optical fiber communication;Radar cross-sections","","17","","24","IEEE","6 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed approach, the mode-to-mode mapping matrix M, which is the expression of the propagation channel in the spherical vector wave domain, is estimated by applying pseudo-inverse computation to the channel transfer functions with dedicated spherical arrays. The estimated M is truncated and only the dominant modes within the spatial bandwidth of the fields radiated from the finite volume of the spherical array are considered. Two types of spherical array are investigated: 1) an ideal array using tangential dipoles; and 2) a virtual array using dielectric resonator antenna (DRA). The ideal array is used for parameter investigation including the array radius and the spacing with regard to the size of M and the condition number of the excitation coefficient matrix, while the virtual DRA array is proposed as a practical implementation of the ideal array. The accuracy of the proposed approach has been validated numerically. The uncertainties of spherical array in practice, such as the influence of nonideally embedded array elements, cables, and fixtures, are considered in the validation. Moreover, the channel transfer functions reproduced by the de-embedded M are analyzed, given different target antennas at link ends. The gain and phase discrepancies as well as the antenna correlations of the reproduced channel transfer function are compared with the generated reference.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2443854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7122263","mode-to-mode mapping matrix;antenna deembedding;truncated modes;ideal spherical array;virtual spherical DRA array;Antenna de-embedding;ideal spherical array;mode-to-mode mapping matrix;truncated modes;virtual spherical DRA array","Antenna arrays;Receiving antennas;Antenna measurements;Channel estimation;Transfer functions","","16","1","25","IEEE","11 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A compact dual-band WLAN antenna is then designed, manufactured, and measured as an example application of utilizing the bandwidth estimators. Another example demonstrates how the bandwidth estimators can be used to determine a matching and decoupling circuit for a symmetrical dual-element antenna.

We therefore propose an alternative and approximate method to determine mutual coupling between antennas on vehicles for the case where there is line-of-sight (LOS) between the antennas. The proposed method is based on approximating the mutual coupling between LOS antennas on vehicles as near-field transmission between antennas in free space. We begin the analysis with a brief review of four methods for calculating the near-field free-space transmission. Of the investigated methods, we demonstrate that a nonsingular form of the near-field transmission integral originally proposed by Yaghjian (1982) is the most suitable for LOS antennas on vehicles. We introduce a modification to this method, in order to only use the antenna far-fields and geometrical separation to determine the mutual coupling. The comparison with full-wave simulations indicates that the proposed method has a good accuracy for LOS antennas. This paper ends with a full-scale mutual coupling calculation for two monopoles on an aircraft under LOS conditions, demonstrating a root mean square (rms) accuracy of 6 dB for frequencies up to 5 GHz, as compared with full-wave simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2447003","Saab Electronic Defence Systems in Stockholm; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7128354","Near-fields;Electromagnetic interference;Aircraft antennas;Aircraft reliability;Electrically large structures;Aircraft antennas;aircraft reliability;electrically large structures;electromagnetic interference;near-fields","Mutual coupling;Vehicles;Transmitting antennas;Mathematical model;Receiving antennas;Method of moments","","25","","24","IEEE","18 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, among other things, specific absorption rate (SAR) can become a challenge due to the relative high current density associated with high-Q antennas. The higher energy stored in the electric and magnetic near-field components can result in higher SAR. Hence, SAR study of high-Q antennas is necessary which, if not addressed, might not comply with the SAR safety guidelines. In this paper, SAR as a function of antenna Q is investigated numerically as well as experimentally at two distinct frequencies (720 and 1700 MHz). It is found that SAR increases as a function of antenna Q when no losses are considered. But when losses are included, there is no more a clear trend between SAR and antenna Q. Thus, the final SAR values depend on total losses of the mock-up (MU).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2452959","Smart Antenna Front End (SAFE); Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation—Innovation Fund Denmark; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150350","SAR;near-field;high-Q antenna;ILA;loop;antenna losses;mobile communication;Antenna losses;high-Q antenna;inverted L antenna (ILA);loop;mobile communication;near-field;specific absorption rate (SAR)","Antenna accessories;Impedance;Mobile antennas;Mathematical model;Bandwidth","","1","","26","IEEE","6 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulation and experimental results of reflect-arrays consisting of simple square-ring elements show that a 16.7% measured bandwidth within 1.5-dB gain variation can be achieved by a single-layer design with a thin substrate.

For conducting objects or homogeneous penetrable objects, the time-domain surface integral equations (TDSIEs) can be applied. Traditionally, the TDSIEs are solved by combining the method of moments (MoM) in spatial domain and a march-on-in-time (MoT) scheme in temporal domain. The MoM usually requires conforming meshes with a well-designed basis function and the MoT may suffer from a stability problem. In this work, we propose a hybrid scheme in which the Nyström method is used in spatial domain while the MoM with Laguerre function as basis and testing functions is employed with a march-on-in-degree (MoD) manner in the temporal domain. The Nyström method does not require any basis and testing functions and can use nonconforming meshes in spatial domain, whereas the MoM with Laguerre function as basis and testing functions can fully eliminate the stability problem in temporal domain. Numerical examples for EM scattering by typical conducting objects are presented to demonstrate the scheme and its merits have been verified.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2448792","Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(grant numbers:20120072110044); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131483","Transient electromagnetic scattering;time-domain integral equation;Nystrom method;method of moments;Method of moments (MoM);Nyström method;time-domain integral equation (TDIE);transient electromagnetic (EM) scattering","Time-domain analysis;Method of moments;Integral equations;Transient analysis;Antennas;Scattering","","11","","34","IEEE","23 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
