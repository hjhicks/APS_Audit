This antenna, composed of a pair of planar monopoles, a pair of bowtie shaped slots and a microstrip antenna, provides a broadband operation while its height is only 0.035 λ0, where λ0 is the wavelength referring to the center frequency of the operating band. More importantly, the proposed antenna radiates unidirectionally without the need of a metallic reflector. And therefore the total antenna volume is reduced to 0.011 λ03. A prototype was fabricated and measured. It exhibits an impedance bandwidth (SWR ≤ 2) of 20.7% from 1.387 GHz to 1.696 GHz, a stable boresight gain of 6.11 dBi and a unidirectional radiation pattern with low back radiation ( dB), low cross-polarization ( dB).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2365574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939637","complementary antennas;low profile antennas;microstrip antennas;wideband antennas","Microstrip antennas;Dipole antennas;Microstrip;Antenna radiation patterns;Slot antennas;Antenna measurements;Bandwidth","","13","","25","IEEE","29 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This means that the feasibility of a particular diode for harmonic transponder applications largely depends on its varactor properties.

Furthermore, it can reserve multiple antenna settings corresponding to existing communication links in the initial training by making use of the quasi-optical nature of millimeter-waves. This enables fast beam switching when link blockage occurs. The training is executed in short durations by putting together DoA/DoD-estimation and “beam-combining” techniques. The basic function of MIDC is verified experimentally in a simple multipath propagation environment by using our 60-GHz CMOS transceiver LSIs integrated with planar phased-array antennas.

It is well known that a modern day digital phase shifter which is associated with each transmit/receive module typically relies on three to seven bits. Each of these phase shifters provide a desired resolution of 45° to 2.8125°, respectively. When an array is steered with a fixed precision set of phase shifters, there are some angles where results are significantly better than others. For example, six bit phase shifters can provide exact 11.25° differential phases in a linear array, but not 15°, and subsequent quantization errors lead to reduced pointing accuracy and increased sidelobe levels. However, these errors can be minimized if the set of shifters operate collectively instead of independently with “blind” quantization. In particular this study seeks the solution for the following problem: for a set of N phase shifters, each defined by B bits, determine the optimal way to distribute the N×B bits so that the array performance is maximized.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2366198","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-0925873); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942173","Array factor;phase quantization error;phase shifters;phased array radar;simulated annealing","Arrays;Phase shifters;Quantization (signal);Beam steering;Approximation algorithms;Radar;Radar antennas","","11","","23","IEEE","31 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Studies are conducted from three aspects: Firstly, the dispersion relations of non-dispersive (conventional) and dispersive (composite right/left-handed (CRLH)) materials are analyzed. Regarding each category of materials, detailed analyses for distributed layered media and lumped circuits are presented. Through studies, we found that the periodicity increase opens up multiple stopbands. According to our physical explanations and numerical results, the relation between stopbands and periodicity is clarified. Additionally, the periodicity increase also reduces the separation distance of space harmonic modes along the phase constant axis in the dispersion diagram. Thus, more space harmonic modes are excited in the radiation. This phenomenon results in simultaneous right- and left-handed radiation and multiple radiation beams. Secondly, mathematical formulas for the general dispersion relation and the general Bragg condition of the MP structures are derived. The formulas help to indicate the locations of stopbands and engineer the dispersion relation. Thirdly, applications of the MP structures to phase reversal (PR) antennas are presented. Both transmission and radiation characteristics of the MP structures are validated by the PR antennas experimentally.

This paper reveals the reason, provides some useful conclusions and proposes an optimum design. Firstly, a first-order analytical formula is derived for the array factor (AF) of the 4-element sub-SRA. The formula embraces the polarization properties of the antenna elements. The AF is found to be dependent on the elements' polarization properties and frequency, which is not found in conventional regular arrays. Based on the theoretical results and full-wave simulations, these dependencies are analyzed in detail. Secondly, an optimum design is proposed to enhance the gain bandwidth: to constitute SRA with elliptically polarized elements (this type of SRA is denoted as EP-SRA) rather than the conventional circularly polarized elements (this type of SRA is denoted as CP-SRA). Detailed design guidance is presented for this new method. Finally, as an example, a CP-SRA and an EP-SRA are designed and tested for comparison. According to the example, by employing EP-SRA, the 1 dB AF bandwidth is improved by 80%, the measured 1 dB/3 dB gain bandwidth is enhanced by 114%/76%.

To steer the beam of the antenna the diodes are set off and on, so that the radiation pattern of the antenna is determined by the number of off state columns. To estimate the general dimension of the cylindrical FSS, an equivalent metallic reflector is introduced and optimized, and then parametric studies for the unit cell dimensions are discussed.

Previously, practical implementation of BEM solvers often required the aggregation of multiple disparate integral-evaluation schemes in order to treat all of the distinct types of integrals needed for a given BEM formulation; in contrast, our technique allows many different types of integrals to be handled by the same algorithm and the same code implementation. Our method is a significant generalization of the Taylor-Duffy approach, which was originally presented for just a single type of integrand; in addition to generalizing this technique to a broad class of integrands, we also achieve a significant improvement in its efficiency by showing how the dimension of the final numerical integral may often reduced by one. In particular, if n is the number of common vertices between the two triangles, in many cases we can reduce the dimension of the integral from 4-n to 3-n, obtaining a closed-form analytical result for n=3 (the common-triangle case).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2367492","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:N66001-09-1-2070-DOD); Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-07-D-0004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6948234","Boundary-element method (BEM);code generation;computer algebra;electric-field integral equation (EFIE);Galerkin formulation;impedance matrix;method of moments (MOM);PMCHW;magnetic-field integral equation (MFIE);singular integrals;singularity cancellation;singularity subtraction","Kernel;Polynomials;Integral equations;Time division multiplexing;Closed-form solutions;Open source software","","29","","32","IEEE","5 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By manipulating the dimension parameters, we design the dual-band, 3-dB and 10-dB band absorbers. We achieved the absorber's thickness of 0.039λg with the single layer due to high loss of inter-digital capacitor patterns on the FSS. Additionally, the proposed absorbers are insensitive to polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves because of the symmetric structure of the FSS. In this study, the absorber mechanism and transmission line (TL) modeling for the absorber design are studied. Each of the proposed absorbers is analyzed by using the TL equivalent circuit model and full-wave analysis. The loss factor is studied in order to demonstrate the origin of losses, and a parametric study is conducted to explain how to vary the absorbing bandwidths.

Classically, the stored energy is either determined from the input impedance of the antenna or the electromagnetic fields around the antenna. The new energy expressions proposed by Vandenbosch express the stored energy in the current densities in the antenna structure. These expressions are equal to the stored energy defined from the difference between the energy density and the far field energy for many but not all cases. Here, the different approaches to determine the stored energy are compared for dipole, loop, inverted L-antennas, and bow-tie antennas. We use Brune synthesized circuit models to determine the stored energy from the input impedance. We also compare the results with differentiation of the input impedance and the obtained bandwidth. The results indicate that the stored energy in the fields, currents, and circuit models agree well for small antennas. For higher frequencies, the stored energy expressed in the currents agrees with the stored energy determined from Brune synthesized circuit models whereas the stored energy approximated by differentiation of input impedance gives a lower value for some cases. The corresponding results for the bandwidth suggest that the inverse proportionality between the fractional bandwidth and Q-factor depends on the threshold level of the reflection coefficient.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2368111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949068","Antenna Q;antenna theory;Brune synthesis;Stored energy","Energy storage;Impedance;Bandwidth;Q-factor;RLC circuits;Antennas;Zinc","","55","","41","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A simple analytical model, that depends only on the geometry, is derived to predict the dispersion curves for a quite general class of geometries. The proposed model is also extended to cases in which the MTSs are printed on a grounded or ungrounded dielectric slab, by using an equivalent dielectric constant. Comparisons with dispersion curves obtained through full-wave simulations confirm the accuracy of the model all over the Brillouin region. Finally, it is shown that connecting or disconnecting the metal patches along a given path allows for a confinement of the SWs on such a path.

This approach employs a version of Boris's algorithm applied to particle-in-cell plasma computational models. There are four primary advantages of this new method over previously developed three-dimensional FDTD models of electromagnetic wave propagation in magnetized plasma. Specifically, it: 1) requires less memory; 2) is more than 50% faster; 3) is easier to implement; and 4) permits the use of two different time step increments when solving the current equation versus Maxwell's equations that is useful for modeling high collisional regimes. The new algorithm is faster because it solves all the equations explicitly and there is no need to solve complicated matrix equations. Modeling of higher altitude ranges and higher frequency electromagnetic waves is much more feasible using this new method. Results of the new FDTD magnetized plasma model are provided and validated.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2366203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942177","Earth;electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation;finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method;ionosphere;magnetized cold plasma","Mathematical model;Equations;Vectors;Current density;Time-domain analysis;Finite difference methods;Plasmas","","56","","37","IEEE","31 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After investigating various parameters of the technique such as time-window length and filtering parameter, some scenarios are studied. First, the proposed technique is applied to the backscattered response from two dipoles spaced 20 cm from each other. The dominantly excited resonances and scattering centers are successfully derived from the time-frequency diagram. Finally, the proposed technique is applied to the time-domain backscattered response from an open-ended circular cavity. Different scattering mechanisms such as resonant, scattering center, and dispersion are studied in the time-frequency diagram of the response. The results are compared with those of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and reassigned joint time-frequency (RJTF) techniques. Good resolution in time and frequency domains and its capability of finding low-energy excited poles of the scatterer are the major features of the proposed technique. By utilizing the proposed technique, the damping factor or equivalently the quality factor of the resonances are straightforwardly obtained, which can be useful in the study of resonant-based scatterers.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2365823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940215","Scattering short-time matrix pencil method (STMPM);singularity expansion method (SEM);time-frequency technique","Time-frequency analysis;Resonant frequency;Scattering;Cavity resonators;Signal resolution;Time-domain analysis","","12","","35","IEEE","30 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model is able to take the on-body radiation pattern of the antenna, as well as arbitrary head contours into account. The model is validated by the use of measurements and Ansys HFSS simulations on the specific anthropomorphic mannequin (SAM) head. The model is used with a genetic algorithm in order to synthesize a radiation pattern that is optimal for use with the ear-to-ear on-body channel. The radiation pattern is synthesized in terms of the spherical wave expansion coefficients of the hypothetical small antenna. The variation in the ear-to-ear on-body path gain, due to perturbations of the shape of the nominal SAM head, is studied by the use of a Monte Carlo analysis.

The antenna is miniaturized to λo/8 size but with excellent port isolation of more than -30 dB. It has two polarizations, with a simulated bandwidth of about 6.9%. The T-probes are used to feed the 4-C slot-cut patches to widen the bandwidth. A lumped circuit feeding for the 4-C slot-cut patch antenna is also introduced.

Good three-port isolations are achieved by the multi-mode excitations including even, odd and bi-directional modes.

A novel multi-layer periodic array design is proposed for sub-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavity type antennas with enhanced bandwidth performance. Three double-sided periodic arrays are designed and optimized, each double-sided array consisting of a capacitive artificial impedance surface (AIS) and an inductive partially reflective surface (PRS) printed on either side of a dielectric substrate. They are placed at about sixth of a wavelength from a ground plane and from each other. Thus, three air cavities are created with a total profile of λ/2. The proposed antenna has been simulated using CST Microwave Studio and measured achieving 16.9 dBi directivity with 10.7% 3 dB bandwidth. The gain-bandwidth product of the proposed designs outperforms any previous Fabry-Perot antenna design with this profile.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2365825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940214","Artificial impedance surface;Fabry-Perot cavity;leaky-wave antennas;partially reflective surfaces","Antenna measurements;Cavity resonators;Bandwidth;Broadband antennas;Arrays;Reflection","","121","","21","IEEE","30 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The liners introduce an HE11 mode well below the natural cutoff frequency, which provides substantial gain improvements over a similarly sized waveguide probe. A new feeding arrangement employing a shielded-loop source embedded inside the miniaturized waveguide is developed to efficiently excite the HE11 mode and avoid the excitation of other modes across the frequency-reduced band while maintaining the antenna's compactness. A metamaterial-lined circular-waveguide probe antenna operating over 42% below its natural cutoff frequency is designed to provide a radiation efficiency of up to 28.8%. A simple, printed-circuit implementation of the metamaterial liner based on inductively loaded wires is proposed and its dispersion features are discussed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2367551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6948221","Circular waveguides;epsilon-near-zero;inhomogeneous waveguides;metamaterials;miniaturization;negative permittivity;open-ended waveguide probes","Metamaterials;Cutoff frequency;Probes;Dispersion;Electromagnetic waveguides;Permittivity;Antennas","","26","","22","IEEE","5 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Threefold objectives of this investigation includes: (i) to realize HEM12δ mode in a practical CDRA without involving any unwanted hybrid mode; (ii) to explore composite aperture type feed, which serves as equivalent magnetic and electric dipoles to launch HEM11δ mode and HEM12δ mode, respectively; and hence (iii) to achieve a dual-mode dualband CDRA without compromising in any enlargement of antenna dimension. HEM12δ mode is a recent introduction by the present authors as a broadside radiating mode in a CDRA, although this investigation demonstrates a practically feasible application for the first time. Systematic study of newly proposed composite aperture is followed by experimental investigation with a set of prototypes operating at S and C bands. As much as 6 dBi gain with 7-8% matching bandwidth for each operating band has been experimentally demonstrated.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2368116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949091","Aperture-fed antenna;dielectric resonator antenna;dualband antenna;dual-mode antenna","Feeds;Gain;Dual band;Dielectric resonator antennas;Aperture antennas;Bandwidth","","88","","19","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An efficient algorithm based on the contour method is proposed in this communication to locate these poles and calculate the residues. The proposed method is robust for both the lossless and lossy media. With the proposed approach, it is shown in numerical examples that some poles, very close to a branch cut, are successfully extracted in lossy media. The accurate calculation of the Green's functions in lossy layered media enables the accurate and efficient modeling of complex structures in lossy semiconductor substrates and new 3D IC structures including through-silicon vias (TSVs).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2367545","Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships(grant numbers:0855878); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6948334","Discrete complex image method (DCIM);lossy layered media;pole extraction;Sommerfeld integral;spectral-domain Green's functions;surface-wave poles","Nonhomogeneous media;Green's function methods;Spectral analysis;Surface waves;Dielectric losses;Algorithm design and analysis","","9","","17","IEEE","5 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
