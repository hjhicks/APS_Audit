In contrast to conventional methods, we use reflection-only measurements, utilizing readily available geometries, such as a PEC-plate and a PEC-dihedral corner reflector, to estimate the co- and cross-polarized gain of the AUT. Predicted error using this approach is less than 0.07 dB for the co-pol and 0.26 dB for the cross-pol for an AUT with 17 dBi gain at 100 GHz. Experimental results for a radial line slot array antenna, operating in F-band, show good agreement between the conventional method, and that proposed using phase-less method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2473685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226799","antenna measurement;circular polarization;millimeter-wave;terahertz;RLSA;frequency-extender;dihedral corner;Antenna measurement;circular polarization;dihedral corner;frequency-extender;millimeter-wave;radial line slot array (RLSA);terahertz","Antenna measurements;Gain;Antenna arrays;Frequency measurement;Phase measurement;Gain measurement","","23","","20","IEEE","27 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna structure resembles a circular loop formed by a circular array of shunt miniaturized n-fold resonant dipole antennas, which will be referred to as miniature composite wireloop antenna (MCWLA). The proposed antenna does not require an external matching network and can easily be matched to balanced ports with any desired impedance. MCWLAs can be made to be a very small fraction of the wavelength and yet to provide a relatively high radiation efficiency. The antenna input impedance can be adjusted by the number of array n-folded dipole elements, the number of folds and the diameter of the composite loop. The input impedance can be lowered by increasing the number of elements and/or by decreasing the loop diameter. Conversely, the input impedance, for a fixed number of elements and diameter, can be increased by increasing the fold number. The antenna efficiency increases with increasing the loop diameter. To demonstrate the proposed concept, a MCWLA is designed with diameter λ/8 and is designed and fabricated using the standard PCB approach on a thin substrate (λ/500). To achieve omnidirectional radiation pattern in H-plane, a minimum of three elements fed in-phase around the inscribing loop are used. It is shown that impedance match to a 50-Ω line can be achieved using fourfold miniaturized dipole elements. The simulation shows strong uniform current distribution on the A transformer balun that is used to connect the balanced port of the antenna to a small coaxial line at the center of the loop. The measured gain, including the loss through the balun, is to be 0 dBi and the gain variation in the H-plane is shown to be less than 0.5 dB for the prototype MCWLA.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2456971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160701","Composite loop antennas;dipole Antennas;folded antennas;miniaturized antennas;omnidirectional antennas;Composite loop antennas;dipole antennas;folded antennas;miniaturized antennas;omnidirectional antennas","Dipole antennas;Antenna measurements;Antenna radiation patterns;Impedance;Impedance matching;Antenna feeds","","34","","15","IEEE","16 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stop band is investigated to best match the (leaky-wave) antenna-mode region of the first higher mode. An approximate formula is derived to estimate the start of the stop band. When the fundamental mode is suppressed in the required band, a microstrip leaky-wave antenna can be efficiently fed with a simple asymmetrical feeding structure and no additional out-phase network is needed.

The helix is formed using printed strips with straight-edge connections implemented by plated viaholes. The currents flowing on the strips and along via-holes of the helix contribute to the horizontal and vertical polarizations, respectively. Besides, the current on the ground plane is utilized to weaken the strong amplitude of the horizontal electric field generated by the one on the strips. Thus, a good circular polarization can be achieved. Furthermore, a tapered helix and conducting side-walls are employed to broaden the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth as well as to improve the end-fire radiation pattern. The designed antenna operates at the center frequency of 10 GHz. Simulated results show that the planar helical antenna achieves wide-impedance bandwidth (|S11| <; -10 dB) from 7.4 to 12.8 GHz (54%) and 3-dB AR bandwidth from 8.2 to 11.6 GHz (34%), while retaining a thickness of only 0.11λ0 at the center frequency.

The slots in the proposed structure are placed on the centerline of the broad wall of the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW), in order to reduce cross polarization. Also, the asymmetric field distributions on both sides of each slot, which are required for making radiation possible, are realized through using ridges close to the narrow walls of the SIW. The admittance of a single slot in the proposed structure is obtained regarding the different values of the main parameters of the structure. An eight-element longitudinal slot array antenna on the broad wall of the RSIW is designed based on Elliot's design procedure. In this design, internal and external mutual coupling effects are taken into account through calculating the active admittance for each slot of the array. A 2-D graph is presented which contains the real and imaginary parts of the equivalent admittance of a slot based on the changes in the widths of the ridges and length of the slot. Using this graph, the widths of the ridges and length of the slot can be revised in a way that the mutual coupling effect is taken into account. Since the array antenna is composed of collinear elements, it demonstrates a better cross polarization and isolation in comparison with conventional slot array antennas. Simulation results show good agreement with measurement results of the fabricated proposed antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2457952","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7161308","slotted SIW array antenna;mutual coupling and ridged substrate integrated waveguide (RSIW);Mutual coupling;ridged substrate integrated waveguide (RSIW);slotted SIW array antenna","Arrays;Slot antennas;Admittance;Antenna arrays;Mutual coupling;Antenna radiation patterns;Periodic structures","","31","2","34","IEEE","17 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reflection coefficient is measured using a human subject as a monopole antenna. Measurement results show that the theoretical predictions are in reasonable agreement. It is found that the human body resonates between 40 and 60 MHz depending on the posture of the body when it is fed by a 50-Ω impedance system at the base of the foot. A minimum reflection coefficient of -12 dB is measured which demonstrates that the human body can be potentially used as an antenna.

An extensive detailed study of the nonresonant unit cell is performed to understand the phase error loss mechanism and to find the best periodicity (unit cell size or interelement spacing) that produces almost the same phase response not only at different frequencies but also for both normal and oblique incidence which leads to lower oblique phase error (OPE) loss across the lens aperture and higher aperture efficiency. Unit cells of 0.47λ94 GHz ≤ periodicity ≤ 0.68λ94 GHz are studied and the optimum periodicity is addressed. Based on this study, three lenses of identical aperture area (100 × 100 × 6.35 mm3) but different unit cell sizes (0.5λ94 GHz, 0.53λ94 GHz, and 0.62λ94 GHz) are designed, fabricated, and tested. It is found that the maximum OPE is reduced from about 65° to less than 25°, aperture efficiency is improved by about 13.4% at 94 GHz, and the total number of unit cells is reduced by about 42.6% when periodicity changed from 0.47λ94 GHz to 0.62λ94 GHz, respectively. Furthermore, lens of 0.62λ94 GHz periodicity will have the highest aperture efficiency of 48.7%, gain = 37.8 dB at 94 GHz, beamwidth ≈1.2°, F/B ratio ≈37.5 dB, measured |S11| <; -10 dB, cross-pol <; -27dBandoffersSLLH <; -24.3dB,andSLLE <; -18.5 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2456978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160702","Aperture efficiency;lens antennas;phase error;Aperture efficiency;lens antennas;phase error","Lenses;Antenna measurements;Horn antennas;Aperture antennas;Dielectric losses","","11","","40","IEEE","16 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The AMC surface is well known to achieve low-profile and higher gain wire antennas. From a practical point of view, impedance matching is of paramount importance to achieve highly efficient reception of weak ambient RF energy. First, the driving-point impedance of a loop antenna over an AMC surface was studied, where a conventional method using image theory to estimate the impedance was found to be not always useful for loop antennas. As the AMC surface is within the reactive near field, mutual coupling between the antenna and the AMC unit cells is significant, which the conventional method does not take into account. Then, we proposed a novel use of a polarization-dependent AMC surface for dual-band RF energy harvesting. An AMC surface with a rectangular unit cell was adopted for two orthogonal polarizations with different frequencies. Finally, the AMC surface and the loop antennas were successfully implemented as a dual-band energy harvesting panel together with RF-to-dc conversion circuits and a power management circuit.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2459132","Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; Research and Development of Radio Wave Energy Harvesting; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163525","Periodic structures;UHF antennas;impedance matching;rectennas;energy harvesting;Energy harvesting;impedance matching;periodic structures;rectennas;UHF antennas","Surface impedance;Metals;Dipole antennas;Antenna theory;Impedance;Surface waves","","39","","25","IEEE","21 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This step is realized by optimizing phase excitations of the utilized antenna elements. In the next step, a thermal analysis is used to determine the scaling factor of the antennas' excitation amplitudes to realize the required temperature at the tumor position. A closed-loop procedure ensures that there are no hot spots in any of the healthy tissues. The technique is tested in a realistic environment which includes three-dimensional breast models and antenna arrays.

Based on this RBC, the direct volumetric discretization of graphene layer is avoided. Instead of directly deriving the numerical flux for DGTD considering the presence of this anisotropic and dispersive RBC, an auxiliary surface polarization current governed by a first-order time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE) is introduced over the graphene with the purpose to obtain an isotropic and simultaneously nondispersive RBC. In this way, the new formulated numerical flux expression derived from the Rankine–Hugoniot jump relations is isotropic, and no time-domain convolution is involved in the finalized matrix equations. To verify the applicability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm, the Faraday rotation and the surface plasmon resonance of a plane wave through magnetically biased graphene are investigated. For open-region scattering problems, a hybrid DGTD and time-domain boundary integral (TDBI) method is applied to rigorously truncate the computational domain.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2456977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160688","Auxiliary differential equation (ADE);anisotropic resistive boundary condition (RBC);discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method;magnetized graphene;time-domain boundary integral (TDBI) algorithm;Anisotropic resistive boundary condition (RBC);auxiliary differential equation (ADE);discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method;magnetized graphene;time-domain boundary integral (TDBI) algorithm","Graphene;Time-domain analysis;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Magnetostatics;Magnetic domains;Conductivity","","37","","30","IEEE","16 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The minimization procedures are usually iterative, and require the gradient of the objective function in the unknown model parameter vector in each stage of iteration. For large N, finite differencing becomes numerically intensive, and an efficient alternative is domain differentiation in which the full gradient is obtained by solving a single scattering problem of an auxiliary field using the same scattering operator as that of the forward solution. A well-known technique in this direction is the so-called adjoint field method, which obtains the gradient by variationally minimizing an augmented objective function that includes the reduced wave equation via a Lagrange multiplier. Results are reported mostly for compact objects. This paper presents the domain derivative calculation of the gradient for an one-dimensional, locally perturbed, and infinitely long dielectric interface. The method is nonvariational and algebraic in nature in that it evaluates the gradient by directly domain differentiating the scattering equations. The computations are straightforward and easy to follow. The mathematical transformation of the scattering problem into the corresponding problem for the differentiated fields can be visualized explicitly. The formulation of and the motivation behind introducing the auxiliary field are explicitly demonstrated. Closed-form analytic expressions are obtained for the gradients for electromagnetic TE/TM scattering from dielectric rough surfaces and for scalar wave scattering from Neumann and Dirichlet rough surfaces. Results are compared with those of compact scatterers. Finally, the relationship between our results and Lorentz reciprocity is pointed out and clarified.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2463682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7174979","Scattering;locally perturbed;dielectric rough surface;domain differentiation;Eulerian derivative;Dielectric rough surface;domain differentiation;Eulerian derivative;locally perturbed;scattering","Surface waves;Antennas;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Electromagnetic scattering;Boundary conditions","","3","","49","USGov","3 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The quick and exact calculation of patterns for distorted reflectors is an important research topic. In this communication, based on the previous works, a novel pattern approximation method using piecewise linear fitting is presented. The exponential error term in the physical optics (PO) formulation is first approximated by a series of straight lines through the piecewise linear fitting by least-square algorithm. Then, the radiation integral on each structural element is expressed as the summation of the ideal term and perturbation term, which are both weighted by the combinations of coefficients of the corresponding straight lines. Finally, the far field is derived as a simple linear function of structural nodal displacements in a matrix form by assembling the radiation integrals on all the structural elements. Simulation results show that the proposed method (PM) could save the storage space because there is no second-order term of the nodal displacements, facilitate rapid calculation by recalling the prestored data, and has high calculation accuracy even for large size of surface-error profiles.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2456932","National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program(grant numbers:2015CB857100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51490660,51205301); Foundation for Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2014KL012); 111 Project(grant numbers:B14042); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7159030","Reflector antennas;pattern analysis;piecewise linear fitting;matrix assembly;Matrix assembly;pattern analysis;piecewise linear fitting;reflector antennas","Approximation methods;Finite element analysis;Fitting;Taylor series;Piecewise linear approximation;Accuracy;Reflector antennas","","18","","27","IEEE","15 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the wideband characteristic of the SIW horn antenna is achieved through loading a dielectric slab with gradually decreasing dielectric constants, which can be realized through simply perforating different air vias on the extended slab. Second, in order to sustain an efficient feeding for the relatively thick substrate (0.27λ0), an additional metal ground is inserted in the middle of the grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW). Moreover, a triangular-shaped transition structure is placed at the end of the ECPW to smoothly transmit the energy from the thin ECPW to the thick SIW horn antenna. Finally, a prototype is fabricated to validate the proposed concept. Measured results indicate that the proposed horn antenna operates from 17.4 to 24 GHz. Stable radiation patterns can be observed in the whole operating band. The measured results show good accordance with the simulated ones.

To meet the requirements for a CHF detection system, the antenna is designed to have a compact size, wideband at the ultra-high frequency band and unidirectional radiation. To that end, several techniques are applied to the main utilized structure, which is a conventional loop antenna. To lower the resonant frequency and enhance the directivity within a compact size, the loop is capacitively loaded using a pair of slots. To compensate for the effect of the capacitive coupling on the input impedance matching, an inductive reactance is added by meandering the loop's structure. With the applied modifications, the proposed antenna has a compact size of 0.21 × 0.21 with respect to the wavelength at the lowest operating frequency. The realized dimension represents only a quarter of the size of its counterpart planar designs. The proposed antenna achieves a wide measured fractional bandwidth of 50% (0.66-1.1 GHz), 9 dB peak front-to-back ratio and 4.1 dBi gain. The antenna is then used as part of a CHF detection system that also includes a compact transceiver, scanning platform, and laptop for control and processing.

The electrical contact at the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) junction points may cause the degradation of reflectivity performance, and the concept of MIM junctions is mainly used for the analysis of passive intermodulation (PIM) arising from metallic contact in the practical antennas. In this work, a three-dimensional (3-D) modeling of mesh surfaces is presented, which introduced impedance connections at the wire junctions of metallic contact area. The electrical contact model of impedance connections is equivalent to a circuit model, which is considered as lumped boundary condition extended to the modeling of mesh. The planar mesh reflection coefficients are constructed using a full-wave frequency domain method with Floquet mode expansion. To calculate the electrical performance of curved mesh antenna, a solid surface with an equivalent loss is adopted to replace the mesh surfaces. The reflection coefficients of the equivalent loss material are the same as for the mesh surfaces. The analysis of the planar mesh reflectors with three different connections (solid surface, perfect contact, and lumped connection) at junction points is performed as an example for the proposed model. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the model in accurate performance prediction of mesh reflector antennas.

Simulations and measurements are presented for a thin diffraction grating, designed to operate in the VHF band in unfavorable outdoor conditions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2462090","Airbus; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7172478","Aircraft landing guidance;Bragg scattering;Buildings;Electromagnetic Diffraction;Radar Signature;Resonators;Aircraft landing guidance;Bragg scattering;buildings;electromagnetic diffraction;radar signature;resonators","Diffraction;Diffraction gratings;Buildings;Antenna measurements;Resonant frequency;Sensitivity;Antenna radiation patterns","","1","","12","IEEE","29 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A novel hybrid meander line and loop configuration is employed to transform linearly polarized field to circularly polarized field over a wide frequency band. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed polarizer is robust under oblique and deflected illuminations. A prototype of the proposed polarizer is designed and fabricated. Measured results show that the band of axial ratio less than 3 dB ranges from 18 to 29 GHz with about 3-dB insertion loss.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2462128","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2014M550782); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7169553","Circular polarizer;meander line;polarization convertor;single-layer structure;Circular polarizer;meander line;polarization convertor;single-layer structure","Bandwidth;Insertion loss;Frequency selective surfaces;Strips;Lighting;Polarization","","96","","17","IEEE","28 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna structure simply consists of a center-fed patch and eight shorting vias each of which is surrounded by a modified elliptical-ring slot. The θ-polarization of the proposed antenna is provided by the shorting vias and the coaxial probe, while the φ-polarization is generated by the modified elliptical-ring slots. Moreover, the amplitudes of the two orthogonal polarizations can be controlled separately and are less sensitive to the size of the metal platform. By employing the even and odd modes of the elliptical-ring slot, the proposed antenna exhibits a wide impedance bandwidth. A prototype of the antenna is fabricated and mounted on three ground planes, which function as electrically large metal platforms, with the radii of λ0, 2λ0, and 10λ0. The measured results show that the wideband CP antenna with these three ground planes have the 10-dB impedance bandwidths of 19.4%, 19.5%, and 19.9%, and the corresponding 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidths of 25.3%, 25.6%, and 24.8%, respectively. A detailed analysis on the radiation characteristics is also carried out for small to extremely large ground plane extensions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2464086","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61201018,61401327,61471278,61501343); Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(grant numbers:20130203120011,20120203120011); National Basic Research Program of China 973(grant numbers:2015CB857100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7174978","Wideband;circular-polarization;conical-beam;modified elliptical-ring slots;shorting vias;large ground plane;Circular-polarization;conical-beam;large ground plane;modified elliptical-ring slots;shorting vias;wideband","Antenna measurements;Impedance;Wideband;Broadband antennas;Slot antennas","","21","","10","IEEE","3 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
