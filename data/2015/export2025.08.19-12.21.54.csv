By properly designing the coupling coefficients between two pairs of coupled resonators, the network can effectively reduce the mutual couplings between two coupled dual-band antennas in two bands simultaneously. The new scheme is proved by a practical microstrip version of the device for two dual-band antennas working at 2.4 and 5.2 GHz frequency bands. A compact planar dual-band CRDN consisting of a pair of dual-band open-loop square ring resonators is proposed. The measured scattering parameters of two coupled antennas with and without the dual-band CRDN in free space (FS) and with hand phantom demonstrate that the isolation between the two antennas in both the low and high bands can be improved from 8 to 10 dB, respectively, to below 20 dB while maintaining a good matching performance. The total efficiency and envelop correlation coefficient for the decoupled antennas show a significant improvement as compared to the coupled antenna case. The proposed dual-band CRDN scheme is easy to be implemented in an integrated device, and is very attractive for practical multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2421973","Postgraduate scholarship of The Chinese University of Hong Kong; Development and Reform Commission of Shenzhen Municipality(grant numbers:Shen Fa Gai (2013) 1673); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7084186","Compact antenna array;Coupled Resonators;Dual-band;Decoupling network;MIMO;Mutual coupling;Compact antenna array;coupled resonators;decoupling network;dual-band;multiple input and multiple output (MIMO);mutual coupling","Dual band;Antennas;Admittance;Couplings;Antenna measurements;Scattering parameters;Resonant frequency","","160","","25","IEEE","10 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One patch is driven with two orthogonal feeds for CP operation, whereas the other patch is a parasitic one of tunable electrical size for beam scanning. The parasitic patch is loaded with a narrow square slot and four lumped varactors along with their dc biasing network to effectively tune its electrical size. Because the main beam direction is determined by the electrical size of the parasitic patch, electronic beam scanning is allowed by changing the capacitance value through the applied reverse dc biasing voltage. An antenna prototype has been fabricated for experimental validation. Operating at 2.45 GHz, the antenna performance shows a monotonic CP beam scanning that ranges from -36° to 3° with a 0.48-6.64 pF tuning capacitance.

It has high computation efficiency for the optimization design of TMAs, especially for nonuniformly spaced TMAs. The proposed approach, using the in-array mutual impedance to describe the effect of mutual coupling, is based on a closed-form mutual impedance expression and a correcting procedure. The closed-form is used to calculate the mutual impedance between two isolated elements in which the effect of the parasitic elements is ignored. Then, the correcting procedure, which only requires the knowledge of the isolated element input impedance and the mutual impedance of two isolated elements, is used to obtain a corrected in-array mutual impedance, in which the interactions between the antennas in the array configuration are involved. Because it makes use of the surface mode currents to calculate the mutual coupling effects, the currents induced on the parasitic elements are naturally involved. Therefore, the corrected in-array mutual impedance is a good approximation of the real one. In addition, the impedance variations can occur in phase-scanned TMAs due to mutual coupling effects, resulting in a significant fraction of the incident power being reflected known as mismatch losses. Based on the proposed approach, an introduced phase-scanned TMA makes use of SP3T switches and optimized time sequences for the element feed to reduce the mismatch losses in comparison with a conventional phase-scanned TMA. To validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach, examples of the optimization design of uniformly and nonuniformly spaced time-modulated patch arrays for different scenarios are presented. All the results obtained from the proposed approach are given and compared with those from the commercial software.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2421943","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7084184","Antenna array;mutual coupling;scan impedance;time modulation;Antenna array;mutual coupling;scan impedance;time modulation","Impedance;Optimization;Mutual coupling;Antenna arrays;Transmission line matrix methods;Modulation;Antenna radiation patterns","","27","","30","IEEE","10 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna array, conducting transmitter/receiver beamforming, is often used to enhance the transmission range. However, to conduct beamforming, the transceivers have to know the angles of signal arrival. Many angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation algorithms are well known. Unfortunately, most of them are developed for digital arrays, requiring an analog-to-digital-converter (ADC) and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for each antenna element. For an array with a large number of antennas, the implementation cost will be very high. Recently, hybrid antenna array, in which multiple antennas share an ADC/DAC, was proposed as a low-cost solution. However, the existing AoA estimation algorithms for hybrid arrays can only support one AoA; their applications are then limited in multipath indoor environments. In this paper, we propose new AoA estimation algorithms to solve the problem. Using an augmented beam-space approach, we extend the use of the well-known AoA estimation algorithms, MUSIC and ESPRIT developed for digital arrays, to the scenario of hybrid antenna arrays. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms, although developed for hybrid arrays, can have similar performance as MUSIC and ESPRIT in digital arrays.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2426795","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(grant numbers:102-2219-E-009-004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7097001","Hybrid array;AoA estimation;MUSIC;ESPRIT;hybrid beamforming;Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation;ESPRIT;hybrid array;hybrid beamforming;MUSIC","Antenna arrays;Estimation;Array signal processing;Multiple signal classification;OFDM;Correlation","","95","","27","IEEE","28 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method exhibits two advantages: 1) it is inherently vectorial, and therefore better suited for full vectorial (beyond paraxial) electromagnetic problems; 2) it provides closed-form solutions, and is therefore extremely fast. Incidentally, the method reveals that a metasurface is fundamentally capable to transform up to four independent wave triplets (incident, reflected, and refracted waves). In addition, this paper provides the closed-form expressions relating the synthesized susceptibilities and the scattering parameters simulated within periodic boundary conditions, which allows one to design the scattering particles realizing the desired susceptibilities. The versatility of the method is illustrated by examples of metasurfaces achieving the following transformations: generalized refraction, reciprocal and nonreciprocal polarization rotation, Bessel vortex beam generation, and orbital angular momentum multiplexing.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2423700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7088589","Metasurface;metamaterial;susceptibility tensor;boundary conditions;distributions;surface discountinuity;Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs);Boundary conditions;distributions;generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs);metamaterial;metasurface;surface discountinuity;susceptibility tensor","Boundary conditions;Tensile stress;Scattering;Magnetic susceptibility;Electromagnetics;Transforms;Scattering parameters","","343","","26","IEEE","17 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this contribution, a space-time Galerkin discretization of the TD-EFIE is proposed, which separates the loop and star components of both the equation and the unknown. Judiciously integrating or differentiating these components with respect to time leads to an equation which is free from dc instability. By choosing the correct temporal basis and testing functions for each of the components, a stable MOT system is obtained. Furthermore, the scaling of these basis and testing functions ensure that the system remains well conditioned for large-time steps.

The resulting system of equations cannot be solved by a straightforward application of the marching on-in-time (MOT) scheme since the two-sided APSW interpolation functions require the knowledge of unknown “future” field samples during time marching. Causality of the MOT scheme is restored using an extrapolation technique that predicts the future samples from known “past” ones.

This increases the stability of the MOT-TD-EFVIE solver significantly, since the temporal behavior of decaying and oscillating electromagnetic modes induced inside the scatterers is very accurately taken into account by this new extrapolation scheme.

Some numerical examples highlight the accuracy and the effectiveness of the proposed UTD ray solution for vertex diffraction.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2427877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7097689","Asymptotic diffraction theory;diffraction;geometrical theory of diffraction;uniform theory of diffraction;Asymptotic diffraction theory;diffraction;geometrical theory of diffraction;uniform theory of diffraction","Diffraction;Surface waves;Optical surface waves;Method of moments;Scattering;Standards;Optical diffraction","","23","","25","IEEE","29 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This near-field information gain due to scattering was recently anticipated by Janaswamy using a stochastic source model, it is extended here to arbitrary sources, and it is shown to disappear in the limit of large radiating systems. It is also shown that the same information gain and asymptotic cut-off occurs for the singular values of the field radiating in free space.

The methods of EEC present some ambiguity in the definition of currents at general edge points, which do not satisfy the diffraction law. Modified edge representation (MER) is a unique concept for a complete definition of EEC with simple and classical Keller-type knife-edge diffraction coefficients. Although singularities in the definition of EEC exist, the line integration of MER EEC results uniform and accurate fields everywhere including geometrical boundaries except for the case of grazing incidence, where reflection and incidence shadow boundaries (RSB and ISB) are close to each other. In this paper, fringe wave (FW) part of MER EEC is modified by introducing the weighting in terms of Fresnel zone number (FZN) distance from the reflection point to improve the accuracy at and near shadow boundaries even in grazing incidence. Next, the corner diffraction, a contribution coming from edge point which does not satisfy the diffraction law, is extracted in MER by introducing another weighting function using the FZN distance from scattering centers on edge. Its remarkable accuracy fully validates MER EECs at general edge points. The dipole wave scattering from flat square and triangular plates are discussed with numerical examples.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2429751","The Research and Development for Expansion of Radio Wave Resources; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7101816","corner diffraction;equivalent edge current (EEC);Fresnel zone;geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD);modified edge representation(MER);uniform theory of diffraction (UTD);Corner diffraction;equivalent edge current (EEC);Fresnel zone;geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD);modified edge representation (MER);uniform theory of diffraction (UTD)","Diffraction;Observers;Accuracy;Scattering;Optical diffraction;Physical optics;Image edge detection","","10","","35","IEEE","5 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By evaluating the diversity metric, using simulation and measurement data, it is shown that the performance of such a system is stable throughout the entire investigated frequency band for both indoor and outdoor environments. There is a good agreement between the simulated and measured diversity values with a deviation of less than 9%. Therefore, the proposed technique optimizes the antennas' positions for maximum diversity performance within a very broad frequency band, independent of the used wireless communication standard.

From the large set of LoS and OLoS measured data, the parameters for single-slope path loss model with shadowing are devised. Furthermore, the analysis of multipath propagation is performed. The results show that strong multiple reflections from the transmitter and receiver electronics are present both in LoS and OLoS environments.

The channel metrics are compared separately for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) situations. Most power contributions arise from the LOS component (if present) as well as from multipaths with single bounce reflections. Measurement and simulation results of the received power show a very good agreement in the presence of LOS, as most of the received power is carried by the LOS component. In NLOS, the difference is large because the ray-tracer is unable to capture some of the channel characteristics due to the underlying limitations of our ray-based propagation model. Despite the limitations, the model is suitable to characterize some, but not all, of the channel properties in a sufficient manner. We find that the diffuse scattering and multibounced nonspecular reflections must be considered for an accurate prediction of the channel in such a rich scattering environment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2428280","Lunds Universitet; Technische Universität Braunschweig(grant numbers:COST IC 1004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7098333","Ray-tracing;Simulations;Channel Measurements;Vehicle-to-Vehicle;MIMO;Radio Propagation;channel characterization;Channel characterization;channel measurements;MIMO;radio propagation;ray-tracing (RT);simulations;vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)","Antenna measurements;Ray tracing;Buildings;Gain measurement;Scattering;Vehicles;Gain","","96","","30","IEEE","30 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The RiMAX maximum-likelihood estimator is used to extract the full-polarimetric SMC and DMC from the measurement data by taking into account the polarimetric radiating patterns of the dual-polarized antennas. Cross-polar discrimination (XPD) and copolar ratio (CPR) values are presented from the measured and de-embedded channels, as well as the polarimetric delay and angular spread distributions. Strong de-embedded SMC depolarization is obtained for the horizontal polarization in OLOS scenarios. Additionally, DMC depolarization is observed to be weaker than previously reported for indoor environments but constant across LOS/OLOS, polarization, and distance. The results also show that the copolar (cross-polar) DMC power to total channel power ratio is equal to 15% (40%) for LOS and 40% (60%) for OLOS and that this ratio does not correlate significantly with transmitter-receiver distance.

To alleviate this problem, a pulsed-FDA is proposed with an aim to generate quasi-static beampattern in this communication.

Thus, the dielectric waveguide model (DWM) method can be used to predict the resonant frequency and field distributions of the omnidirectional mode of rectangular DRA.

This scheme is facet-oriented and therefore, well suited for the scattering analysis of nonconformal meshes or composite objects. The observed accuracy, though, is only competitive with respect to the RWG-discretization for a restricted range of heights of the tetrahedral elements. In this communication, we introduce a novel implementation of the volumetric monopolar-RWG discretization of the EFIE with testing over a set of wedges. We show with RCS and near-field results that this scheme offers improved accuracy for a wider range of heights than the approach with tetrahedral testing. The application of the wedge testing to the even-surface odd-volumetric monopolar-RWG discretization of the EFIE, edge-oriented and therefore less versatile, shows similar accuracy as with tetrahedral testing, which is a sign of robustness.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2426793","Spanish Interministerial Commission on Science and Technology; European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:TEC2010-20841-C04-02,TEC2012-37582-C04-02,CONSOLIDER CSD2008-00068); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7096972","Integral Equations;Moment method;Basis functions;Electric Field Integral Equation;Basis functions;electric-field integral equation (EFIE);integral equations;moment method","Testing;Accuracy;Antennas;IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation;Integral equations;Conductors;Tin","","18","","10","IEEE","28 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
