Amongst others, this development is driven by an increasing number of subscribers exchanging larger and larger data volumes. This need of data capacity cannot be satisfied alone by raising the sheer number of communications satellites, but requires powerful individual systems, which operate reliably and are cost effective at the same time. In this context two requirements on the communications antenna are the provision of high directional gain and robustness in terms of beam stability. Classically, large unfurlable mesh reflector antennas in conjunction with feed arrays are adopted to illuminate a certain region on ground with high gain. An inherent problem of such reflector-feed configurations is that these systems are prone to feed element failures. In the worst case, this could result in a `blind' spot, where no communication is possible. This paper introduces a robust antenna concept, which combines the virtue of reflector antennas, namely the large aperture, with the advantage of direct radiating planar array antennas, which is the beam stability in the presence of element failures. In order to unfold its full potential this concept makes use of digital beamforming techniques, which allow to control the illumination in a flexible way.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2386301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6998948","Defocused;digital beamforming (DBF);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);reflector antennas;satellite communications","Antenna arrays;Gain;Array signal processing;Antenna feeds;Context;Robustness","","8","","13","IEEE","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This antenna farm, using typically three or four reflectors to produce the full dual-band (Tx/Rx) multiple beam coverage, provides high performance but leaves no or little room on the spacecraft for other missions. Accommodation constraints and the desire of operators to maximize and diversify their revenues per satellite have led to several studies on innovative antenna solutions enabling to reduce the number of reflector apertures. Multiple-feed-per-beam (MFB) antenna configurations, using only two apertures, are currently under development for broadband missions at Ka-band. C-band is a more mature business and operators are contemplating the possibility to apply the benefits of multiple beam antennas (MBA) to this frequency band. Due to the lower operating frequency, accommodation constraints are even more stringent and although still scarcely discussed, MFB antenna configurations at C-band are clearly of interest. This paper presents investigations on this topic. In particular, it is found that the MFB architecture applied in C-band is a more realistic approach when compared to the SFB option. Beam Forming Networks (BFNs) with periodic structure is the key to get compact feed clusters that can be allocated in large and medium-size platforms. A new four color scheme compatible with a very compact MFB feed array architecture is introduced.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2395444","ESA ARTES 5.1 program “Compact C-Band Feed Assembly for Single and Multi-Beam Missions”; definition of the multibeam missions; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7018051","beam forming network;C-band;multibeam;offset reflector;reflector antennas;satellite communication;Beam forming network (BFN);C-band;multibeam;offset reflector;reflector antennas;satellite communication","Arrays;Feeds;Color;Standards;Apertures;Satellite antennas","","48","","25","EU","22 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Further technical solutions, such as slotted ground plane, combined with AMM, have allowed for an outstanding profile reduction, while preserving high radiation efficiency and low back radiation. Innovative testing methodologies have been specifically developed to handle truncation errors and echo signals while performing radiation pattern measurement of the array on a full-scale mockup platform in a hemispherical automotive near field (NF) range.

By tuning the dc-bias voltage across the gap, the dielectric properties of the BST layer are changed and then an integrated tunable capacitor is realized. The proposed design is evaluated using both full-wave simulations and measurements. Due to the monolithic integration of the tuning mechanism with the unit cell, the antenna element can be applied at millimeter-wave frequencies without suffering from packaging and bonding problems. The effects of substrate thickness, system pressure, and operating frequency on the performance of the BST-integrated unit cell are presented. An overall phase range of 298° and 263° with maximum reflection losses of 16 and 8.8 dB at Ka- and X-bands, respectively, are measured when the unit cells are operated for maximum phase range. By judiciously selecting the frequency of operation, a phase range of 250° with maximum reflection losses of 5.6 and 5.8 dB at 30.7 and 10.27 GHz are achieved.

Pursuant to this goal, we present an ultrawideband, tightly coupled dipole array (TCDA) capable of supporting numerous satellite communication bands, simultaneously. Such antennas enable weight reduction by replacing multiple antennas. In addition, it provides spectral efficiency by reusing intermediate frequencies for inter-satellite communication. For ease of fabrication, the array is initially designed for operation across the UHF, L, S, and lower-C bands (0.6-3.6 GHz), with emphasis on dual-linear polarization, and wide-angle scanning. The array achieves a minimum 6:1 bandwidth for VSWR less than 1.8, 2.4, and 3.1 for 0°, 45°, and 60° scans, respectively. The presented design represents the first practical realization of dual polarizations using a TCDA topology. This is accomplished through a dual-offset, split unit cell with minimized inter-feed coupling. Array simulations are verified with measured results of an 8 × 8 prototype, exhibiting very low cross polarization and near-theoretical gain across the band. Further, we present a TCDA design operating across the upper-S, C, X, and Ku bands (3-18 GHz). The array achieves this 6:1 bandwidth for VSWR <; 2 at broadside, and VSWR <; 2.6 at 45°.

The combination of these factors has posed numerous engineering challenges for antenna system designers, often forming complex tradeoffs among design parameters such as bandwidth, pattern control, beamwidth, and antenna size. In this paper, we show how a challenging set of antenna requirements were met for NASA's recent LADEE mission. We focus on the difficulties inherent in the requirements for both omnidirectional and medium gain antennas, both in S-band. We present techniques used to develop a requirements-compliant system based on our research in antenna synthesis methods. Compared to the conventional antennas considered by NASA for the mission, the antennas we developed yielded 65% increased downlink coverage and 44% cost savings for the mission.
