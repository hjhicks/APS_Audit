Such devices can be used to create electromagnetic radiation and to alleviate the platform effect associated with low-profile conformal antennas. In this paper, a bulk acoustic wave (BAW)-mediated multiferroic antenna structure is proposed. Its potential for efficient radiation of electromagnetic waves is evaluated by analytically deriving the lower bound of its radiation quality factor (Q factor). A one-dimensional (1-D) multiscale finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique is developed to predict the bilateral, dynamic coupling between the acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves. The simulation shows a decaying stress profile in the BAW resonator structure, which implies that the radiation of the electromagnetic waves acts as a damping load to the acoustic resonance. The simulated radiation Q factor matches well with the analytical derivations and the agreement validates both the operating principle of the proposed antenna and the FDTD algorithm developed. The study concludes that efficient antennas may be realized at GHz frequencies with thin film multiferroic material that has thicknesses of the order of 10-5 wavelength.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2431723","U.S. National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement Award(grant numbers:EEC-1160504); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7105385","bulk acoustic waves (BAW);conformal antennas;film bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR);finite difference time domain method;multiferroic antennas;multiferroic material;platform effect;Bulk acoustic waves (BAW);conformal antennas;film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs);finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method;multiferroic antennas;multiferroic material;platform effect","Magnetic flux;Magnetostriction;Antennas;Strain;Magnetoacoustic effects;Stress","","170","7","31","IEEE","11 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The channel measurements are conducted in a nonlossy reverberation chamber (RC), a lossy RC, a corridor, and an office room. For both antennas, the measured average correlation coefficients (CCs) in the nonlossy RC are the smallest, close to 0.1, in the lossy RC are the largest, 0.3-0.5, and in the two indoor scenarios are slightly larger than that in the nonlossy RC. Except for the signal correlation, the relative path loss (RPL) should also be included to fairly compare the channel capacities. If the RPL is considered, a strong dependence of the channel capacity on the propagation properties can be seen. For both antennas, the channel capacities in the two indoor scenarios are 20%-30% smaller than that in the nonlossy RC. Interestingly, both antennas have similar condition numbers (CNs) in all the four scenarios, whose PDFs are close to that of the independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian channel, which reveals that both antennas can obtain nearly three independent parallel subchannels and good multiplexing performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2435058","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61201235); Young Talents Program of Beijing Universities(grant numbers:YETP0595); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110355","Tri-polarized loop (TPL);tri-polarized dipole (TPD);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);measurement;Measurement;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);tripolarized dipole (TPD);tripolarized loop (TPL)","Antenna measurements;Dipole antennas;MIMO;Frequency measurement;Loss measurement","","26","","20","IEEE","19 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This beam-scanning technique relies on a patch antenna element that can be microfluidically repositioned at the focal plane of a microwave lens. The feed network is strategically designed to be passive and accommodate the position variation in the antenna element. This paper, for the first time, considers the design details and performance evaluation of three different passive network layouts that can potentially be utilized to excite MFPAs. Specifically, resonant corporate, resonant straight, and nonresonant straight microstrip line feed networks are introduced and their loss/bandwidth performances are investigated using the transmission line theory. In addition, a method of moments and ray tracing-based hybrid analysis is utilized to demonstrate the impact of the proposed feed networks on the radiation properties of the MFPA in terms of realized gain and side lobe levels (SLLs). It is shown that the resonant and nonresonant straight microstrip line feed networks reduce the SLL by more than 10 dB relative to the resonant corporate feed network utilized in the prior work. The performance improvements are experimentally verified through an eight-element extended hemispherical dielectric lens-based MFPA prototype. Different than the recent work that relied on liquid metal, the antenna element of this MFPA is implemented from a metalized plate by carrying out flow characterizations on various microfluidic channel geometries. This metalized plate approach paves the way for reliable liquid-metal-free microfluidic reconfigurable devices with higher efficiency and power-handling capabilities.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2436441","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1351557,ECCS-1349096); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111259","Beam-Scanning;Focal Plane Array;Microfluidics;Reconfigurable Antennas;Beam-scanning;focal plane array (FPA);microfluidics;reconfigurable antennas","Feeds;Microfluidics;Bandwidth;Microstrip;Antenna arrays;Lenses","","16","","57","IEEE","21 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

F-K migration is known as a fast-imaging method in the F-K domain, while Kirchhoff migration is reported to be more accurate. However, Kirchhoff migration requires the reflection points to be located as a function of the antenna position and the delay time. This prevents the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) because Kirchhoff migration must be processed in the time domain, and this can be extremely time consuming. The proposed algorithm overcomes this hurdle by introducing the texture angle and the inverse boundary scattering transform (IBST). These two tools enable the locations of the reflection points to be determined rapidly for each pixel of a radar image. The radar signals are then modified according to the Kirchhoff integral, before Stolt F-K migration is applied in the frequency domain to produce an accurate radar image. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, the conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) migration, Kirchhoff migration, Stolt F-K migration, and the proposed method are applied to the same measured datasets.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2431725","Supporting Program for Interaction-based Initiative Team Studies (SPIRITS); Japan–Netherlands joint development of sleep monitoring technology using ultra-wideband radar; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research Abroad; Center of Innovation Program; JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:25249057,15K18077); The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7105356","ultra-wideband;radar imaging;Stolt F-K migration;Kirchhoff migration;inverse boundary scattering transform;Inverse boundary scattering transform (IBST);Kirchhoff migration;radar imaging;Stolt F-K migration;ultra-wideband (UWB)","Radar imaging;Imaging;Antenna measurements;Scattering;Receivers;Transforms","","37","","20","IEEE","11 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to complexity of human body tissues, microwave signals that enter a human organ from different angles and are reflected at different depths inside that organ face different effective dielectric constants. An accurate estimation of those dielectric constants is vital for an accurate estimation of signal speed within the imaged object and thus accurate resultant images. The traditional confocal algorithm uses one preassumed effective dielectric constant and thus its resultant image is sensitive to that assumption. In the proposed approach, position-dependent dielectric constants are used to generate a highly focused image that accurately maps scatterers within an imaged object. To that end, an objective equation based on the focusing degree of the obtained initial image is created. Then, particle swarm optimization (PSO) uses that equation to find the effective dielectric constants facing signals penetrating the object according to their entrance point. Those optimized effective dielectric constants are used to produce a highly focused image without the risk of creating false-positive targets irrespective of the initial values of the effective dielectric constants. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in head imaging via full-wave electromagnetic simulations and experiments. The simulations are based on using an accurate numerical head model, whereas the experiments are conducted using realistic artificial head phantoms. The obtained images indicate that the quality of the images is significantly improved with more accurate localization of targets in unhealthy cases and less probability of positive false alarms in healthy cases compared with the traditional approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2434394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109867","Optimization;confocal imaging;microwave imaging;particle swarm optimization;Confocal imaging;microwave imaging;optimization;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Head;Dielectric constant;Antennas;Microwave imaging;Optimization;Numerical models","","63","1","27","IEEE","18 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We conduct this investigation for a multifrequency formulation of DBIM, wherein the dispersive breast tissue properties are described with a Debye model. The parameters of the Debye model for the initial guess are linearly linked to reflect typical breast tissue dielectric properties. The static permittivity characterizing the properties is swept over an appropriate range of initial guesses and DBIM is used to obtain imaging results for each guess. Image quality and the number of iterations required for convergence is evaluated using three-dimensional (3-D) anatomically realistic numerical breast phantoms. This investigation not only vividly illustrates the sensitivity of DBIM to the initial guess but also definitively demonstrates that the use of initial values close to the average properties of the breast yields near-optimal performance.

Based on direct application of the boundary conditions with the uniqueness theorem and the use of random equivalent problems concept, more degrees-of-freedom to the sources' positions are added resulting in significantly efficient solutions with lower memory requirements. The technique does not require any singularity treatment due to placing the equivalent sources away from the boundaries. While boundary conditions are not enforced exactly, an iterative framework is introduced that can achieve an acceptable level of error in their satisfaction for an arbitrary, randomly generated set of equivalent sources. The presented technique promises a significant reduction in the execution time and memory requirements compared to the surface-equivalent-based method of moments (MoM). The solution stability, repeatability, and numerical noise susceptibility are investigated thoroughly through this work. Also, a novel edge correction scheme has been implemented to extend the capabilities of this procedure to structures with sharp edges. The results of the presented technique are compared to series solutions for conducting spheres and a commercially available MoM code for arbitrarily shaped objects and combinations of different materials.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2438339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7114252","Frequency domain analysis;Electromagnetic scattering;Random Auxiliary Method;RAS;Fast Methods;Electromagnetic (EM) scattering;fast methods;frequency domain analysis;random auxiliary source (RAS) method","Boundary conditions;Method of moments;Optimization;Accuracy;Electromagnetic scattering;Stability analysis","","12","","39","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the required Green's function has no analytical expression (in general), buried object approach (BOA) is applied to calculate it numerically. Method of moments (MoM) is then used to solve the EFIE. The presented method is numerically validated by comparing it with finite difference time-domain (FDTD) method.

However, deriving their transient analog is a challenge, as it involves an inverse Fourier transform of the spherical Hankel functions (and their derivatives) that are convolved with inverse Fourier transforms of spherical Bessel functions (and their derivatives). Series expansion of these convolutions is highly oscillatory (therefore, poorly convergent) and unstable. Indeed, the literature on numerical computation of this convolution is very sparse. In this paper, we present a novel quasi-analytical approach to compute transient Mie scattering that is both stable and rapidly convergent. The approach espoused here is to use vector tesseral harmonics as basis function for the currents in time-domain integral equations (TDIEs) together with a novel addition theorem for the Green's functions that render these expansions stable. This procedure results in an orthogonal, spatially meshfree, and singularity-free system, giving us a set of one-dimensional (1-D) Volterra Integral equations. Time-dependent multipole coefficients for each mode are obtained via a time-marching procedure. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to show the accuracy and stability of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2439294","HPCC facility at Michigan State University(grant numbers:NSF CCF-1018516,NSF CMMI-1250261,NSF ECCS-1408115); Department of Defense CREATE-RF Program; Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program Office HPCMPO; Computational Research and Engineering for Acquisition Tools and Environments CREATE; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7115079","Time-dependent Mie series;time-domain integral equations (TDIEs);Volterra integral equation;Time-dependent Mie series;time-domain integral equations (TDIEs);Volterra integral equation","Green's function methods;Integral equations;Harmonic analysis;Time-domain analysis;Kernel;Scattering;Fourier transforms","","9","","40","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We discuss how the reactive energy building up around the radiator affects quite strongly the flow of energy in the vicinity of the dipole, while in the far field, the expected radiation features are restored. The reactive energy in the near field decelerates or even inverts the overall energy flow, resulting in partial standing waves near the feed. We also investigate the transient response of the stored reactive energy and identify the convergence to steady state, which is demonstrated through time-averaged quantities. Our results shed interesting observations on the radiation properties of antennas in their near field, as time progresses.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2436410","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:13260996); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-13-1-0204); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111231","Dipole antennas;energy flow velocity;Poynting vector;reactive energy;Dipole antennas;energy flow velocity;Poynting vector;reactive energy","Dipole antennas;Electromagnetics;Harmonic analysis;Steady-state;Electromagnetic scattering;Convergence","","17","","20","EU","21 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed FSS structure has operation bands from closely spaced to far from each other (wide range of band ratio) and has high selectivity at each operation band. The unit cell comprises four small square slots, each loaded with multiple stub resonators. The stubs are placed in each slot in such a way that the unit cell response to both TE and TM polarizations are the same. To miniaturize the unit cell and cover the lower frequency range, each stub resonator is terminated with a U-shaped section. The length of each stubs within the slot determine the resonant frequency of each passbands. The band ratio can be set from 1.09 (close to each other) up to 2.35 (far from each other). Single, dual, triple, and quad band FSS structures are designed and simulated through HFSS software package. The fabricated dual-band unit cell shows that the proposed FSS structure can provide two close to each other bands, 9.8 and 10.9 GHz. Also, the measured results of a fabricated dual-band 17 × 17 FSS array show a relatively stable response to variations of incidence angle and polarization state.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2438340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7114227","Frequency Selective Surface;Multi-band;Slot Array;Frequency selective surface (FSS);multiband;slot array","Passband;Frequency selective surfaces;Arrays;Equivalent circuits;Resonant frequency;Dual band;Silicon","","60","","28","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, our study demonstrates that the CP radiation can be achieved at the broadside by setting a 90° phase difference between the verticaland horizontal-paired folded dipole radiators. Second, a radiation pattern subtraction approach is presented to explain how the radiation beamwidth of the paired folded dipoles could be appropriately widened or narrowed according to the radiation pattern subtraction of two opposite electric current densities in the folded dipoles. Using this approach, the E-plane beamwidth of a pair of folded dipoles is made certainly widened, whereas its H-plane counterpart becomes narrowed. On this basis, theEand H-plane radiation patterns can still be made approximately identical with each other over a wide range of polar angle, even though the distance between dipoles is deliberately shortened. As such, the desired CP antenna with shortened dipole-to-dipole distance and unaffected wide AR beamwidth can be achieved using two pairs of parallel folded dipoles with shortened distance between them instead of linear dipoles in [24]. Finally, a CP printed antenna is designed and fabricated on a single dielectric substrate. Experimental results are found in good agreement with the simulated ones in terms of radiation patterns, gain, AR, efficiency, and reflection coefficient. In particular, the 3-dB AR beamwidth at the central frequency of 1.6 GHz is extended to 135° at XZ-plane and 142° at YZ-plane. Moreover, the overall size of the constituted CP antenna with folded dipoles is decreased to 0.43 λ0 × 0.43 λ0 (λ0 is the wavelength in free space).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2438334","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61171029,61471172); Central Universities(grant numbers:2013ZP0018); State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave(grant numbers:K201406); Start-up Research(grant numbers:SRG2013-00043-FST); Multi-Year Research(grant numbers:MYRG2014-00079-FST); University of Macau; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7114250","circularly-polarized antenna;wide beamwidth;folded dipole and radiation pattern subtraction;Circularly polarized antenna;folded dipole and radiation pattern subtraction;wide beamwidth","Dipole antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna measurements;Frequency measurement;Substrates;Dielectric substrates","","61","","27","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This communication examines how the phase constant of a short LWA can be manipulated to achieve side lobe suppression. The tapering of the phase constant is shown to result in higher order “image patterns,” which can be used advantageously for side lobe suppression. Validation of this principle is given by a cosine-shaped width-tapering profile design of a half-mode substrate-integrated waveguide (HMSIW) LWA. The measured results show that the side lobe level (SLL) of a short (1.4 λ0) HMSIW LWA has been suppressed to below -16 dB in the entire space wave leakage region using this tapering profile.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2438399","Industrial Technology Research Institute(grant numbers:03-103-0004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7114255","Half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW);microstrip leaky wave antenna (LWA);side lobe level;Half-mode substrate-integrated waveguide (HMSIW);microstrip leaky wave antenna (LWA);side lobe level (SLL)","Antenna radiation patterns;Propagation constant;Leaky wave antennas;Manganese;Substrates;Approximation methods;Noise","","11","","18","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
