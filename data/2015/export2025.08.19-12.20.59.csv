To gain insight into what causes bandwidth fluctuations, a process for applying characteristic mode theory to the finite ground plane and feed structure was developed. Four different PIFA designs are then evaluated to show how the modal significance of certain modes on the finite ground plane relate to the bandwidth minima and maxima for each PIFA. Next, finite ground planes are altered using the gained insight to enlarge the bandwidth for an antenna with a fixed maximum ground plane size. The goal of this work is to use the developed bandwidth analysis technique to inform the synthesis of PIFAs that require broader bandwidths.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2374213","Army Research Office; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965575","Bandwidth;characteristic modes;finite ground planes;planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs)","Bandwidth;Antenna feeds;Slot antennas;Design methodology;Antenna theory","","38","","25","IEEE","24 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna is fabricated using conventional low-cost printed-circuit-board and plated-through-hole technologies and the patch size of the element has been enlarged by exploiting higher-order mode operation for good fabrication tolerance. The antenna element is a 0.86 guided wavelength ( λg at 60 GHz) long patch shorted at one end. A slot of 0.09 λg in width is introduced on the shorted patch and the distance between the slot center to the other end of the patch is 0.5 λg. The shorted patch resonates at TM30 mode and the 0.46 λg patch, created by presence of the slot, operates at TM10 mode. The combination of these two modes broadens the impedance bandwidth of the element to 18%. Asymmetric radiation patterns in the E-plane and large cross-polarization levels in the H-plane generated by a single patch are eradicated by feeding two mirrored elements differentially. The designed differentially-fed prototype has more than 18% measured impedance bandwidth, stable gain at 9-10 dBi and symmetric and stable radiation patterns across the operating band from 56 to 67 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2378263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977926","Bandwidth enhancement;differential feed;higher-order mode;millimeter wave;patch antenna","Pins;Wideband;Antenna radiation patterns;Fabrication;Patch antennas","","37","","30","IEEE","5 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A wideband circular-monopolar patch surrounded by eight reconfigurable coupling loop stubs can generate conical-beam radiation patterns with different polarizations. This polarization reconfigurable characteristic is realized by controlling PIN diodes on the coupling loop stubs. The center-fed circular patch operates with the vertically-polarized conical-beam radiation and the coupling loop stubs radiate the horizontally-polarized wave propagation. With choosing proper magnitudes and phase differences between the two orthogonal radiations from the monopolar patch and the loop stubs, a circularly-polarized conical-beam radiation can be obtained. In addition, the presence of a back reflector yields a wide axial ratio bandwidth, enhances the front-to-back ratio of the radiation pattern, and avoids EM interferences between DC biasing lines and the antenna. This proposed antenna can generate three types of polarizations with the conical-beam radiation pattern including vertical polarization, left-handed circular polarization, and right-handed circular polarization by controlling the PIN diodes. Measured impedance and axial ratio bandwidths are 28.6% (3.45 to 4.6 GHz) and 15.4% (3.6 to 4.2 GHz), respectively, for the two CP modes. The maximum CP gain is 4.4 dBic. Furthermore, a dual-band operation (3.35 to 3.44 GHz and 4.5 to 4.75 GHz) can be observed for the LP mode. The antenna can operate at the downlink of standard C band (3.625 to 4.2 GHz) for geostationary satellite communication.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2381263","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985569","Conical-beam radiation pattern;PIN diodes;polarization reconfigurable antenna;wideband monopolar patch","Bandwidth;Antenna radiation patterns;Couplings;Substrates;PIN photodiodes;Reflector antennas;Impedance","","115","","25","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna consists of two meandered monopoles, a feeding network using the Wilkinson power divider, two switchable 90$^{0}$-phase shifters implemented using $\lambda/4$-microstrip lines and a defected ground structure (DGS). The meandered monopoles resonating at about 1.55 GHz are placed perpendicular to each other. The input signal is divided into two signals with equal amplitude and phase by the power divider and fed to the meandered monopoles via the phase shifters. The two signals arriving at the two monopoles have a phase difference of 90$^{0}$,  $-90^{0}$ or 0$^{0}$, depending on the phase shifters controlled using six PIN-diode switches, hence generating a right/left-handed circularly polarized (CP) or linearly polarized (LP) signal. We propose a novel biasing technique to control the six PIN diodes using five voltages. Measurement results show that the antenna in CP has an impedance bandwidth $({\rm S}11 < -10 ~{\rm dB})$ of 1.06-1.64 GHz and an axial-ratio bandwidth $({\rm axial-ratio}< 3~{\rm dB})$ of 1.43-1.84 GHz, and in LP has an impedance bandwidth of 1.63-1.88 GHz.

Furthermore, the phase retrieval works independently of the transmitter/receiver position. Consequently, conventional approaches to reduce the number of monostatic acquisition points can be employed. Thus, the proposed strategy is suitable to implement either arrays that benefit from a reduced number of low-complexity elements or raster scan systems that benefit not only from the cost reduction of the scanning components but also from a remarkable speed-up due to the reduced number of acquisition points.

This technique of passive multiplexing simplifies the microwave reception chains for radar and beamforming systems (whose complexity and cost highly increase with the number of antennas) and does not require any active elements to achieve beamsteering. The preservation of the waveforms is ensured using orthogonal codes supplied by the propagation through the component's uncorrelated channels. Here we show a multiplexing technique in the physical layer that, besides being compact and passive, is compatible with all ultrawideband antennas, enabling its implementation in various fields.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2382647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985614","Beamforming;inverse problem;microwave imaging;passive technique;radar;ultrawideband (UWB)","Noise;Arrays;Array signal processing;Correlation;Multiplexing;Microwave imaging","","32","","28","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Another novelty stems from the use of rigorous synthesis techniques that enable efficiently selecting the cutoff frequencies, reflectivity level, and skirt selectivity for an arbitrary order of the absorption response. Significantly, here we investigate for the first time the out-of-band characteristics of flat absorbers and demonstrate designs which, at frequencies lower than the absorption band, present high reflectivity with a flat reflection phase.

The principle of SDIM is to invert the impedance matrix by blocks reducing significantly the complexity in comparison to a direct LU inversion of the whole impedance matrix.

Existing channel models have included the free space path loss and the molecular absorption loss, which is significant in the THz band. This paper theoretically analyzes scattering including multiple scattering referring to a sequence of scattering events from small particles, such as aerosols. Both the frequency and the impulse responses are derived. It is shown that the small particle scattering can result into significant additional loss that needs to be taken into account with the loss depending on the density and size distribution of the particles.

On the other hand, in eigen-mode expansion method (EEM), the currents are expanded versus the frequency-dependent eigen-modes of the structure, which can be obtained by solving the homogeneous differential equation governing the structure under consideration. In this paper, the theory of characteristic modes as a generalized eigen-mode expansion approach is efficiently employed for the analysis and design of the chipless RFID tags. Three important parameters usually considered in the design of multibit tags are the quality factors, resonant frequencies of the resonators (as a signature of the tag) and the radar cross-section (RCS) of the tag. A slotted-wavelength resonator is considered as a tag prototype in this paper. After a short theoretical description of SEM and CMT, the resonant and radiation modes of the tag are accurately investigated versus some design parameters.

The approach uses a lumped capacitor in the middle of a slotted patch antenna, which results in two resonant frequencies. The two resonant frequencies and their ratio are functions of the capacitance value. If a varactor with an appropriate biasing network is used, electronic tuning is realized by changing the applied DC voltage. To understand the dual-resonance behavior of the proposed antenna, an equivalent circuit model based on the transmission line theory of the antenna is established, considering the slot effect and the lumped capacitor.

This enables us to take full advantages of high order interpolation and Gaussian quadrature methods to achieve highly accurate Fourier integration results with a low sampling density. The 3D nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) helps to keep the complexity of the proposed algorithm to that similar to the traditional 3D FFT algorithm.

With the capacitance provided by the grounded strip and the radiating patch as well as the inductance introduced by the shorting pins, the resonant length of the loaded radiating patch is significantly reduced by 74% compared to that of the unloaded one. The antenna prototype with a patch size of 0.087λ0 ×0.192λ0 exhibits a measured impedance bandwidth of 1.6% centered at 2.62 GHz, a maximum realized gain of 3.9 dBi, and symmetric radiation patterns with the broadside cross-polarization levels of -20 dB in H-plane and -17.5 dB in E-plane.

Effects of ring radii, number of elements, beam switching and multi-ring operation are analyzed using array theory. Gain enhancement at the large flare angle is obtained by using grating lobes of the array factor with conical pattern elements. The switching technology is employed to improve pattern ripple in azimuthal plane and to exploit the grating lobes for achieving high gain. Excitations of all the elements are in phase. A prototype of a single-ring array with 13 elements has been fabricated and measured. Three sub-arrays each composed of four elements are arranged on the ring and the other single element is located at the center.

Initially, a printed UWB circular monopole having an asymmetric curve shaped CPW feed is designed as a base antenna for obtaining a directional radiation pattern, direction of which remains fairly same for the entire UWB. This base antenna is attached to similar antennas, in a four element cross-configuration to achieve multidirectional pattern diversity characteristics. The proposed structure provides high inter-element isolation of more than 20 dB, with an impedance bandwidth of 19.7 GHz, i.e., 1.3 GHz to 20 GHz.

In order to enhance the gain, the DIRA array is made double-sided, i.e., a mirror image of the array is placed on the other side of the DIIG. The Taylor distribution technique is employed here to suppress the sidelobes.

The sampled fields in the planar aperture have to comply the Nyquist theorem. The method takes into account the amplitude of the unit cell radiation pattern, which allows to compute more accurately the copolar and crosspolar components of the far field. Due to the generality of the NUFFT, it also allows to overcome some limitations of the FFT when computing the radiated fields of reflectarrays with periodicity larger than half a wavelength. Because the NUFFT is precision-dependent, a discussion of how its accuracy can affect the computed radiated fields is carried out. Numerical examples are provided to show the accuracy and performance of the NUFFT with regard to the FFT and direct evaluation of the fields. Finally, a study of computing times comparing the FFT, NUFFT and direct evaluation is presented.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2384033","European Space Agency; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain; Gobierno del Principado de Asturias(grant numbers:BP12-063); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6991536","Aperiodic arrays;far field;non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT);spectrum functions","Antenna radiation patterns;Apertures;Accuracy;Time complexity;Gain;Fast Fourier transforms","","18","","10","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method includes the components known as the direct, ideal reflected, lateral, and trapped surface waves. Previous literature, studying less complex geometries, is extensively reviewed and found to be incomplete and inaccurate in a number of places. These deficiencies are highlighted and the methodology is presented with enough detail to allow repetition of the results. Results are shown which approximate the scenario of a leaking water-pipe, buried in the shallow sub-surface. It is shown that the trapped surface wave does not dominate in this scenario. Furthermore, it is shown that the trapped surface wave magnitude is reduced when conductivity of the fourth layer is reduced, or when the third layer thickness is increased; these results fit the qualitative expectation based on previous results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2384035","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/F065965/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6991576","Dielectric waveguides;dipole antennas;electromagnetic propagation in absorbing media;surface waves","Surface waves;Geometry;Mathematical model;Electromagnetic fields;Equations;Media;Integral equations","","14","","14","CCBY","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
