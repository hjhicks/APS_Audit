Energy is coupled out of the cavity by a 3 × 3 slot array etched on the top surface of the cavity. Two antennas with different polarizations are designed and tested.

A driven element, engineered as an inverted-F antenna, operates at the lowest frequency of 27 MHz, while two parasitic elements, built as inverted-L monopoles, enable resonances at 49 and 53 MHz. The standalone antenna height over a ground plane is λ/25 at the lowest band. When mounted on a vehicle and bent to follow its profile, TIFA maintains similar performance with only λ/44 height above the vehicle's roof. To eliminate the need for external matching network, the driven element is offset fed. The VSWR ≤ 2 : 1 bandwidth of the first band is greater than 1%, whereas the bandwidths of the two VHF bands are narrower and do not exceed 0.4%. To mitigate possible detuning and enable full utilization of the FCC approved bandwidths, a simple approach for tuning the resonance is outlined. Scaled models of TIFA and vehicle are built and impedance and pattern measurements are conducted.

The design procedure involves three stages. In the first step, a conventional square-ring antenna is loaded with an open gap at specific locations along the square ring. This antenna exhibits two resonance characteristics (f1 and f2) with polarizations orthogonal to each other. This antenna works as a dual-band dual-linear polarized antenna. In the second step, the second resonant frequency (f2) is controlled without varying the first resonant frequency (f1) by embedding a lumped-chip capacitor/inductor in the open gap of the square-ring antenna. Therefore, the antenna has a tunable frequency ratio (f2/f1). By choosing a suitable lumped element, two proximal resonant frequencies are obtained, and two orthogonal resonant modes with a 90° phase difference are excited. Finally, pure CP is obtained. In the last stage, a lumped element is realized using a distributed element. Numerous prototypes of the proposed antenna are implemented, and their performance is measured. The measurement results show that radiation patterns with good CP characteristics are obtained at the resonant frequencies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2477093","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2013R1A1A2A10061245); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244215","circular polarization;square-ring antenna;Circular polarization (CP);square-ring antenna","Resonant frequency;Electric fields;Loaded antennas;Antenna measurements;Impedance;Capacitors","","16","","27","IEEE","7 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They employ a metal strip grating (MSG) in order to introduce the required phase constant (β) on a curved aperture to compensate for the defocusing due to the curvature. The required β is obtained by modulating the distance between adjacent strips/slots to scan the beam toward broadside. Using backward waves with a modulated MSG on a smoothly curved CLWA is a novel design. Using a backward wave allows for a doubling of the aperture size as compared to the forward-wave case. This, in turn, leads to a doubling of the directivity. A simple two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier-series model is used to explain the radiation physics. Full-wave analyses using the FEKO and HFSS software packages are carried out to design and analyze these CLWAs in 2-D and three-dimensional (3-D), and to verify the concept. A CLWA with a focused backward wave, supported by a modulated MSG, is fabricated and tested. The calculations and experimental results confirm that directive beaming is possible with a backward wave on a curved, modulated MSG.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2478913","National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); Consortium de Recherche et d’Innovation en Aerospatiale au Quebec (CRIAQ); Bombardier Aerospace Inc.; MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7268842","Conformal antennas;leaky-wave antennas;periodic structures;Broadside;conformal antennas;leaky-wave antennas;periodic structures;stopband","Strips;Apertures;Surface waves;Antenna radiation patterns;Harmonic analysis;Modulation","","27","","19","IEEE","15 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two pairs of long dipoles and two pairs of short dipoles are printed on an oriental crown-shaped substrate. Through a rational design of positions of dipoles, stable radiation patterns are achieved at the horizontal plane within a relative bandwidth of 45%. Because of the symmetry of the antenna, its differential port-to-port isolation is theoretically infinite. The antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured. The measurement results are in good agreement with the simulated ones in terms of gain, radiation patterns, and voltage standing wave ratio. Wideband impedance matching and stable radiation patterns are achieved by the proposed antenna. In particular, the half power beamwidth (HPBW) at the horizontal plane maintains a mean value 65° with only 4° variations across the desired band, which is suitable for the requirement of a three-sector base-station antenna.

In this range, the absorption efficiency of both the dipole and meander line changed little; however, the conductivity significantly impacts on radiation efficiency and the absorption cross section of the antennas. The extinction cross section of the dipole and meander line antennas (antennas that Thevenin equivalent circuit is applicable) also vary with radiation efficiency. From the point of radiation efficiency, the dipole antenna performance is most robust under decreasing conductivity. Antennas studied in this study were fabricated with brass and graphite.

Solutions are proposed to adjust the resonant frequency and balance the contributions of the magnetic and electric dipoles. The direction of the radiation pattern can be electrically switched frontward or backward by modifying the in-quadrature probes.

In practice, however, the actual sensor gain and phase are often perturbed from their nominal values, which disrupts the existing DOA estimation algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the self-calibration problem for perturbed nested arrays, proposing corresponding robust algorithms to estimate both the model errors and the DOAs. The partial Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix is employed to estimate the gain errors, and the sparse total least squares (STLS) is used to deal with the phase error issue.

The transmission and reflection properties of such a sheet are computed for normal and oblique incidences and for orthogonal polarizations of the incident electric field.

The 10-dB transient energy pattern beamwidth in the E-plane is improved from 130° to 50° using the eight-element array versus single element. Also, the signal correlation and fidelity for off-broadside angles is greatly reduced. The reflection data from a multilayer of canola oil on metal-backed marble is processed with a calibrated layer-stripping technique for material properties. The transient radiation patterns of the array are compared to that of two horn antennas with similar dimensions. The noise/interference and measurement error is shown to be greatly reduced using an array compared to horn antennas in a realistic tank environment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2473692","Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (AITF); Titan Logix under the NSERC-AITF Industrial Research Chair Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226807","Antenna;array;liquid level;material property;pulsed radar;relative permittivity;ultra-wide band (UWB);Vivaldi;Antenna;array;liquid level;material property;pulsed radar;relative permittivity;ultra-wide band (UWB);Vivaldi","Arrays;Antenna measurements;Antenna arrays;Reflection;Transient analysis;Transmission line measurements;Radar antennas","","9","","29","IEEE","27 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To that end, different clutter removal techniques are modified for multistatic frequency-based imaging. It is shown that some deficiencies of those methods in time domain, such as time overlapping, can be alleviated when they are modified for use in frequency domain. Based on the explored performance of different methods in the frequency domain, a hybrid technique, which combines the benefits of average subtraction and entropy-based filtering methods, is proposed. In this method, the average value of the multistatic scattered signals is subtracted from them at each frequency sample to remove late-stage clutters, whereas an entropy-based method is applied to mitigate early-stage strong clutters. The proposed technique is verified in realistic environments using simulations and experiments. The utilized system for verification is 1.1-3.2 GHz frequency-domain multistatic with an eight-element antenna array, and compact microwave transceiver. The simulations are performed on MRI-derived head model, whereas the experiments are done on realistic artificial head phantom. The obtained results from different locations and sizes of emulated brain injuries confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in producing high quality images of the head after mitigating the clutter.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2479238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7270292","Brain imaging;clutter rejection;microwave imaging;multi-static radar imaging;Brain imaging;clutter rejection;microwave imaging;multistatic radar imaging","Clutter;Head;Antennas;Reflection;Microwave imaging;Filtering","","41","","23","IEEE","16 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that in order to achieve one such relationship for the MP EFIE, the first- and zeroth-order LCN methods must be, respectively, used for the discretization of the VP and scalar-potential terms of the MP EFIE. The resulting numerical scheme is a point-based RWG MoM discretization of the MP EFIE via the Nyström method. Due to the MP formulation of the EFIE, the proposed method establishes notably higher accuracy compared to either RWG MoM or LCN discretizations of the EFIE in the VP form. The increased accuracy is attributed to the analytical cancellation of the line charge contributions in the MP formulation as opposed to numerical cancellation inherent in the VP formulation of the EFIE.

To describe the phenomena of sea spikes as well as the “super events” from realistic sea clutter, wedges are posited on the two-scale sea surface to provide an approximate simulation of the breaking waves. The scattering of the wedge and multiple reflections that occur from the sea and wedges are considered in ray tracing for a large HH/VV ratio. With this technique, we obtained the time sequence of the time-varying sea surface and identified the spiking events in the background. Sea clutter properties with breaking waves are compared with that of the sea. Results indicate that spiking events are more likely to occur in the sea with breaking waves. The probability distribution function (PDF) curve of the sea surface with breaking waves has a heavy trail in the large amplitude region. The decorrelation time of the sea with breaking waves is significantly longer compared with the sea without breaking waves, particularly, for HH polarization. The spike properties of sea clutter in different wind speeds and resolutions are also investigated. Results show that spike events are more likely to happen under a high sea state and radar resolution. The Doppler spectrum of the sea with breaking waves showed remarkable improvement for both polarizations.

In multiple resonant-based scatterers where the complex natural resonances (CNRs) are used as the ID of the target, the early-time response of the second scatterer might overlap with the late-time of the first, introducing some difficulties in the detection of the second scatterer and additionally, identification of the first one. In such circumstances, the separation of the late-time CNRs (ID of the scatterer) from the early-time poles (scattering centers) is challenging. The smaller the distance between two scatterers, the more difficult the detection process is. Here, by sliding a window along the time axis and applying short-time matrix pencil method (STMPM), the poles corresponding to the early-time and late-time responses are distinguished. It will be shown that when the early-time response is located at the center of the sliding window, its CNRs are located on the imaginary axis of the pole diagram. By monitoring the zero-crossing points in time damping-factor diagram, the locations of the early-time responses (or equivalently scattering centers) can be detected. Some scenarios are discussed, simulated, and confirmed by measurement results to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in practical applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2477096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244223","Chipless RFID;transient response;short-time matrix pencil method (STMPM);scattering;time-frequency analysis;singularity expansion method (SEM);Chipless RFID;scattering;short-time matrix pencil method (STMPM);singularity expansion method (SEM);time-frequency analysis;transient response","Damping;Scattering;Time-domain analysis;Image reconstruction;Time-frequency analysis;Antennas;Fourier series","","27","","17","IEEE","7 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this approach, the electric and magnetic current densities on the rough surface are analytically obtained through the current-based Kirchhoff approximation (KA), whereas the electric current density on the buried object is rigorously determined by solving the electric field integral equation (EFIE) using the Galerkin's method of moments (MoM) with Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions. The KA-EFIE matrix system is then efficiently solved by the iterative propagation-inside-layer-expansion (PILE) method combined with the algebraic adaptive cross approximation (ACA). The current densities on the dielectric rough surface are thereafter used to handle the bistatic normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) patterns. The proposed hybrid approach allows a significant reduction in computation time and memory requirements compared to the rigorous Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu (PMCHW)-EFIE formulation which requires solving a large MoM matrix equation. Moreover, the hybridization of the ACA algorithm with the PILE method improves further the computational cost thanks to the rank-deficient propriety of the coupling matrices.

The proposed method delivers a beamforming performance close to that of a phased array, without having any constraints on the antenna spacing. In the proposed structure, the RF front-end is connected to each antenna via a tunable load, whereas all antenna elements are also terminated by other tunable reactive loads. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme provides better interference suppression and achieves more average capacity compared to ESPAR technique.

This distortion causes performance degradation of the direction of arrival (DOA) algorithms. For estimating and compensating for the phase distortion, an analysis of the receiving voltages of the receiving antenna array on the platform is required. In this paper, we propose a hybrid UTD-ACGF technique for modeling port voltages of the receiving antenna array on a complex environment. The complex environment is modeled by UTD technique, and the antenna array is modeled by ACGF. In order to explain the coupling effect between the complex environment and the antenna array, we use the first perturbation series approximation based on the exact mutual coupling perturbation series. The hybrid UTD-ACGF results are verified through comparison to MoM results. Finally, we statistically define a distortion matrix that has a relation between the distorted port voltages and the ideal port voltages. The distorted port voltages are evaluated using the hybrid UTD-ACGF technique as a backbone. In order to enhance the performance of the DOA algorithm, we efficiently estimate and compensate for the distortion matrix.

However, the transmission distance of MI techniques is limited since magnetic field attenuates very fast in the near field. To this end, this paper proposes metamaterial-enhanced magnetic induction (M2I) communication mechanism, where an MI coil antenna is enclosed by a metamaterial shell that can enhance the magnetic fields around the MI transceivers. As a result, the M2I communication system can achieve tens of meters communication range by using pocket-sized antennas. In this paper, an analytical channel model is developed to explore the fundamentals of the M2I mechanism, in the aspects of communication range and channel capacity, and the susceptibility to various hostile and complex environments. The theoretical model is validated through the finite element simulation software, Comsol Multiphysics.

The unit cell comprises three thin metallic layers with air gap in between, without use of any dielectric substrate. Each metallic layer has a square wide slot within which there are a number of parallel stubs. The wide slot has a high-pass response with notch at zero frequency. Addition of the stubs creates an extra controllable notch within the wide slot high-pass response. Due to the large spacing between the two notches, a passband with low-slope phase shift response is created which leads to a wideband transmitarray. The linear polarization behavior of the antenna along with a suitable feed horn and with no dielectric loss present has resulted in higher antenna efficiency.

Subsequently, it is demonstrated that the electromagnetic wave propagation through the EBG-loaded PPW is equivalent to the propagation through a multilayered medium where each layer is characterized by a different AF. When these AFs are engineered so that their nonzero values spectrally overlap, a cumulative broadband attenuation effect can be obtained.

In contrast to previous works, the design goal is to have a multibeam antenna with arbitrary low sidelobes and at the same time a high crossing level between adjacent radiated beams. These two constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously for any passive and lossless multibeam antenna systems with a single radiating aperture due to beam orthogonality. Here, this limitation is overcome using the “split aperture decoupling” method which consists in using two radiating apertures. Each aperture is associated with a pillbox quasi-optical system with several integrated feed horns in its focal plane so as to steer the main beam in the azimuthal plane. The antenna operates at 24.15 GHz and presents very good scanning performance over an angular sector of ±40°, with a good agreement between full-wave simulations and measurements. The crossover level between adjacent beams is about -3 dB with a sidelobe level lower than -24 dB for the central beam and better than -11 dB for the extreme beam positions.

The radiated waveforms in the time domain of typical sinuous antennas contain a long ringing tail after the chirp-like main pulse when excited by a temporally short pulse. The ringing is due to resonances that are set up on the antenna arms and are essentially eliminated by modifying the shape of the arms. The first modification removes the sharp ends where the arms terminate, and the second changes the shape of the arms where they bend. These modifications are also shown to improve the gain flatness of the antennas. Three representative sinuous antennas are fabricated, tested, and demonstrated in a monostatic radar experiment. The measured results clearly show the advantages of the improved antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2477492","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2013M1A3A3A02042444); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7254172","Sinuous antenna;log periodic antennas;broadband antennas;radar measurements;Broadband antennas;log periodic antennas;radar measurements;sinuous antenna","Method of moments;Gain;Radar antennas;Ultra wideband antennas;Antenna measurements;Dipole antennas","","26","","13","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using 12 varactors with two independent voltages, reconfigurability is achieved in a fractional bandwidth of around 40% while allowing selection between circular polarization (CP) with both rotating senses and linear polarization (LP). The design is optimized based on an analytical model, which significantly speeds up the process while yielding reasonably accurate predictions. For illustration of the concept, an antenna is designed, optimized, and manufactured for reconfigurable operation in the 2.4-3.6 GHz frequency range. A good agreement between simulations and measurements is obtained which validates the proposed method. A full reconfigurability is demonstrated in the operation band with the ability to both tune the antenna to a given frequency and select a polarization state among left-hand or right-hand CP or various states of LP.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2477846","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:FT100100585); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7254158","Microstrip antennas;periodic structures;reconfigurable antennas;polarization agility;Microstrip antennas;periodic structures;polarization agility;reconfigurable antennas","Tuning;Resonant frequency;Varactors;Microstrip antennas;Antenna measurements;Microstrip","","136","","30","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
