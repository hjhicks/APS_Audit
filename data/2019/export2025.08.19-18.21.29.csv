"Circular Polarization and Reconfigurability of Fabry–Pérot Resonator Antenna Through Metamaterial-Loaded Cavity","F. Wu; K. M. Luk","City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, HK; City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, HK",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"9 Apr 2019","2019","67","4","2196","2208","In this paper, a Fabry–Pérot resonator antenna (FPRA) with a metamaterial-loaded cavity is presented. The proposed antenna preserves the simplicity from single resonant cavity and linearly polarized (LP) feed. A 3-D-printed all-dielectric metamaterial structure with hybrid locally periodic patterns is placed between the superstrate and the ground plane. The loaded metamaterial provides a new configuration for achieving self-generated circular polarization (CP) for the FPRA. Owing to the fact that the generation of CP relies solely on the anisotropy of the metamaterial, independent control of the axial ratio (AR) and directivity becomes possible, thus avoiding potential tradeoffs to be made between the AR bandwidth and the directivity increment. In addition, further polarization agility between CP and LP states can be obtained by employing different angular rotations of the metamaterial with respect to the feed antenna. The proposed concept is verified through a design example carried out at around 10 GHz showing an overlapped impedance and AR bandwidth of 6.7% (from 9.6 to 10.27 GHz). The design considerations are given with the help of performing the ray-tracing analysis. The agreement between the measurement and full-wave simulation justifies the validity.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2893213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8621019","Circularly polarized (CP) antenna;partially reflective surface (PRS);polarization reconfigurable antenna;resonant cavity antenna;wideband Fabry–Pérot antenna","Metamaterials;Cavity resonators;Dielectrics;Antenna feeds;Reflector antennas;Reflection","","32","","33","IEEE","22 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When constrained in size, the antennas are electrically small and very inefficient. This has motivated the need for novel approaches to LF antenna design. Here, we present concepts for antennas that generate electromagnetic signals from mechanical motion. We first review the generated fields and efficiency of conventional magnetic and electric dipole transmitters. This is then extended to their mechanical counterparts for comparison. Our results show that the motion of magnets or electrets (the electrical analog of a magnet) can efficiently radiate electromagnetic energy when coupled to a low-loss electromechanical suspension. Mechanical antennas, with spatial dimensions on the order of a meter, can theoretically exceed the performance of conventional short dipole and coil transmitters by more than eight orders of magnitude for frequencies of 1 kHz and below. This paper is intended to lay the foundation for future development involving the implementation of efficient, small form-factor, mechanically actuated antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2893329","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:N66001-15-C-4029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8620332","Antenna theory;electromagnetic propagation;low frequency (LF);mechanical antennas;transmitting antennas","Dipole antennas;Transmitting antennas;Electrets;Impedance;Resonant frequency","","119","","30","IEEE","20 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The vias are vertically added to the DRA elements, at appropriate positions. By means of the interaction with the electromagnetic fields, the vias can potentially affect the filed distributions and further reduce the coupled fields effectively. The isolation between the MIMO DRA elements can, therefore, be enhanced substantially. As the vias are placed inside the DRA elements, no extra footprint is needed, making the entire antenna system very simple and compact. Two typical examples, including an H-plane and an E-plane, coupled  $1\times2$  MIMO DRA arrays, have been designed, fabricated, and measured to demonstrate the feasibility and universality of this method. The results show that by using the vias appropriately, the isolation of the H-plane coupled MIMO DRA array can be enhanced from ~15.2 to 34.2 dB, while that of the E-plane array can be improved from ~13.1 to 43 dB at 26 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2891456","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871187); Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2016A030306007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8605354","Decoupling;dielectric resonator antenna (DRA);millimeter-wave (mm-wave) antenna;multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna","MIMO communication;Antenna radiation patterns;Microstrip antennas;Mutual coupling;Microstrip;Dielectric resonator antennas","","145","","27","IEEE","8 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to maintain approximately uniform effective signal strength on the surface of the earth, the radiation pattern of the antenna should be formed according to the shape of the earth. Former antennas for earth coverage purpose are either bulky or hard to realize the desired beam pattern within a wide angle range, making them unsuitable for small satellite applications. To solve this problem, this paper presents a novel circularly polarized earth coverage antenna for spaceborne applications. The proposed antenna consists of a specially designed dielectric cylinder, in which a cavity backed patch antenna is embedded. With the help of the concave structure at the top of the dielectric cylinder, the refraction of electromagnetic wave can be controlled, and then the radiation pattern is shaped. A sequentially feeding network is designed to drive the antenna. To verify our concept, a prototype is fabricated and experiments are carried out. The simulation agrees well with the measurement. The earth coverage radiation pattern is obtained within the beamwidth of θ in the range of ±50° with the measured space axial ratio is better than 3 dB from 4.9 to 5.2 GHz.

The main advantage of this method is the possibility to design a channel with subwavelength electrical size and obtain similar matching condition when compared with a conventional  $\lambda $ /4-transformer. The bandwidth of the structure is directly related to the bandwidth of the ENZ metamaterials. The suggested matching circuit is comprised of a metallic wall and an ENZ narrow channel. To realize the ENZ channel, a rectangular waveguide which operates in TE10 mode is designed and implemented using a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology. A set of vias are also needed for emulating the metallic wall to reduce the ENZ channel cross section. The proposed structure for different impedance values of 50, 100, and  $150~\Omega $  was designed, simulated, fabricated, and tested. Moreover, as an important application of a matching network, a microstrip patch antenna has been matched over the desired frequency band.

The double-element antenna covers a wide frequency range that is exploited for the realization of the tunable operation modes. This is achieved by the integration of a pair of bandpass-to-bandstop filters, each of which can be reconfigured using two varactor diodes and one p-i-n diode. The p-i-n diode serves the function of switching between bandpass and bandstop states, and the varactors facilitate the frequency tunability for both states of operation. The bandpass filter provides a continuous frequency tuning function with a minimum rolloff rate of 57 dB/GHz and out-of-band transmission coefficient <;-12 dB. The bandstop filter provides a continuous tuning function with in-band zero <;-13 dB and out-of-band pole >-1 dB. Importantly, the reconfigurable filtering functionality of the two-element antenna is preserved when fed by a wideband hybrid coupler to produce both the sum and difference radiation patterns. To obtain a high beam symmetry, the antenna elements are fed by the difference (Δ) signal to produce the directive radiation pattern and they are fed by the sum (Σ) port to produce the null in the main radiation direction. The experimental results validate this concept with a measured tunability of 50.0% for the bandpass state and 50.4% for the bandstop state.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2891451","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP160103039); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8605376","Bandpass-to-bandstop;double-element quasi-Yagi–Uda antenna;reconfigurable antennas;sum and difference patterns","Antenna radiation patterns;Broadband antennas;Directive antennas;Yagi-Uda antennas;Wideband;Tuning","","41","","46","IEEE","8 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the direct coupling among TSA elements is nonnegligible and harmful. In this paper, we show that the EBG structure is effective in reducing the direct coupling with its stopband, which prevents an electromagnetic wave from propagating in a specific frequency band. Our EBG-TSA reduces its direct coupling by 3 dB or more in a wide band. We also find that the tapered EBG structure area assists the radiation by guiding the fin current flow two-dimensionally along the tapered slot so that the boresight gain increases.

In our approach, the ENZ response is achieved by using the substrate-integrated waveguide at its cutoff frequency, with two open ends for radiation. Interestingly, this transverse cutoff mode decouples the operating frequency and the spacing distance between the radiating apertures, such that the radiation pattern can readily be adjusted by stretching or even bending the structure without changing the operating frequency. The prototypes with straight and planar-curved styles are designed and experimentally tested, both working on transverse cutoff mode at 3.5 GHz while offering the difference pattern and the broadside fan-shape pattern, respectively. The measured radiation patterns are in a good agreement with the simulation, with the peak total efficiencies higher than 63%.

The proposed reflector configuration maximizes the number of simultaneously active array elements of the phased-array feed and minimizes the required total number of array elements for this wide scan range. To realize an aperture efficiency of at least 80% at 30 GHz, our concept allows half of the antenna elements in the array to be active during scanning for a scan range of ±10° and at least a quarter of the array elements to be active for a scan range of ±20°. This is a major improvement as compared to the scanning capabilities of focal-plane arrays based on conventional single- and double-parabolic reflector configurations. In addition, the FPA configuration has been optimized for wideband optical true-time-delay beamforming which requires a linear phase distribution along the array elements.

Low-loss matching networks are inserted in each channel between the antenna and amplifiers in order to optimize power transfer in transmission and/or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in reception. The adjustment of these matching components becomes challenging if residual coupling between antenna elements significantly influences the results. The most general, so-called, array noise matching then leads to the optimum SNR taking into account the noise-coupling effects also. This paper describes that concept completely in the scattering matrix domain using waves for signal and noise rather than voltages and currents.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2893229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8616824","Amplifier noise;antenna array mutual coupling;arrays impedance matching;multiport circuits;noise;nonreciprocal circuits;signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)","Signal to noise ratio;Antenna arrays;Receiving antennas;Magnetic resonance imaging;Scattering;Couplings","","3","","31","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The generation, as well as the steering of the quadratic phase distribution, is difficult for a series-fed NFF array antenna, especially for a large-aperture application. This is because the phase control capability of the planar series-fed beam-forming network is limited. In this paper, a curved substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) is employed as the feeding carrier to enhance the amplitude and phase control capability. The spatial placement of the SIW slot array antenna can be sufficiently used to synthesize the desired NFF beam. As examples, two kinds of proactive conformal SIW NFF slot array antennas, working in the standing-wave mode and the leaky-wave mode, have been developed. Both of them have the ability to generate the high-quality NFF beam. In addition, the proactive conformal SIW leaky-wave slot array antenna has the stable focal height over a wide steerable range. After careful analysis and design, these two kinds of antenna arrays are fabricated and proactively conformal to 3-D-printed frameworks with the desired shape. The theoretical analysis and simulated results are verified by experimental results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2891725","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631012,61721001); National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8606994","Curved substrate integrated waveguide (SIW);near-field focused (NFF);NFF beam steering;NFF SIW slot array antenna;proactive conformal","Phased arrays;Slot antennas;Shape;Substrates;Phase control","","56","","54","IEEE","10 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The LSs are the series involving Hankel functions of arbitrary order, which are not convergent for complex wavenumbers. It is shown that by extending Ewald representations to higher order Hankel functions, the LSs can be expressed in terms of spatial and spectral series, granting Gaussian convergence even in the case of complex and leaky waves. The method allows for the appropriate choice of the spectral determination for each space harmonic of a given LS coefficient, thus permitting one to obtain modal solutions that may correspond to physical and nonphysical leaky-wave phenomena. First, the proposed LS calculation is exploited in the evaluation of the free-space 1-D periodic Green's function for 2-D structures. Then, the same procedure for the LSs is implemented in a cylindrical harmonic expansion method, based on the transition-matrix and the generalized reflection-matrix approach, for the full-wave analysis of leaky modes in 2-D electromagnetic band-gap waveguides formed by layered arrays of cylindrical inclusions.

The results have allowed us to demonstrate in the terahertz band that perfect absorption with excellent electrical tunability can be achieved within a wide span of mobility values (from 200 to 20000 cm2V-1s-1) which almost covers the whole range of ever reported room-temperature mobilities.

Our work provides systematic and instructive insights into the design of highly tunable absorbers, without restrictions on graphene mobility.

The electromagnetic compatibility requirements for airports are becoming more and more complex, so rather than using traditional ray-tracing (RT) simulation models, a more accurate approach such as the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) is needed. The application of FDTD to ILS signal modeling suffers from an intensively high computation burden. The computation burden is owing to: 1) the FDTD has to loop a large number of time steps and 2) for every step, a huge number of cells has to be updated. This paper solves the above-mentioned issues by twofold. First, this model allows a large Courant–Friedrich–Levy number for the FDTD to reduce the total time step. This is achieved by combining the locally one-dimension (LOD) FDTD and the complex-envelope (CE) technique. The combination of CE, LOD, and FDTD (CE-LOD-FDTD) makes the model update with larger time step and retain the same level of accuracy.

The integral equation is of the second kind and has no spurious resonances. It is well conditioned at all frequencies for simply connected geometries. Reconstruction of the magnetic field, however, is subject to catastrophic cancelation due to the need for computing a scalar potential from magnetic currents. Here, we show that by solving an auxiliary (scalar) integral equation, we can avoid this form of low-frequency breakdown. The auxiliary scalar equation is used to solve a Neumann-type boundary value problem using data corresponding to the normal component of the magnetic field. This scalar equation is also of the second kind, nonresonant, and well conditioned at all frequencies. A principal advantage of our approach, by contrast with the hypersingular electric field integral equation, the combined field integral equation, or CSIE formulations, is that the standard loop-star and related basis function constructions are not needed, and preconditioners are not required. This permits an easy coupling to fast algorithms such as the fast multipole method. Furthermore, the formalism is compatible with nonconformal mesh discretization and works well with singular (sharp) boundaries.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2891399","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación(grant numbers:TEC2016-78028-C3-3-P); Office of the Secretary of Defense(grant numbers:FA9550-10-1-0180); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8605366","Calderon preconditioning (CP);charge-current formulations;electromagnetic (EM) scattering;high-frequency preconditioning;Maxwell equations","Integral equations;Boundary conditions;Mathematical model;Standards;Electromagnetic scattering;Geometry;Magnetic resonance","","1","","44","IEEE","8 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose the usage of ultra-low frequencies (ULF: <3 Hz) to detect submerged objects due to the larger skin depths (1.5 km at 0.03 Hz) at those frequencies. Using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, ULF scatterings from objects submerged in the ocean are obtained. This is achieved by running the FDTD model in the scattered-field-only regime, in which EM field components in a 3-D FDTD grid are excited by a “hard” source, i.e., the electric field components are set to a sinusoid at ULF to represent the scatterings from the object. The propagation attenuation versus distance from the source (object) is recorded and compared to the propagation attenuation as predicted by the plane wave theory. A total round-trip propagation attenuation is estimated for ULF waves originating in the air region above the ocean.

On the other hand, a so-called least-squares FEM(LSFEM) is becoming increasingly popular due to its unique properties. For instance, the generated stiffness matrix is positive definite. Effort has been made to apply this node-element-based LSFEM to model EM problems, mostly in the theoretical aspect. In this paper, we will use normalized Maxwell's equations incorporated with the constitutive relations of bianisotropic media, which represents the most general cases in the linear regime. Subsequently, the corresponding variational formulation is derived, followed by the generation of matrix systems. We then implement and validate various boundary conditions. Furthermore, we apply this scheme to simulate wave scattering in the presence of bianisotropic media that are categorized into three types. A good convergence rate and agreement between the LSFEM results and the referenced solutions has been achieved, which proves the Lagrange-element-based LSFEM as a feasible alternative to the edge-element-based FEM currently used in EM modeling.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2893182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8620310","Electromagnetic metamaterials;electromagnetic propagation;finite-element analysis","Finite element analysis;Mathematical model;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Boundary conditions;Periodic structures;Magnetic anisotropy","","5","","40","IEEE","20 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To obtain the ACGF of antennas, numerical simulations such as moment method (MoM) are mainly used. However, these numerical simulations require large memory and it is time consuming to obtain a solution. The computer-aided design (CAD) model for the numerical simulation should be accurately designed. Therefore, we propose an alternative method for obtaining the ACGF based on infinitesimal dipole modeling (IDM). The IDM is a technique to model antennas with a distribution of theoretically expressed dipoles. The infinitesimal dipoles have the form of a current distribution, the same as that of the ACGF. The IDM can be optimized with the radiation pattern of the modeled antenna, which can be measured without a numerical simulation. The CAD model is not required, and only an approximate dimension of the antenna is used. A CAD model of a seven-patch array antenna with a large platform and a manufactured single Yagi antenna are used to verify the proposed scheme. For verification, we calculate the active element pattern (AEP) based on the ACGF for the antennas. These AEPs calculated, based on the ACGF obtained by MoM, are compared with those calculated on the basis of the IDM. The AEPs represent a sufficient coincident tendency and the phase values are even more accurate than the existing scheme.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2894279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624597","Active element pattern (AEP);antenna current Green’s function (ACGF);infinitesimal dipole modeling (IDM)","Solid modeling;Method of moments;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Dipole antennas;Antenna radiation patterns","","12","","29","IEEE","23 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mirror source theory predicts the arrival rate to be quadratic in delay, inversely proportional to room volume, and proportional to the product of the antenna beam coverage fractions. We approximate the mirror source positions by a homogeneous spatial Poisson point process and their gain as complex random variables with the same second moment. The multipath delays in the resulting model form an inhomogeneous Poisson point process, which enables the derivation of the characteristic functional, power-/kurtosis-delay spectra, and the distribution of order statistics of the arrival delays in closed form. We find that the proposed model matches the mirror source model well in terms of power-delay spectrum, kurtosis-delay spectrum, order statistics, and prediction of mean delay and rms delay spread.

The results from the mmWave band study are compared to an already well-studied lower frequency FCC band (3.4–10.1 GHz). During the measurements, only selective objects (emulated multipath clusters in the propagation channel) are illuminated in a small lecture room. The experiments show that for both UWB channels, the complex received (Rx) signal is a circularly symmetric non-Gaussian random variable with highly correlated inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) components. These properties demonstrate that the intracluster multipath components (MPCs) structure is sparse. Consequently, modeling the cluster fading envelope with Rayleigh–Rice distribution is not realistic. Therefore, the sum-of-cisoids principle is used for intracluster multipath modeling which inherently considers a correlation between I and Q components. It has been established that a reasonably good approximation of the cluster fading envelope can be obtained with  $N=3-6$  equal amplitude cisoids.

This paper presents a rigorous approach to incorporate surface roughness into VPE-based models. To that end, the rough surface is first parameterized using a Karhunen-Loève expansion and then embedded into the VPE.

The antenna is one of the most important components in a WCE system. In this paper, we present novel small antenna solutions for a WCE system operating at the 433 MHz ISM band along with a link budget analysis. The in-body capsule transmitter uses an ultrawideband outer wall conformal loop antenna, whereas the on-body receiver uses a printed monopole antenna with a partial ground plane. A colon-equivalent tissue phantom and CST Gustav voxel human body model were used for the numerical studies of the capsule antenna. The simulation results in the colon-tissue phantom were validated through in vitro measurements using a liquid phantom. According to the phantom simulations, the capsule antenna has −10 dB impedance matching from 309 to 1104 MHz. The ultrawideband characteristic enables the capsule antenna to tolerate the detuning effects due to electronic modules in the capsule and due to the proximity of various different tissues in gastrointestinal tracts. The same design methodology was applied to on-body antennas followed by in vitro and ex vivo measurements for validation. The on-body antenna exceeds −10 dB impedance matching from 385 to 502 MHz both in simulations and measurements. The path loss for the radio link between an in-body capsule transmitter and an on-body receiver using our antenna solutions, in simulations and measurements, is less than 50 dB for any capsule orientation and location, ensuring sufficient signal level at the receiver, hereby enabling an improved capsule endoscope.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2900389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648490","Conformal antenna;in-to-on body propagation;wireless capsule endoscope","Receiving antennas;Phantoms;Transmitting antennas;Ultra wideband antennas;Antenna measurements","","98","","62","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, it records the Radon transform (RT) of the desired field-of-view (FOV) and reconstructs the image using the Fourier slice theorem. To achieve the illumination of the FOV, the proposed imaging configuration uses a rotating linear antenna array that produces a highly directive fan beam. The antenna elements are further reduced using multistatic sparse array techniques without compromising the image reconstruction process. By dramatically reducing the number of active elements, the new method could allow high-resolution mmW/THz imaging systems to be embedded in low profile and lightweight platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles or CubeSats.

In this way, the antenna retains the high radiation efficiency with its simple excitation.

However, there is no fast and effective means to shape the subreflector during the structural optimization process. This communication is based on the application of geometrical optics (GO)/physical optics (PO) analysis to shape a subreflector for antenna distortion compensation. Thus, a method performing an iterative approximation to the GO/PO analysis is proposed. Unlike GO shaping or optimization, the proposed method is not formulated by simultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Therefore, the main contribution of this communication is that the method does not entail computationally intensive calculation and optimization, and thus, it does not require a large amount of time to complete the calculation. The proposed method is very suitable for a large reflector antenna with a small-amplitude deformation and smoothly varying errors such that the shaped subreflector does not have a significant effect on the amplitude of the main reflector’s electric field. An example with regard to the symmetric system is presented.

However, single-objective optimization fails to provide decision makers with enough choices in the tradeoff between BCEs and flat beam patterns. To overcome such a problem, the aperture amplitude distribution is approximated with the Taylor series expansion, and then a multiobjective optimization model is established. Here, the objectives are twofold. The first is to maximize the attainable BCE; and the second is to achieve a flat beam.

Stability and SNR have dominated most reports to date; little has been discussed with regard to the underlying innovative physics of non-Foster augmented radiators.

In this communication, we introduce a new technique for finding disjoint and fully covering sets of weight vectors, each of which constitutes a sparse subarray, forming a single beam. Our algorithm decomposes the original nonconvex optimization problem for finding disjoint weight vectors into a sequence of convex problems.

In order to generate HP omnidirectional radiation patterns for each unit, three wideband planar dipoles are employed as basic elements and they are connected by a wideband three-way power divider with equal magnitude and phase, conducting as a loop antenna. Based on such a configuration, the antenna unit obtains an HP omnidirectional pattern as well as a wide bandwidth of 48.2% (VSWR < 1.5 within 1.67–2.73 GHz). However, the gain variation is more than 2.5 dB, which is relatively large. To reduce the gain variation, a novel approach is proposed by dividing the six antenna units into three unit pairs. Each unit pair consists of two antenna units which are complementary in radiation pattern. Using this method, the number of basic elements in each antenna unit is not increased, but the simulated gain variation is effectively reduced to about 1.24 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2894030","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61725102,61828102); Guangdong Special Support Program(grant numbers:2018TX04X086); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China(grant numbers:201901010410020002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8626447","Dipole antenna;horizontal polarization (HP) antenna;omnidirectional antenna;wideband antenna","Dipole antennas;Antenna measurements;Gain;Omnidirectional antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Bandwidth;Broadband antennas","","52","","25","IEEE","25 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
