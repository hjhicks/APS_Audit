The antenna, feed line, and the platform are represented by a common meshed model and simulated using a single time-domain numerical method. This paper aims to establish guidelines on how to achieve high accuracy when modeling both the near and far fields of an antenna while at the same time prioritizing computational resources. By isolating critical features such as the feed line and selected fine details of the antenna geometry, this paper assesses how accurately these fine features need to be described in the model and how they affect the return loss and far-field pattern of the antenna. The size of the platform is varied from small to medium size (up to 10 wavelengths) and its impact on the antenna performance is assessed. Finally, the conclusions of the study are applied to an example of an antenna installed in the leading edge of an aircraft wing, with and without, a protective radome cover.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2884769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8558592","Aircraft antennas;broadband antennas;numerical analysis","Broadband antennas;Time-domain analysis;Computational modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Antenna radiation patterns;Aircraft","","13","","40","IEEE","4 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because of the combined role of transmit and receive arrays in this processing for monostatic MIMO radar, mutual coupling present in these arrays impacts the beamforming in a unique way. This paper presents a mathematical model of a MIMO radar with coupled antennas and appropriate radio frequency circuitry. Application of the model to evaluate radar detection of a single target demonstrates that coupling can result in target detection angles that are in error by as much as 12° and increase beamformer response sidelobe levels by as much as 8 dB. The results also show that a simple matching network can improve detection performance, particularly when array mutual coupling is high.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2888702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8581509","Beam steering;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems;mutual coupling;radar antennas","Radar antennas;Couplings;Array signal processing;Antenna arrays;MIMO radar;Receiving antennas","","23","","26","IEEE","19 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this band, due to the large wavelengths, practical antennas used for DF are electrically small and have limited bandwidths. When such a DF array is mounted on a platform, however, the platform's presence can be exploited to considerably improve the performance of the platform-based DF system compared to that of a stand-alone DF system. Our proposed approach relies upon selecting and exciting a group of the platform's CMs that provides the lowest Cramer-Rao bound for the DF system's accuracy. This approach allows for designing DF systems that can accurately detect the direction of arrival and the state of polarization of the wave over wide fields of views. This approach is used to design and simulate an HF DF system for an airborne platform. A scaled-model prototype of this platform-based DF array is fabricated and characterized. The measurement results of this array are used to perform DF experiments in an emulated environment. Measured results are found to be in good agreement with simulations, confirming the efficacy of the proposed design approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2884878","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-11-1-0618); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8565924","Characteristic mode (CM) theory;Cramer–Rao bounds (CRB);direction finding (DF) systems;direction-of-arrival estimation;platform-based antenna","Antenna arrays;Antenna measurements;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna theory;Azimuth;Antenna accessories","","31","","35","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is mainly due to a lack of exact analytical expressions that can be used to rapidly predict the radiation properties of loaded nanoantennas. This paper will derive a set of useful analytical expressions for the far-field radiation properties of loop antennas loaded with an arbitrary number of lumped impedances that are valid from the RF-to-optical regimes. The analytical expressions will be validated with full-wave solvers and can be evaluated more than $100\times $ faster. The ability to perform such rapid evaluations enables, for the first time, large-scale single-objective and multi-objective optimizations. A series of optimizations reveal that electrically small superdirective antennas can be achieved at a variety of far-field angles through capacitive loading, paving the way for a pattern reconfigurable antenna. In addition, gains of greater than 3 dB can be achieved for electrically small antennas over a fractional bandwidth of 28%.

However, to-date, the way the CP characteristics of these antennas affect the communication link (CL) between the internal antenna (capsule antenna) and the external antenna has not been investigated in-depth. In this paper, we first show that when CP waves illuminate a human body, they effectively become depolarized as they penetrate the body. Next, we show that the performance of the CP antenna varies significantly with the location and orientation when located in-body. Following this, we carry out a series of simulations to demonstrate the fact that-contrary to the widely-held belief-a CP antenna does not provide, in ingestible applications, a more robust CL with the external antenna in comparison to either a dual-polarized or a linearly-polarized (LP) antenna. These simulations are carried out at 2.45 GHz and the results are confirmed by experiments. Given this background, we propose a simple and effective communication scheme, which is based on the use of an omnidirectional LP internal antenna and a CP external antenna, and we demonstrate that this combination provides a CL that is more robust than those realized by using the CP antennas alone.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2888819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8581513","Capsule antenna;circularly-polarized (CP);communication link (CL);dual-polarized (DP);linearly-polarized (LP);robustness","Dipole antennas;Biological system modeling;Directive antennas;Broadband antennas;Robustness;Electric fields","","19","","34","IEEE","19 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the current distribution formula in an isotropic medium, the analytical expression for the current distribution in an anisotropic plasma is derived. The current distribution under an anisotropic condition is composed of the contributions from both the ordinary and extraordinary waves, and thus has a more complicated form. Computations show that the amplitude coefficients for the ordinary wave are obviously greater than those for the extraordinary wave, and the current distribution in an anisotropic plasma is more sensitive to parameter changes. The input impedance of the antenna becomes much larger in this case because of the high refractive index of the ionosphere at the VLF range. Despite that, the impedance can still be adjusted to a small value by selecting a proper electrical length. Finally, the method proposed in this paper may help improve the efficiency of a space-borne linear antenna by determining the optimal antenna parameters.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2884808","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571389,61271086); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8558590","Anisotropic Plasma;linear antenna;very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic wave","Current distribution;Plasmas;Ionosphere;Impedance;Satellite broadcasting;Dipole antennas","","26","","24","IEEE","4 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the specific multiunit structure of MSA, the filtering method is first realized on each radiating metasurface (MS) unit by introducing a multifolded U-shaped slot and a defected ground structure to generate lower edge radiation nulls. Meanwhile, coplanar parasitic patches are loaded around the MS units to provide upper edge nulls and simultaneously introduce extra in-band resonances for wide passband. Thus, a low-profile, wideband, and high-gain filtering antenna is readily constructed. To verify the concept, a prototype with a low profile of only 0.04λ0 is designed and fabricated. The simulated and measured results agree well, demonstrating a good performance with large impedance bandwidth of about 20%, high average gain of 8 dBi, and high aperture efficiency of about 90%, together with high out-of-band suppression levels of about 20 dB. In addition, the radiation patterns are symmetric in both the Eand H-planes with cross-polarization suppressions of over 20 dB.

Although dual-polarized arrays are widely used in LTE base stations, analog beam-forming arrays have not been realized before, due to the huge challenge of achieving wide operating bandwidth and stable array patterns. To tackle these problems, for the first time, we present a novel wideband multiple beam-forming antenna array based on Butler matrices. The described beam-forming networks produce three beams but the methods are applicable to larger networks. The essential part of the beam-forming array is a wideband three-beam Butler matrix, which comprises quadrature couplers and fixed wideband phase shifters. Wideband quadrature and phase shifters are developed using striplines, which provide the required power levels and phase differences at the outputs. To achieve the correct beamwidth and to obtain the required level of crossover between adjacent beams, beam-forming networks consisting of augmented three-beam Butler matrices using power dividers are presented to expand the number of output ports from three to five or six. Dual-polarized, three-beam antenna arrays with five and six elements covering LTE band are developed. Prototypes comprising beam-forming networks and arrays are tested according to LTE base station specification.

Radiation properties are enhanced by designing novel corrugated soft-surface structures and implementing them using the low-temperature co-fired ceramic process with no extra cost and fabrication complexity. This is achieved by adjusting via land diameters of periodic grounded vias in top four layers of the package, which in fact create perfect magnetic boundaries between the phased-array antenna elements to modify the electric near-field distributions and consequently improve far-field characteristics including gain, cross polarization, sidelobe level, and beam steering. Low-loss transitions from flip-chip IC to antenna elements are designed with less than 0.1 dB amplitude and 2° phase imbalance over 50–70 GHz. Prototypes with/without soft-surface structures are fabricated to work with flip-chip ICs with/without switches. A USB-interface adapter and a waveguide-interface module with a compact vertical power combiner are proposed for the first time to experimentally evaluate the phased-array antenna while connected to the flip-chip RF IC.

To obtain the desired power gain pattern, current literatures solve the problem known as shaped beam pattern synthesis (SBPS) by setting the beam pattern expression as the cost function. The power gain in a certain direction of the array antenna is comprehensively decided by the array radiated power density and the total radiated power. Both these two parameters are affected by the selection of array elements' weights. However, the SBPS-based methods do not take the total radiated power into account. Therefore, the SBPS-based methods cannot obtain the power gain pattern directly, and the optimal power gain pattern, consequently, cannot be guaranteed. To overcome this deficiency, this paper maximizes the minimum power gain in the desired wide main lobe by directly setting the power gain expression as the cost function. Aiming at optimizing the cost function, this paper first sets up a power gain optimization problem which has concave form. Termed this optimization problem as the power gain pattern synthesis (PGPS) problem. The concave PGPS problem is then converted to a series of convex subproblems and an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve it efficiently. Solution to the PGPS problem is proven to be able to achieve higher minimum power gain in a desired wide main lobe than the results from the SBPS-based algorithms. Simulations are carried out with both linear array antenna and planar array antenna. Comparisons with the existed SBPS-based algorithms validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed PGPS-based algorithm. In addition, further improvement on suppressing the sidelobe level for the PGPS problem is discussed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2884814","Fundamental Research Funds For Central Universities of China(grant numbers:ZYGX2018J021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8558576","Adaptive beamforming;array pattern synthesis;convex optimization technique;power gain optimization;wide main lobe beam","Gain;Directive antennas;Linear antenna arrays;Optimization;Receiving antennas;Convex functions","","58","","18","IEEE","4 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna in this paper is designed by utilizing only two separate metallic layers-a corporate-feed network layer and a radiating slot layer. Compared with the conventional three-layered slot array antennas, the proposed antenna avoids the utilization of the backed cavity layer so that its complexity and manufacture cost decrease. In order to solve the problem of the narrow bandwidth caused by taking away the backed cavities, we utilize double-ridged radiating slots instead of the conventional rectangular ones.

Power to the nonvisible region corresponds to stored energy in the Poynting volume; stored energy corresponds to reactive power, which is in quadrature with the nonvisible, time-averaged power; and quadrature suggests the invocation of the Hilbert transform. The end result of the Hilbert transform process is a straightforward, closed-form analytical expression for the mutual reactance. Since the closed-form mutual resistance has been determined previously, both closed-form expressions can be combined to provide an elegant, but easy-to-use formulation for the mutual impedance. For a given current distribution, the results are exact and validated against data obtained numerically. Cases associated with the half-wave dipole, generalized dipole distribution, and the uniform distribution are provided herein as examples of the robustness of the presented theory.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2888954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8584464","Autocorrelation;convolution;Helmholtz operator;Hilbert transforms;line sources;mutual impedance;mutual reactance;Parseval’s identity;Poynting’s theorem;radiated power;stored energy","Current distribution;Antennas;Impedance;Fourier transforms;Convolution;Correlation","","2","","17","IEEE","20 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The profiles of conventional dual-polarized omnidirectional MIMO antennas are too high to be planar integrated due to the limited bandwidth of vertical-polarized element. Therefore, a dual-channel horizontal-polarized MIMO antenna is proposed for the planar integration of omnidirectional MIMO antenna. The antenna is formed with four-element folded dipole array, and a compact feed network with two sets of 90° progressive phases is employed to feed the two channels with shared elements, thus the antenna can be integrated into a sheet of substrate with an ultralow profile of 0.8 mm. Although the polarization and radiation pattern (amplitude) of the two colocated channels are the same with each other, a high isolation is still achieved as a result of the orthogonal pattern phase. A prototype was fabricated to validate the performance. The measured highest isolation between two channels is 31.7 dB, and -10 dB isolated bandwidth is 2.29-2.57 GHz (11.7%) with S11 <; -14 dB and envelope correlation coefficient less than 0.05, which shows a good diversity performance.

The novelty of the design lies in its multifunctional characteristics with independent control of the biasing states (ON/OFF) of the diodes mounted on opposite layers. This leads to four different working states (dual bandpass for OFF-OFF state, single-band absorber for OFF-ON state, single-bandpass for ON-OFF state, and reflector for ON-ON state) being facilitated by the proposed reconfigurable AFSS. Furthermore, the effects of the design parameters and active components on multifunctional responses are extensively analyzed by deriving equivalent circuit models.

For this purpose, a unitary transformation matrix is defined, which contains the transmitted and received amplitudes as basis vectors corresponding to OAM-based communication between two antenna arrays. The mixed-mode matrix is then obtained from the corresponding similarity transformation of the standard scattering matrix available, e.g., from numerical simulations or measurements. The mixed-mode matrix allows better physical insight into OAM-based communication by clearly separating all modes and is more efficient than postprocessing of single-antenna results in a system simulator. Mode conversion/isolation and proper mode termination can be easily quantified. Also, it allows generalizing the interpretation of OAM-based communication by focusing on the property of a constant phase difference within each antenna array. The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated using method of moments (MoM) simulations of dipole radiators in various arrangements of a transmitting and a receiving array. Systematic parameter studies that reveal dependencies of OAM-based communication are possible by using the mixed-mode matrix. As an application, communication patterns are studied, in order to obtain the suitable position and relative orientation in space for good mode isolation or communication.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2889033","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585088","Array antennas;method of moment (MoM);mixed-mode scattering parameter;orbital angular momentum (OAM);wireless communication","Antenna arrays;Scattering;Dipole antennas;Scattering parameters;Method of moments;Wireless communication","","32","","29","IEEE","21 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The type of channel link and position of the wearable antenna lead to significant changes in the radio link channel. Path loss (PL) computed shows the increase in magnitude for non line of sight (NLOS) in comparison to line of sight (LOS), though the variation over a distance of 5 m is more significant for LOS (10 dB) than NLOS links (4-5 dB). For total NLOS links, B-to-B channels have slightly higher PL and delay spread parameters in comparison to off-B channel. The B-to-B LOS channels have least PL (44-56 dB), rms delay spread (0.5-4 ns), and multipath components (3-20) which can be attributed to the directional radiation pattern due to the presence of the human body for both Tx and Rx nodes. For back-to-back antenna orientation of the B-to-B channel, maximum signal strength degradation and multipath are observed.

One such example of this will occur in urban environments, where wearable devices and vehicular networks will operate in close proximity to one another. Clearly, a natural extension to both types of network is their interconnectivity through vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) or equivalently pedestrian-to-vehicle (P2V) communications as part of a much greater vehicle-to-X (V2X)-based intelligent transportation system. To this end, we empirically investigate the P2V communications channel at 5.8 GHz for the case of a moving vehicle when a person positioned by the edge of a road was either stationary or walking parallel to the side of the highway. The measurements considered a chest-mounted transmitter and four receiver locations on the vehicle covering the front wing mirrors and two positions on the roof, which simultaneously recorded the received signal power. To characterize the propagation mechanisms which are responsible for shaping the received signal in the P2V channel, we decomposed it into its path loss (PL), large-scale, and small-scale fading components. We first show that although there was evidence of interference caused by multiple rays interacting with one another, the popular two-ray ground-reflection PL model was unable to adequately describe the compounded effects of the vehicle and pedestrian's body on the signal attenuation in the majority of the considered scenarios. Instead, we found that the overall PL was well characterized using a dual-slope log-distance model, with lognormal large-scale fading. Due to the often severe small-scale fading that was observed in the P2V channel, we have been able to utilize the κ-μ extreme distribution with considerable success to characterize the worse than Rayleigh fading conditions which were encountered.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2885461","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/L026074/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576610","κ-μ distribution;κ-μ extreme distribution;channel measurements;fading channels;path loss (PL);two-ray ground-reflection;vehicular communications;wearable communications","Fading channels;Wireless communication;Antennas;Antenna measurements;Roads;Receivers;Shadow mapping","","15","","50","CCBY","14 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle these difficulties, we, for the first time to our best knowledge, exploit a connection between the deep neural network (DNN) architecture and the iterative method of nonlinear EM inverse scattering. This enables the development of a novel DNN-based methodology for nonlinear EM inverse problems (termed here DeepNIS).

In this paper, a novel substrate-integrated E-plane waveguide (SIEW) is presented. In SIEW, additional copper strips are inserted at the middle layer of the structure while the copper plated through holes remain unchanged. Consequently, the vertical current flows on the through holes and the longitudinal current flows along the middle strips to meet the wave propagation requirement in the E-plane waveguide circuit. The insertion loss, cutoff frequency, and propagation constant of the SIEW are investigated. As examples, an empty SIEW, a bandpass septum SIEW filter, and a dual-polarized SIEW horn antenna are designed using the SIEW technique.

In response to these two challenges that come with the design of rectennas for ambient energy harvesting, this paper discusses a figure of merit to evaluate the rectenna performance that combines the rectification efficiency, the radiation efficiency, and the spherical coverage of the antenna. To illustrate this proposed figure of merit, a rectenna with a strengthen RF-to-dc efficiency and also a full spatial coverage is designed using beam-forming networks. The resulting system is demonstrated for a wireless sensor mounted on a pole. To maintain a reasonable size of the prototype, a miniaturization technique of a 4× 4 Butler matrix (BM) is investigated, which allows for the reduction of the footprint of the BM by 2 compared to its classical microstrip design counterpart at 2.4 GHz. The overall rectification efficiency and dc power patterns are reported for the elevation plane of one multidirectional rectenna at 2.4 GHz for an incident power density of 0.45 μW·cm-2. It is shown that the system can triple the dc output power compared to a three-dipole counterpart occupying the same area.

The difference between the algorithms is discussed first, and then the numerical stabilities are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. It is shown that the numerical stability of the dual-probe imaging algorithm is dominated by the reflection coefficients and that the contributions of transmission coefficients to numerical stability as well as the image quality are negligible. Moreover, the condition number of the proposed dual-probe reflection-coefficient-only imaging algorithm is equal to that of the single-probe algorithm exploiting the auxiliary equation. This implies that the lossless assumption imposed by the auxiliary equation can be discarded in the proposed dual-probe algorithm.

With the slot designed to be antisymmetric with respect to the bisection plane and oppositely fed by two microstrip lines, good differential-mode (DM) performance was obtained. On the other hand, the radiations contributed by the corresponding parts of the antisymmetric CP antenna will be destructive when in common-mode (CM) operation. This results in high CM suppression without a preceding CM-rejection bandpass filter. Also, low DM axial ratios (ARs) were achieved by tuning the truncated corner length, the protruded stub length, and the coupling length and gap of the C-shaped radiating patches.

The design consists of a monopolar patch and two orthogonal dipoles. The wideband performance for the monopolar patch is obtained from two nearly overlapped radiating modes controlled by an array of shorting wires. For the two orthogonal dipoles, the antenna profile is reduced with the effect of parasitic patches. One of the key design features is to utilize the shorting wire in the monopolar patch to feed the dipoles, allowing a simple design and avoiding any feeding network. The concept is experimentally verified with a prototype exhibiting an overlapped bandwidth of 14% with a low profile of 0.09λ, where λ is the free-space wavelength at the lowest operating frequency. The measured peak gain in two broadside modes and in monopolar mode are 10 and 7.5 dBi, respectively. Measured isolation between any port is better than 31 dB in the whole frequency range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2889157","Australian Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8584891","Crossed dipole antenna;low-profile antenna;monopolar antenna;omnidirectional antennas;tripolarized antenna;wideband","Dipole antennas;Broadband antennas;Wires;Substrates;Wideband","","30","","36","IEEE","21 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The FPRA is realized by sticking the adhesive copper tape on the surfaces of the groove, forming a pair of parallel plates and the ground plane. The FPRA is excited by a sleeve-integrated L-probe, which suppresses the cross-polar fields and widens the bandwidth of the FPRA. To validate the idea, a dual-frequency antenna, covering both the 2.4 and 24 GHz ISM bands, was designed and measured. The DRA operates in its TEx111 mode, whereas the FPRA operates in its fundamental mode. Next, a wideband dual-frequency antenna was designed to further cover the 4G and future 5G frequency bands.

There are two major issues with the conventional MLFMA for multiple moving targets. One is that the relative positions and attitudes of the targets change with time and we have to remesh the solution domain and refill the matrix elements at each simulation moment. The other is that we have to solve the matrix equations repeatedly for the moving targets. To alleviate these two burdens, we adopt the stationary grouping scheme in using the MLFMA for individual object, which is unchanged as the object is moving. With the grouping scheme, the near interactions are invariant, and most far interactions are reusable when the objects are in motions. The number of levels of MLFMA remains the same even if the overall dimension of the multiple targets is changing. The interactions between objects are expressed via coordinate transforms at the highest levels of their octrees. To accelerate the iterative solutions, the sparse approximate inverse preconditioner is incorporated.

The model parameters are far-field pattern values, cylindrical or spherical-wave expansion coefficients, or equivalent surface-source values. The normal matrix of this linear system of equations is sometimes extremely ill-conditioned. This occurs when certain sets of model parameters lie outside the spatial bandwidth of the operator that computes the probe output. One remedy is to restrict the sets of model parameters allowed and perform upsampling if needed to achieve the desired accuracy. These ideas are illustrated through analysis and examples that involve both 2-D and 3-D scanning geometries.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2891233","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-15-C-0010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8603822","Condition number;least-squares solution;linear system of equations;near-field scanning","Probes;Mathematical model;Transmission line matrix methods;Antenna measurements;Geometry;Linear systems;Computational modeling","","14","","25","IEEE","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
