"Investigation on Current Reduction Effects of Baluns for Measurement of a Small Antenna","T. Fukasawa; N. Yoneda; H.

This effect can be large when the antenna and ground plane are small and asymmetric. A balun is proposed for use in antenna measurement to reduce the influence of measurement cables. Baluns were originally utilized for a transformer set between unbalanced and balanced lines to feed a balanced antenna, such as a dipole antenna. Many types of baluns are used to transform unbalanced lines into balanced lines, and vice versa. However, when it comes to the utilization of baluns for antenna measurement, it is not clear whether all types of baluns can reduce the influence of the measurement cable. In this paper, baluns are sorted into two groups with regard to their effect on the reduction in unbalanced current when measuring a small antenna. Furthermore, the effect of a balun on improving the accuracy of impedance and radiation pattern measurements is also investigated.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2911360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8691774","Balance;balun;cable;measurement;small antenna;unbalance","Baluns;Antenna measurements;Impedance;Transmission line measurements;Current measurement;Antenna radiation patterns;Impedance measurement","","21","","22","IEEE","14 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna structure comprises a pair of semicircular microstrip dipolar patches which are orthogonally loaded with another pair of similar patches on the top. Rotating the orientation of the top-loading patch is found to be able to effectively tune the tag antenna's resonant frequency and its impedance. The capacitive and inductive effects introduced by the top-loading patches are crucial for bringing the resonant frequency of the tag antenna down to the useful UHF band. Conjugate impedance matching is achieved between the antenna and the microchip. An equivalent circuit has been constructed to study the impedance characteristics.

Stringent manufacturing tolerances and coupling between feeds tend to penalize performance, which is aggravated for a dual band. This paper proposes a new design of a shared aperture antenna intended for multispot single-feed-per beam satellite applications that allows recovering single-feed performance, minimizing the usual impact of adjacent feeds on the field distribution and ultimately on the antenna directivity and gain. We present a new focal-plane dual-band Fabry-Pérot cavity antenna (FPCA) design, which allows more reliable fabrication, closer agreement with simulations, and larger bandwidth than the reported solutions. It uses only one double-sided printed frequency-selective surface (FSS) to form the dual-band FPCA, and it is fed through a novel arrangement of double-layer slots in the FPCA-printed ground plane. This favors impedance matching and higher isolation between adjacent feeds. The effectiveness of the solution is experimentally demonstrated for a single-feed Ka-band (20 and 30 GHz) prototype. The generalization for a complete multifeed configuration with filters is shown by full-wave simulations.

An equivalent transmission line model for the slot is proposed, based on a spectral domain analysis. First, we introduce a method of moments solution to model semiinfinite or finite slots, fed by a delta-gap excitation. The solution entails only two basis functions, one located at the feed and the other at the termination. The latter basis function is chosen to properly account for the field diffractive behavior at the antenna end points. An approximate circuit model is then introduced, which describes the main mode propagating along the slot as an equivalent transmission line. Lumped impedances are extracted to accurately describe the source and the end points: the reactances account for the reactive nature of the feed and the termination, while the resistances represent the radiated space waves, emerging from both the feed and the end points. This procedure can be used to derive the input impedance of planar slot antennas with arbitrary length in generic layered media or the interaction between multiple feeds within the same slot.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2908112","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) TTW-NXP Partnership Program(grant numbers:15591); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8676262","Equivalent circuit;input impedance;slot antenna","Impedance;Slot antennas;Feeds;Integrated circuit modeling;Dielectrics;Method of moments;Green's function methods","","16","","18","IEEE","29 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the appropriate combination, the proposed ME antenna exhibits an inherent 90°-phase difference at endfire for these two field components. CP end-fire radiation, therefore, can be achieved. Two techniques using the L-probe coupled feeding structure to excite the M-dipole operating at both the basic (0.5λ-) and higher (1.5λ-) modes for the dual-mode resonances and using two pairs of printed strips with different dimensions for the dual-frequency resonances are introduced to realize the wideband operation.

Therefore, the antenna is able to realize good impedance performance within the wide designated bandwidth. Moreover, two transverse slots are etched to suppress undesirable modes, but the slots have a small effect on the current distribution of the two designed modes.

The antenna is capable of receiving the left-handed CP (LHCP) signals in the low band while transmitting the right-handed CP (RHCP) signals in the high band. First, a dual-port cavity-fed linearly polarized (LP) patch antenna with high isolation is developed as the element of the array. The element is composed of a slotted patch, a U-slot loaded substrate integrated cavity (SIC), and two groups of split-ring resonators (SRRs). The LHCP and RHCP operations are achieved by employing two sequentially rotated feeding networks which are isolated by a ground plane. To reduce the mutual coupling between the radiators, narrow slots are etched out in the center of the patches. Importantly, the sharing of patches at different bands (i.e., common aperture) enables a compact footprint to be achieved for the array, which is beneficial for suppressing undesirable grating lobes due to the reduced interelement spacing. The measured results of a fabricated prototype agree well with the simulations, showing an impedance bandwidth of 7.2-7.75 GHz (7.85-8.4 GHz), 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 7.4-7.7 GHz (7.95-8.32 GHz), and gain of 14 dBic (14.2 dBic) at the low band (high band). The channel isolation is over 27 dB and the sidelobe levels are below -15 dB in both bands.

However, previous designs generally made use of single resonance and, hence, only function for one specific incident polarization within a single-frequency band. In this paper, we present a dual-band metasurface based on a concentric rectangular arrangement to control the polarizations of both linearly and circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. We show that, on the one hand, the proposed metasurface structure can convert the polarization of linearly polarized waves to the cross direction in two broad frequency bands 4.40–5.30 GHz and 9.45–13.60 GHz. On the other hand, this design can also reflect circularly polarized waves without changing the handedness in two frequency bands 4.47–5.35 GHz and 9.57–13.57 GHz. For both cases, average polarization conversion efficiency larger than 86% was obtained in our experiment. The numerical simulations reveal that the dual-band cross-polarization coupling results from the strong electric and magnetic resonances between the top and bottom layers. The ultrathin polarization converter experimentally realized in this paper provides an important stepping stone for the future design of other dual-band metasurface devices and is believed to be extendable to higher frequency regimes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2911377","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41474117,61701206); Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2015-T2-1-145); Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1(grant numbers:RG91/17 (S)); Nanyang Technological University; Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(grant numbers:201606770013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692588","Dual band;metasurface;polarization converter","Polarization;Dual band;Frequency measurement;Resonant frequency;Frequency conversion;Metamaterials;Antenna measurements","","170","","46","IEEE","16 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed structure includes a tensor impedance sheet (TIS) alongside a scalar impedance sheet (SIS) which is designed by arrays of cells containing subwavelength patterned metallic cladding over a grounded dielectric substrate. In this structure, a method is presented to study the electromagnetic surface wave (SW) passing through a boundary between an isotropic and anisotropic impedance surface. If an SW with a specified frequency is excited on a SIS and orthogonally propagates onto the boundary of a TIS, due to the refraction of the SW, the propagation direction of the SW on the TIS will change. Therefore, the SW will enter the TIS with a specified angle, which is called the refraction angle. In this paper, the frequency variations of the refraction angle are studied in the proposed structure. Finally using the presented method, a sample structure is designed and simulated in 15.1-15.75 GHz frequency. In addition, the structure is fabricated and the results of the proposed model are verified with simulation and measurement.

The beauty of a single body of revolution (BOR) is that the 3-D problem can be reduced to a series of decoupled 2-D problems thereby not consuming large computational memory and time. However, for a multiple arbitrarily orientated bodies of revolution scattering problem, the modal Green's function (MGF) does not work. In this paper, an approach based on domain decomposition framework MBoRs (DDM-MBoRs) is proposed to solve electromagnetic scattering from MBoRs involving metallic and dielectric objects. First of all, the induced electric or magnetic currents in each single BoR are efficiently solved by a fast inhomogeneous plane wave algorithm (FIPWA). Then BoRs couple with each other via the far-field Green's function. In particular, a modified basis function mapping technique (BFMT) is utilized to project the BoR basis functions to constant vector basis functions, which further makes it flexible to employ multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) to accelerate the mutual coupling of each BoR. In the proposed framework, MBoRs with arbitrarily metallic-dielectric combinations can be efficiently solved. Several numerical results are illustrated to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2911405","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701083,61721001,61425010,61871090); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M633346); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8691722","Basis function mapping technique (BFMT);domain decomposition (DD);metallic-dielectric combinations;multiple bodies of revolution (MBoRs)","Dielectrics;Surface impedance;Acceleration;Green's function methods;Electromagnetic scattering;Magnetic domains","","10","","25","IEEE","14 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the course of rays' multiple reflections, the polarization of each ray is found to change in a manner consistent with the variations of its propagating direction, which can be described with an equivalent 3-D rotation transformation. This transformation provides a new representation of the polarization rotation effect induced by multiple reflections. More importantly, the parameters of this transformation characterize the target's GO field response, and their values can classify six classes of geometrical structures. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulas relating these parameters to target's geometrical attributes for double and triple reflections, by using a quaternion algebra method. In order to validate this representation theory, we construct a parametric model of bistatic scattering from an arbitrary multiplate structure, by combining the GO-physical optics (PO) method with this representation. Through two special cases, the representation theory is validated by comparing the RCSs calculated by the parametric model with those by a shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) algorithm.

However, these usually simply assume the usual antenna far-field radiation characteristics. Here, we discuss three antenna effects that can deteriorate the overall imaging performance but are rarely addressed in the literature: antenna internal reflections, angular dispersion of the “near-field phase center,” and antenna frequency dispersive electric length. We propose dedicated methods to characterize these factors and present mitigation strategies to be integrated into the inversion algorithms. We demonstrate these effects for three frequently used broadband antennas, using signals from an experimental breast imaging lab setup.

Then, the excitation phases are decomposed into two parts and generated by the reconfigurable radiators and reconfigurable feed network, respectively. In addition, p-i-n diodes are selected as switches to control the operating states of the radiators and feed network. Therefore, OAM-mode switching capability can be obtained by altering the direct current (dc) bias configurations of the diodes. The antenna design is validated by both simulation and measurement. Results indicate that the proposed eight-element array antenna produces six operating states corresponding to OAM modes l = ±1, ±2, and ±3. The measured overlapped band among the states with  $\vert \text{S}_{\mathbf {11}}\vert < -15$  dB covers 2.33–2.73 GHz. Moreover, the proposed antenna also features the advantages of easy fabrication and low cost.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2916595","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JB190410); Defense Basic Research Program(grant numbers:JCKY2016210B002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51775405,51490664); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718527","Mode switching;orbital angular momentum (OAM);reconfigurable antenna;reconfigurable feed network;uniform circular array (UCA)","Switches;Antenna feeds;Phased arrays;P-i-n diodes","","45","","20","IEEE","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A discrete Fourier transform (DFT) feed network is used at both sides to realize quasieigenmode transmission, where mode orthogonalization is achieved by using just analog circuits; digital interference cancellation is not used. The key idea of the proposed method is its mode selection technique, which simply chooses some of the highest modes and distributes all available power to the chosen modes equally.

The new method can not only eliminate the effect of complicated transition structures, but can also be suitable for higher order modes. In addition, attenuation constants can be extracted, and it can also theoretically provide a possibility to break the limitations of uniform and reciprocal structures. Based on this method, all dispersion curves in different propagation directions are obtained. For example, dispersion curves are measured for two cases, a nearly uniform spoof SPP TL and a single unit of spoof SPP structure, to demonstrate the validity of this method. It is shown that the measured dispersion curves agree well with the simulation results based on eigenmode solver.

The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and array theory are combined to optimize and select appropriate parameters for unit cells. The optimized unit cells (O-cells) simultaneously realize the polarization conversion and destructive interference to reduce copolarized RCS. In addition, mirrors of these O-cells (M-cells) are adopted to achieve the complete destructive interference to reduce cross-polarized RCS. Therefore, the total monostatic RCS can be greatly reduced. To improve the bistatic RCS reduction, random distribution of unit cells is carefully designed to realize diffusion patterns. In both the simulation and measurement results, a 10 dB monostatic RCS reduction at the normal incidence is achieved from 7.5 to 22.5 GHz (100% bandwidth).
