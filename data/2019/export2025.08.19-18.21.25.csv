It is shown that the limit of this mode of transmission is dictated by the amount of information that an electromagnetic field is capable of carrying. The methodology for the analysis of this problem is along the theory developed by Kolmogorov. This allows one to quantify the amount of information that can be transmitted by a wireless communication system taking into account the physical limitations governed by the laws of electromagnetism. Starting from the results related to the amount of information carried by an electromagnetic field, a novel antenna synthesis technique that simultaneously takes into account the requirements of information and antenna theory is introduced and applied to the synthesis of multiantenna systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2889158","MIUR Program “Dipartimenti di Eccellenza 2018–2022.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585146","5G communication systems;antenna synthesis;channel capacity;MIMO subchannels;MIMO systems","Electromagnetics;Current distribution;Reliability theory;MIMO communication;Uncertainty","","50","","30","IEEE","21 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, even for low elevation towers, installation cost is still high. One of the possible ways for the deployment of base station antennas is to install them near the ground in order to do away with the tower. The main purpose of this paper is to suggest installation of the radiating antennas near the ground and tilting their orientation toward the sky—a totally nonintuitive solution. It will be shown that such deployments have the potential of reducing slow fading and can further enhance the signal strength close to the radiating antenna. This paper provides measured data for the received fields to validate the theoretical conjecture of such a deployment in various environments. The measured results are presented for 245, 800, 1000, and 2400 MHz. It is illustrated that such an unorthodox deployment can result in a low cost for the installation of base station antenna as the towers are not necessary. This can be useful in restoring communications in emergency situations where minimum infrastructure exists.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2883658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8550741","Imperfect ground plane;microcellular communications;propagation measurement","Antenna measurements;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Density measurement;Power measurement;Poles and towers","","2","","19","IEEE","28 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the evaporation duct that commonly forms over water is investigated as part of the Coupled Air-Sea Processes and Electromagnetic ducting Research (CASPER) at-sea experimental campaign conducted off the coast of Duck, NC, USA, during October-November of 2015. Monte Carlo simulations are first used to develop an optimal array of four vertically spaced receiving antennas. In the experiment, the antennas are mounted on the stern A-frame of a research vessel and measure EM signals transmitted from beacons mounted on another research vessel and on the pier at the Army Field Research Facility. While the propagation loss versus range provides a data set similar to previous work, the vertical array can provide sampling of modes in the leaky waveguide formed in the duct. Combining both the range and height sampling results in a robust inversion method for evaporation duct estimation. In this paper, the efficacy of the four-element array is demonstrated by estimation of the evaporation duct height through comparison with a library of precomputed propagation curves generated using the parabolic wave equation. Low model error gives confidence in the estimates, which are consistent with the concurrent environmental measurements performed by the CASPER team. It is found that the evaporation duct can vary significantly with range and time over the duration of a data collection run.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2894269","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00244-14-2-0005,N00014-16-1-2989); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624585","Environmental factors;inverse problems;parabolic wave equation;propagation measurements;refractivity;weather forecasting","Ducts;Atmospheric measurements;Refractive index;Sea measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Ocean temperature;Sea surface","","30","","31","IEEE","23 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the first stage, the spherical electromagnetic waves originating from the patch antenna are converted to plane waves by placing the planar MS lens at a height of  $0.55\lambda _{0}$  above the antenna aperture. This lens enhances the radiation along the broadside direction resulting in high-gain operation. Furthermore, a concept of the digital metamaterial is adopted by realizing 1 bit transmission-type coding MSs, capable of splitting the aforementioned high-gain beam pattern. These digital MSs (DMSs) have two different types of metaatoms with phase responses of 0 and  $\pi $ , corresponding to two basic digital elements 0 and 1, respectively. The assembly of these metamaterial bits (either 0 or 1) leads to a lattice of size  $D \times D$ . The proper spatial mixture of these lattices with different sequences facilitates different elemental metamaterial-pattern resulting in multiple-lobe radiation patterns, which are angularly oriented and symmetrical to the antenna axis. The designed planar lens and the DMS with the individual thickness of  $0.057\lambda _{0}$  are placed in the near field of antenna leading to an overall compact configuration with a total height of  $1.08\lambda _{0}$ . The aforementioned beam splitting using the proposed configuration is also validated both quantitatively (mathematically) and qualitatively (through the simulation and the measurement) for different types of DMSs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2891755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8607007","Compact structure;digital metasurface (DMS);high-gain antenna;multibeam antenna;planar lens;spherical electromagnetic (EM) waves;split beam antenna","Lenses;Patch antennas;Lattices;Encoding;Apertures;Metamaterials","","45","","45","IEEE","10 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, it has been observed that the path loss exponent is independent of the nature of the ground parameters inside the cell of interest. Second, the electrical parameters of the environment have little effect on the path loss exponent in the cellular band. Third, it is observed that lowering the base station antenna toward the ground provides a stronger signal in the near field within the cell of interest. Furthermore, tilting the transmitting antenna toward the sky enhances the signal strength. Tilting the antenna toward the ground increases the signal strength but, in addition, enhances the interference pattern and, hence, is not a good solution. A typical path loss inside the cell is 30 dB per decade of distance, and outside the cell, it increases to 40 dB per decade. By bringing the antenna closer to the ground and then tilting it toward the sky, a good nonintuitive solution is provided. In such scenarios, a path loss of 20 dB per decade for some components of the field, the lowest possible, can be achieved for certain orientations and deployment of the base station antenna. In addition, it is shown that operating an antenna inside a metallic box eliminates its radiation capabilities and, hence, has no physical meaning even though it is claimed in the contemporary literature that it simulates a rich multipath environment. Finally, a note on the proper interpretation of the term channel capacity and its implications is delineated.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2891658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8606954","Cellular radio wave propagation;channel capacity;nonradiating antenna;path loss exponent;physics-based macromodel;receiving antenna;transmitting antenna;wireless transmission","Receiving antennas;Dipole antennas;Propagation losses;Transmitting antennas;Wireless communication;Base stations","","7","","28","IEEE","10 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a method for computing the TSW excitation efficiency is proposed for the first time and it can be applied to different kinds of reactive surface geometries and transducer apertures. Then, the relation between the TSW excitation efficiency, surface reactance, and aperture height is derived. Then, the maximum excitation efficiency, the corresponding optimal surface reactance, and aperture height are presented. Furthermore, the relation between the TSW angular coverage and aperture width is determined. These studies show that the aperture height mainly determines the TSW excitation efficiencies, while the aperture width controls the TSW angular coverage; hence, the two aperture parameters of a transducer can be independently determined.

The discrete nature of rays with no thickness shows a weakness in the aggregation step where nearby rays to the observation point need to be detected and differentiated. The fact that angular defect cannot be distributed evenly for more than 12 rays in space leads to a double-counting (DC) phenomenon, i.e., the radius of a reception sphere cannot exclude all but 1 ray per wavefront. This either leads to significant signal errors or requires the use of space- and time-consuming wavefront differentiation. Bloom filters configured with marginal false-positive rate are proposed here as a replacement of the exact wavefront differentiation, effectively eliminating DC errors. Substantial space gains while computing channel impulse responses are reported. Furthermore, due to the importance of ray-launching template grids for DC avoidance, the analytical angular bounds for the two common icosahedral grids are presented.
