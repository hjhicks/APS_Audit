The structure consists of a 2-D periodic arrangement of narrow rectangular patches on a grounded dielectric substrate, excited by a simple source such as a slot in the ground plane. A 2-D periodic LWA can be designed to radiate a narrow pencil beam pattern at broadside by adjusting its geometric parameters. The main beam at broadside is narrower in the E-plane than in the H-plane, and there are also grating lobes introduced due to the periodicity. The structure has been analyzed theoretically using the periodic spectral-domain immittance (periodic SDI) method. The proposed antenna has also been simulated using both FEM and method of moments methods and a fabricated design has been measured. A good correlation is observed between the theoretical, simulated, and measured radiation patterns.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2902639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657963","2-D periodic leaky-wave antenna (LWA);periodic LWA","Two dimensional displays;Leaky wave antennas;Magnetic domains;Surface waves;Gratings;Substrates","","23","","49","IEEE","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The PDN is composed of sections of transmission lines (TLs) and reactive components, allowing additional power-traveling paths. With the TL lengths and reactive-component reactances being precisely determined, the traveling power from one antenna to another could cancel out the undesired power wave induced by mutual coupling, resulting in the high port isolation. The decoupling theory is rigorously derived with the design procedure of the PDN systematically described in connection with two examples of the two- and three-element monopole arrays. The measurement results show that good impedance matching for each antenna port, isolations of more than 25 dB, total efficiencies of more than 64%, and envelop correlation coefficients (ECCs) of less than 0.07 are attained simultaneously for both examples using the proposed PDN.

Specifically, it is found that, even in the infinite-aperture case, the beam properties considerably change for certain combinations of the phase and the attenuation constants, and different radiation regimes are identified here. New analytic formulas are provided to exactly evaluate the beamwidth of an infinite 1-D bidirectional LWA operating in any radiating regime. However, when the antenna truncation is accounted for, the boundaries between the radiating regimes change as the radiation efficiency changes. Analytic formulas are, therefore, provided to accurately calculate such boundaries for any practical radiation efficiency. The interesting case of a finite-length bidirectional 1-D LWA radiating at broadside is then extensively discussed. With respect to previous beamwidth formulas found in the literature, the new formulas take into account the finiteness of the aperture, thus providing more useful and reliable results, especially in cases when the aperture truncation considerably affects the radiation efficiency. The numerical results corroborate the accuracy of the proposed expressions. These new formulas not only significantly improve the accuracy of the existing ones but also lay the groundwork for the analysis of the beamwidth properties of the important case of 2-D LWAs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2906014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668819","Beamwidth;broadside radiation;leaky waves;leaky-wave antennas (LWAs)","Apertures;Density measurement;Power system measurements;Attenuation;Leaky wave antennas;Directive antennas","","25","","16","IEEE","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These slots are divided into two subarrays of eight slots, each one generating either a sum or a difference pattern along the E-plane. Two pillbox systems are used to feed the two subarrays, and therefore, the radiation patterns can be steered in the H-plane. Such a reconfigurability, both in the E- and H-planes, has not been reported with CTS antennas. Moreover, the recently introduced the substrate-integrated PPW (SI-PPW) technology is used in the printed circuit board technology for complete integration of the antenna module.

The EM modeling of the circuit provides the possibility to identify the key parameters that mostly affect the performance of the antenna in terms of bandwidth and efficiency.

Unlike common measures, the maximum E -field difference between a single antenna element and its array is proposed to evaluate the strength of mutual coupling. This measure is suitable for high-power antenna arrays and validated by comparing with other indexes, such as S-parameter, gain, and axial ratio. Because high-frequency current and the E -field are closely related, the full-wave method is used to calculate the current amplitude distribution over a single helical antenna and the scattering E -field of an antenna array. Since the antenna elements mutually coupled through the air, several approaches are discussed for suppressing the mutual coupling. It is verified that using cavity not only isolates the antenna elements well but it is also with high power capacity. The results indicate that each antenna element is able to handle high pulsed power. Besides, it could be seen that the decrease in mutual coupling is helpful for improving the power capacity.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2905735","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2018GF09,2018GF10); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668533","Antenna array;electric field;helical antenna;mutual coupling;power capacity","Antenna arrays;Mutual coupling;Helical antennas;Couplings;Antenna measurements;Scattering","","4","","24","IEEE","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The DTC is able to produce two coaxial equivalent magnetic dipoles polarized in the same direction, which can not only excite the TM01 mode of a patch antenna but also create another resonance, leading to a wideband impedance bandwidth. The working mechanism is explained in this paper by physics intuition. To validate the new feeding structure, a linear-polarized and a dual-polarized patch antenna prototypes working in the 3.5 GHz band are designed, manufactured, and measured.

The switchable phase of the metasurface was obtained by realizing air holes of equal dimensions inside the dielectric polylactic acid (PLA) substrate using 3-D-printing technology. The simplicity of the approach is acquired from the beam-steering properties through programmable water injection in different channels. Beam steering of ± 20° in the elevation plane with a 10 dB impedance bandwidth of 2.57-2.64 GHz was achieved. A stable radiation gain of more than 6 dBi was demonstrated across the operating bandwidth. To validate the concept, an antenna prototype was fabricated, and far-field measurements were performed. The simulation and measurement results showed good agreement and confirmed the proposed concept. The proposed antenna has a low profile and was fabricated at low cost and thus is a cheap and accessible way to control the electromagnetic waves in the microwave region using water.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2905690","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2018R1A4A1023826); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668465","3-D printing;beam-steering antenna;fluidically programmable metasurface (FPMS);partially reflecting surface (PRS)","Antennas;Substrates;Switches;Dielectric constant;Metamaterials;Reflection","","91","","38","IEEE","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key element of the proposed approach is the exploitation of a conical element pattern (EP) with high directivity in elevation, obtained through the excitation of a dominant, weakly attenuated cylindrical TM leaky wave of azimuthal order n = 0 by means of a simple coaxial probe. Then, a highly reduced number N of such sources are arranged to form a phased array radiating directive pencil beams. Beam-angle reconfigurability with continuous scanning both in azimuth and elevation inside a wide solid angular range is achieved by varying the array phasing and the operating frequency. An investigation on the features of truncated cylindrical leaky waves is first developed to properly characterize the EP. Then, conventional array theory is exploited to calculate the pattern of the entire array. The radiation efficiency is also evaluated accounting for the spurious surface wave related to the undesired excitation of the quasi-TEM mode. The proposed array design provides a simple and inexpensive innovative solution for obtaining a high-gain pencil beam continuously scanning in the 3-D space without suffering gain losses. In the presented implementation, the elevation angular scan, which is generally constrained by the wideband capability of the feeding system, by the requirements on the sidelobe level, and by the cutoff of the relevant leaky mode, ranges from about 21° to about 68°. Possible applications are envisaged for the next generation of wireless power transfer devices, for advanced radar and surveillance systems, earth observation, as well as for ceiling-mounted indoor localization and tracking.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2902678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657992","Beam steering;conical patterns;cylindrical leaky waves (CLWs);Fabry–Perot cavity antennas (FPCAs);phased arrays","Phased arrays;Cavity resonators;Fabry-Perot;Azimuth;Probes","","36","","54","IEEE","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, the algorithm becomes less susceptible to unpredicted interference signals than conventional beamformers. In each iteration, the algorithm finds the direction of the peak of the greatest sidelobe, which is considered as direction of arrival (DoA) of a hypothetical interference signal, and the conventional beamformer is then employed to find proper antenna array weights that produce an extra null toward this direction. The iterative procedure stops when the desired SLL is obtained. The algorithm is applied on three conventional beamformers and is tested for various signal DoA, while the direction deviation of the main lobe and the nulls is recorded, to evaluate the algorithm in terms of robustness. The proposed algorithm needs a few iterations to achieve the desired SLL and thus is much faster than any evolutionary iterative method employed for sidelobe suppression.

For good MIMO performance, uncorrelated antenna ports are generally required. In order to analyze the port correlation, symmetry analysis based on group theory and matrix representations is applied to the theory of characteristic modes. The characteristic surface current densities act as basis functions of the irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the antenna. Current densities belonging to different representations or belonging to different rows of the same representation are orthogonal to each other and can, thus, be excited separately. Therefore, an upper bound for the number of uncorrelated antenna ports can be derived for a given antenna structure based on the symmetry analysis of the characteristic modes. Furthermore, design guidelines on which antenna geometry to choose in order to realize a given number of uncorrelated antenna ports and on how to implement these ports can be deduced.

They exploit “uniformly sampled” exponentials to interpolate the “nonuniformly sampled” ones involved in the nonuniform discrete Fourier transforms (NUFDTs), so as to enable the use of standard fast Fourier transforms, and an optimized window. The computational costs and the memory requirements are analyzed, and their convenient performance is assessed also by comparing them with other approaches in the literature. Numerical results demonstrate that the method is more accurate and does not introduce any additional computational or memory burden. The computation of the window functions amounts to that of a Legendre polynomial expansion, i.e., a simple polynomial evaluation. This is convenient in terms of computational burden and of the proper arrangement of the calculations.

Although the MOD scheme is assumed to be stable and accurate, there exists little investigation into the accuracy of the integral operations involving the associated Laguerre functions of high degree. It is shown in this paper that the numerical quadrature for integrating the highly oscillatory Laguerre functions may not be accurate and this may result in instability for the MOD solvers. In this paper, the highly oscillatory nature of the high-degree associated Laguerre functions is investigated first. Based on that, the numerical procedures are described which result in the inaccuracy of the numerical quadrature associated with the highly oscillatory nature for the higher order Laguerre functions. This can produce instability for the MOD solvers when a solution requires a high degree of the Laguerre functions. Hence, a novel Filon-type quadrature method and a stabilized MOD technique for time-domain magnetic field integral equations (TD-MFIE-SMOD) are presented in this paper.

Contrary to the field-based approach which deals with the electric and magnetic fields, we employ a potential-based formalism instead, involving vector and scalar potentials, and match them at the media interfaces. The proposed approach can handle not only conventional plasmonic waveguides on the order of a few hundred nanometers but also those whose critical sizes are a few nanometers and in which the nonlocal hydrodynamic effects need to be accounted for.

Experiments are conducted in silty clay loam, sandy, and silt loam soil, to characterize the effects of soil, in an indoor testbed and field testbeds. It is shown that at subsurface burial depths (0.1-0.4 m), the change in soil moisture impacts communication by resulting in a shift in the resonant frequency of the antenna.

This model allows system engineers to predict the underground antenna resonance and also helps to design an efficient communication system in IOUT. Accordingly, a wideband planar antenna is designed for an agricultural IOUT application.

This further enables the explanation that uniaxial PML matrix solves only the coordinately aligned terminations. Temporal implicit and spatial explicit representations are presented. Solving Robin impedance-matched solutions, thus, amounts to merely relabeling the corresponding boundary variable name.

Due to the different attenuation properties for the ordinary wave (O-wave) and the extraordinary wave (E-wave), the integrals corresponding to their contributions should be truncated at different locations of the real axis and need to be separately treated. By applying the complex function theory and a speed-up convergence algorithm, the original oscillating integral for the near-field is transformed into two fast convergent integrals plus an analytical solution. Computations show that, in the near zone, the O-wave still has comparable amplitudes with the E-wave, and its influence on the total field should not be neglected. It is also observed from the radiation pattern that there exists a pronounced “cohesion effect” for the E-wave along the direction of the geomagnetic field, while the phase mutations of the O-wave exactly coincide with the minima of its field strength. Moreover, it is found that the radiation ability of a VLF electric dipole in an anisotropic plasma will increase with the operating frequency.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2905663","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571389,61271086); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668434","Anisotropic ionosphere;near-field;very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic wave","Ionosphere;Plasmas;Dipole antennas;Satellite broadcasting;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Magnetic separation","","17","","25","IEEE","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The process takes the following steps: 1) NF lateral scanning; 2) inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) computation; 3) scattering centers (SCs) extraction; and 4) computation of the RCS.

The penetrable cloaking metasurface cavity is introduced here as a new form of cloaking, which is more realistic than transformation-electromagnetics cloaking while providing comparable performance for a given direction of wave incidence and an a priori known object to conceal. A monoanisotropic metasurface requires gain for perfect cloaking, but a purely passive approximation of it, practically more accessible, still provides remarkable extinction cross section reduction. Moreover, introducing proper bianisotropy leads to perfect cloaking while keeping the metasurface structure purely passive and lossless.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2905711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668502","Bianisotropic susceptibilities;cloaking;generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs);illusion optics;integral equation (IE);metasurface;method of moments (MoM);scattering","Cavity resonators;Scattering;Method of moments;Integral equations;Magnetic susceptibility;Antennas","","41","","34","IEEE","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More recent work has moved toward the UHF band (300 MHz-3 GHz), with models showing maximal efficiency is achieved at these frequencies. However, for many applications, maximizing efficiency is a secondary goal to maximizing received power at the implant, and it remains unclear whether the optimal frequency for efficiency is different than the optimal frequency for maximizing received power. Furthermore, previous models generally do not include a ferrite core in the implant, which could shift the optimal frequency. To address these questions, we developed a theoretical model with frequency-dependent ferrite permeability and dispersive tissue. We show that when a ferrite core is included, the optimal frequency for efficiency remains in the UHF band. Conversely, when maximizing received power rather than efficiency, both high (>300 MHz) and low (<;10 MHz) frequencies yield similar levels of received power, and this remains true with or without a ferrite core. For shallow implants, heating of the core can reach unsafe levels when operated in the UHF band at field levels approaching the specific absorption rate (SAR) limit. These results have implications for a wide range of medical applications, including sub-millimeter-sized implants and fast recharge of implantable batteries.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2905672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668531","Ferrite core;implantable devices;wireless power","Magnetic cores;Ferrites;Biological tissues;Implants;Permeability;Biological system modeling;Heating systems","","26","","50","IEEE","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we examine the role that fluctuations in temperature and humidity conditions play in the measurement uncertainty of electromagnetic signals. A common issue in all tests is the attenuation of the propagated signal, so we first present the relation between signal attenuation, temperature, and humidity. Then, we quantify the uncertainty in the measured signal for some actual cases at certain conditions, starting by the attenuation effect and then considering other case-specific deviations. We aimed to summarize the steps to compute the uncertainty associated with environmental conditions and to show that the relevance of each factor is case specific. Apparently, low values could contribute to the uncertainty budget.

Accurate emulation of radio wave propagation in target scenario guarantees that the device under test (DUT) be assessed fairly in the laboratory. Dynamic multipath scenario and orthogonal polarization can be emulated by exciting the multiple probes in such a way that the total fields from probes resemble the target impinging field in the test zone. The excitation voltages can be either calculated by PW or SVW theories. Despite the fact that PW and SVW are mathematically equal in the far field, different treatments on rotation and translation of waves as well as different linear equations used in two methods result in different computed voltages, hence, different emulated fields. The emulation performances of the two methods with different MPAC setups (e.g., test zone size, probe number, probe sphere radius, and probe directivity) are investigated.

Such approximations may lead to nonoptimal designs in terms of operating frequency, size, and coil orientation. This paper presents an optimal design approach for maximizing the channel capacity, using both MQS analysis and full-wave (FW) analysis while incorporating HF effects, such as skin and proximity effects, radiation losses, and the self-resonance of coils. For a given medium and required transmission distance, the optimal operating frequency is such, for which the receiver is located in the radiative near field (NF) and not in the reactive NF. The optimal power allocation and the resulting channel capacity were obtained using a “water-filling” algorithm. The HF effects reduced the signal-to-noise ratio and limited the operating frequency and the coil size. This is especially true for short-distance transmission through low-loss media, where the optimal signal frequency is relatively high. In addition, FW analysis significantly improved potential data rates compared to the typical MQS approach. This improvement was achieved due to a higher operating frequency and sometimes a change of mutual orientation from coaxial to parallel. Electromagnetic simulations validated the primary effects presented here.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2902707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657954","Channel capacity;computational electromagnetics (CEMs);electromagnetic induction;electromagnetic radiation;near-field (NF) communication;wireless communication;wireless power transfer","Coils;Magnetic resonance;Resistance;Channel capacity;Media;Signal to noise ratio","","4","","60","IEEE","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the height of the overhead power lines can be comparable or even larger than the smallest wavelength of typical EMP and IEMI pulses, the classical transmission line approximation might not be suitable for evaluating the line response. On the other hand, a traditional full-wave solver (e.g., method of moments) is computationally inefficient, especially when dealing with long lines. To address these problems, we propose an efficient method to handle the high-frequency electromagnetic field coupling to overhead lines with nonlinear loads above a lossy ground. In the proposed method, the asymptotic approach is adopted and extended to the case of a lossy ground, which handles the problem in a semianalytical way and has a much higher computational efficiency in the case of long lines. Although the proposed method applies to the frequency domain, the case of nonlinear loads can be considered through a combination with the time-marching method.

By using the plane wave spectrum expansion of the probe output, the magnetic fields under test on multiplanes are obtained through a single-plane probe scanning. The proposed transformation can be considered as the extension of the prior probe compensation/calibration methods (where the field on only one plane is derived). The proposed method is validated with both numerical and experimental examples. A good agreement between the results of the proposed method and the full-wave simulation is achieved.

The proposed antenna is composed of a patch radiator and a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity. In this work, a square SIW cavity is concentrically embedded within a square patch radiator. Here, the two dominant resonant modes in the radiative patch resonator and nonradiative SIW cavity, namely, TM10 and TE21, are both employed to achieve a wide impedance bandwidth under dual resonances. At first, the resonant properties of these two modes are investigated based on the cavity model theory. Then, their resonant frequencies are extensively discussed, aiming at reallocation of these two modes in proximity to each other by properly selecting the geometrical dimensions of the square patch resonator and SIW cavity. After that, the spacing between adjacent metallic pins of the SIW cavity is studied to reveal its influence on both radiation and bandwidth properties. As such, proper spacing is selected toward stable radiation gain over the whole band of operation. Finally, the feeding positions of the MPA are studied to determine the input impedance of the antenna toward wide impedance matching in a wideband. To verify the predicted results, a prototype antenna is fabricated and measured. The simulated and measured results are found in good agreement with each other and both of them illustrate that the proposed antenna achieves a wide bandwidth of about 11.43% at a center frequency of 3.5 GHz and a stable gain in the range of 8.09 to 9.04 dBi within the whole band.

If both array factors are uniform, then the expected peak two-way SLL is a little less than -27 dB.

Without requiring periodicity in two dimensions, the proposed MS can thus be integrated more flexibly in many applications. Based on the proposed MS, a patch antenna array is proposed. Full-wave simulations and measurements show that, by incorporating the proposed MS, the scattering of the antenna array can be reduced by more than 5 dB over the antenna operating frequency band from 10.7 to 12 GHz (11.45%) under normal incidence.

Therefore, two separated aims are obtained in one structure using the plexiglass material and mono solar cell. Initially, the EM wave interactions with both materials are determined. Then, by the use of the wave interactions and scattering theory, two different surfaces are analytically investigated with the aim of transparent backscattering reduction cover. Next, an optimization algorithm is employed to achieve the minimum reflection from the adjacent surfaces. To validate the design performance, a prototype is manufactured. The proposed chessboard cover with plexiglass material is numerically and experimentally analyzed and compared together, having an acceptable agreement.
