To solve this contradiction, we propose a novel design of circularly polarized metasurface antenna characterized by low RCS but high gain. Split ring resonators (SRRs) play a twofold role as the array elements for linear polarization and as the unit cells of metasurface for RCS reduction (RCSR). Four 2 × 2 arrayed SRRs are positioned with orthogonal orientations as a super-array element (SAE) and fed with a phase shift of 90° in between for left-handed circular polarization. On the other hand, based on its original arrangement, the open-circuited SAE is also designed to be the super-cell of a (0°, 180°) reflective checkerboard metasurface. Owing to anti-phase energy cancellation and scattering, both the in-band and out-of-band RCS can be dramatically reduced. As indicated by the measurements in antenna, the fabricated prototype operating in X-band exhibits a combined bandwidth (3 dB axial ratio (AR), 3 dB gain drop, and -10 dB impedance matching) of 16% with a maximum realized gain of 17.9 dB. Besides, under normal illumination, the measured specular reflection has been reduced by 10 dB within 9.2-10.8 GHz and by 7.5 dB from 10.8 to 14 GHz. This design method simultaneously ensures high-gain antenna performance as well as meets the requirement for low RCS.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2920355","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771485,61331005,61471388,61501503,61601507); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:SQ2017YFA0700201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8745698","Array antenna;checkerboard metasurface (CM);circular polarization;high gain;radar cross section (RCS) reduction","Reflection;Antenna arrays;Bandwidth;Antenna measurements;Microstrip;Antenna radiation patterns","","62","","25","IEEE","25 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed configuration, the antenna subsystem comprises a specially designed differentially fed microstrip patch antenna (source antenna) along with a polarization rotator (PR). The differential antenna arrangement is realized using a square shaped microstrip patch capacitively coupled with two metallic strips, which are connected to a specially designed wideband hybrid coupler using two metallic vias for the microstrip feeding. This source antenna is loaded with a PR by placing it at a height of 0.35λ0 from the radiating aperture. The PR comprised two identical metallic layer patterns, separated by two substrates. Depending upon the relative orientation of these layers, the polarization of the linearly polarized impinging spherical electromagnetic (EM) waves (originating from the source antenna) either remains preserved or gets rotated by 90° while transmitting through this PR. After realizing the antenna subsystem, a novel AMS lens is designed and placed above the PR. The proposed AMS lens is realized by integrating two cylindrical MS (CMS) lenses, CMSY and CMSX. This integration provides a unique phase profile to the AMS lens, thus introducing appropriate phase correction to the incident orthogonally polarized spherical EM waves along their respective polarization direction. The proposed configuration of AMS lens, thus, results into formation of the independent dual-polarized fan-beam radiation beams. Finally, the steering of the generated fan-beams along the direction of their respective polarization is facilitated using the proposed system by translating the AMS lens parallel to the source antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2930128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8782043","Anisotropic metasurface (AMS);beam-scanning;capacitive coupling;cylindrical phase profile;differential feed;dual-polarized;fan-beam;hybrid coupler;polarization rotator (PR)","Lenses;Antenna radiation patterns;Microstrip antennas;Apertures;Radar antennas;Radar imaging","","20","","34","IEEE","30 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the mechanical, electrical, and optical characteristics of the proposed composite material have been investigated to analyze its suitability for transparent flexible antenna realization. For concept demonstration, a prototype of a dual-band antenna operating at 2.33-2.53 GHz and 4.7-5.6 GHz has been fabricated and tested. These frequencies cover both the instrument, scientific, and measurement (ISM) and the wireless local area network (WLAN) bands. Full ground plane is utilized in the antenna design for on-body operations. The suitability of the antenna for wearable applications has been investigated by measuring its performance under physical deformation and testing its performance on phantom.

In the proposed configuration, four upper-band antenna elements are placed over the aperture of the lower-band antenna. Four metallic sheets are introduced to provide capacitive loading for the lower-band antenna and simultaneously offer a ground plane for the upper-band antennas. Therefore, low-profile characteristic and high isolations between the dual-band antennas are guaranteed. The overall height of the antenna array is only 0.17λL0 (λL0 is the free-space wavelength at the center frequency of the lower band), which is much lower than those of conventional designs. The measured results demonstrate that the designed antenna array achieves 32.7% and 33.3% impedance bandwidth in the lower and upper bands, respectively. High port isolations (>30 dB), high gains (>8 dBi), and stable radiation patterns are achieved in the two frequency bands.

However, designing implantable antennas is challenging, since compact structure, large bandwidth, and relatively high gain are required at the same time in the lossy human tissue. In this paper, we analytically derive the electromagnetic (EM) fields of the electric and magnetic dipoles in the lossy human tissue and compare their radiation performance. Based on the analysis, a coupled small loop antenna is designed to obtain a large bandwidth of 74.1% when embedded in the muscle. The antenna is composed of an inner loop and an outer loop with printed capacitive structures, and it can also be rolled up into a capsule using flexible substrate. The overall dimension is 30 × 16 × 0.5 mm3 and π × (5)2 × 16 mm3 for the planar and the capsule structure, respectively. Compared with other implantable antennas, a relatively high gain of -23.19 dBi has been achieved for the planar small loop, as the magnetic antenna suffers from less power dissipation in the human tissue. The specific absorption rate (SAR) of the antenna is 177 W/kg with an input power of 1 W, which enables a maximum transmitting power of 9.03 mW according to the IEEE standard. The high transmitting power ensures the reliable communication link. The antenna prototypes were fabricated and measured in the minced pork, which has similar EM properties as the human muscle. The simulated and measured results basically agree with each other. The proposed implantable antenna is competitive in its balanced performance of wide band, high gain, low profile, and low SAR.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2930196","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601079,61571087); Northwestern Polytechnical University(grant numbers:DUT19JC06); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M631779,2019T120200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8777294","Biotelemetry;implantable antenna;magnetic antenna;medical device radio communications service (MedRadio);specific absorption rate (SAR)","Dipole antennas;Bandwidth;Conductivity;Magnetic analysis;Antenna theory;Antenna measurements","","31","","28","IEEE","26 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The presented antenna can be equivalent as a combination of a six-port power divider and four crossed folded dipoles. The six-port power divider is composed of two orthogonal input ports and four equal magnitude output ports. Detailed analysis illustrates that the six-port power divider can have wide bandwidth and high isolation under odd-mode excitation and high common-mode suppression under even-mode excitation. Therefore, based on the wideband and high even-mode suppressed six-port power divider, a wideband differentially driven dual-polarized antenna is developed with high common-mode suppression. To validate the design concept, the proposed antenna was designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured results prove that the antenna has a wide impedance bandwidth of 1.64-3.0 GHz (58.6%) for the return loss higher than 15 dB and isolation higher than 35.4 dB. In addition, very high common-mode suppression is achieved for the measured common-mode reflection coefficient higher than -0.87 dB over the entire bandwidth.

Specific filtering response with radiation nulls is firstly realized for the dual-polarized antenna element by symmetrically loading defected ground structures (DGSs), a cross slot, and eight shorting pins without extra circuits. The DGS with pins can generate a lower edge radiation null for a sharp roll-off rate and simultaneously introduce extra in-band resonance for wide passband. Meanwhile, the cross slot with pins can offer an upper edge null and an in-band resonance. Combining with inherent higher order-mode null of the patch itself, the skirt selectivity and stopband suppression at upper band can be significantly improved. Meanwhile, the |Sdd11| at the upper and lower stopbands is close to 0 dB to achieve high stopband suppressions. As a result, a compact high-gain dual-polarized filtering patch antenna is readily constructed. Thanks for complete symmetry of above structures, the proposed method is very suitable for dual-polarized antennas, where all the performance for both polarizations are identical. For demonstration, a prototype of the proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. Good agreements between the measured and simulated results are observed, indicating good performance with a large bandwidth of about 23% and a peak gain of up to 8.9 dBi within the passband, as well as out-of-band suppression levels of more than 20 dB. Compared with other reported filtering antennas, the proposed filtering patch antenna not only exhibits good wideband dual-polarization radiation but also features high gain in a compact structure for very high aperture efficiency and ultralow cross-polarization level due to the differential feeding and complete symmetry.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2930213","Guangdong Province Key Project of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2018B010115001); Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program(grant numbers:2017ZT07X032); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571231,61601224,61822110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8777317","Differential fed;dual polarized;filtering antenna;high gain;radiation null","Gain;Pins;Band-pass filters;Patch antennas;Resonator filters","","105","","25","IEEE","26 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A composite right-/left-handed (CRLH) LWA is developed in this article that facilitates fixed-frequency continuous beam scanning over a wide operational frequency band. A variation of a simple single-layer nonreconfigurable frequency-based continuous beam scanning CRLH LWA is considered first. Its dispersion properties are approximately investigated using an equivalent circuit model. It is reported how two groups of varactor diodes can be incorporated into its basic circuit model to electronically control its dispersion behavior. An optimized reconfigurable CRLH LWA with practical dc biasing lines is then realized from this nonreconfigurable design. Fixed-frequency continuous beam scanning, from backward to forward directions through broadside, is reported over a wide operational frequency band. Simulations predict that the antenna can operate from 4.75 to 5.25 GHz with the main beam being continuously scannable at each frequency point. A prototype was fabricated, assembled, and tested. The measured results confirm its simulated performance characteristics.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2935088","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:160102219); Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA)(grant numbers:DE170101203); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805242","Beam scanning;composite right-/left-handed (CRLH);fixed-frequency;leaky-wave antenna (LWA);reconfigurable antenna","Dispersion;Antennas;Prototypes;Microstrip;Wireless communication;Equivalent circuits;Integrated circuit modeling","","49","","45","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the lossy nature of many tunable components, the use of multiple combined tuning components in a single design seems attractive, as it can distribute the current over the components. However, many combinations of individual tuning component settings can result in an acceptable input match, while they will significantly vary in terms of radiation efficiency. It is challenging to distinguish between these radiating and nonradiating tuning component settings during the design procedure. In this paper, we propose a method to determine the component settings with the highest efficiency at a desired operating frequency. The method uses a single full-wave simulation, which is combined with circuit-level calculations. We discuss how to apply the method in detail and demonstrate its functionality with an inverted-L antenna sporting three tunable barium-strontium titanate capacitors. It is shown that the method can successfully predict tuning component settings for high antenna efficiency over a 1.4-2.8 GHz tuning band, with total efficiencies up to 35% and radiation efficiencies up to 50%. The method can easily be applied to any desired antenna geometry.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2930204","Aeneas/Catrene project EAST; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8777318","Antenna design method;antenna efficiency;frequency-reconfigurable antennas;small antennas","Tuning;Antenna accessories;Geometry;Bandwidth;Aperture antennas;Design methodology","","18","","59","IEEE","26 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we recall the GSTCs, distinguishing the full-tensor (FT) GSTCs and the tangential-tensor (TT) GSTCs, which correspond to the most general and most reported GSTC forms, respectively. We show, by separating tangential and normal polarizations, that the FT-GSTCs involve 36 independent susceptibility parameters, associated with $3\times 3$ electric, magnetic, electric-to-magnetic, and magnetic-to-electric susceptibility tensors, despite the 2-D nature of the structure. Moreover, we find that suppressing the normal polarizations nontrivially reduces the number of FT-GSTC parameters to 24, which is greater than the 16 parameters of the TT-GSTCs. Then, the paper recalls the TBCs as originally reported in a previous study, called here scalar-parameter (SP) TBCs, and extends them to their tensorial-parameter (TP) counterparts, called the TP TBCs. In both formulations, we derive the equivalent susceptibilities in terms of the TBC parameters. We show that the SP-TBCs involve eight equivalent susceptibility parameters, among which only three are independent, while the TP-TBCs involve 16 independent susceptibility parameters. Next, we compare the two models, with their two respective formulations, in terms of both generality and physicality. We deduce from the number of independent susceptibility parameters the following ranking between the four formulations: 1) FT-GSTCs (36 independent parameters); 2) TT-GSTCs = TP-TBCs (16 independent parameters); 3) SP-TBCs (3 independent parameters), and illustrate with examples the property and functionality limitations of the TT-GSTCs, TP-TBCs, and SP-TBCs due to their parameter restrictions.

The resonant frequency can be varied by shifting the upper and lower layers symmetrically. This has the advantages that the same frequency characteristics can be obtained in both vertical and horizontal polarizations and that its fabrication is easy, eliminating the need for electronic elements such as varactor diodes to control capacitance, although the FSS is not suitable for situations that require real-time tuning. This article confirms that the resonant frequency can be varied from f0 to 1.7 f0 in a microwave band which covers multiple wireless bands, with good angular stability in both vertical and horizontal polarizations, by shifting the upper and lower layer overlaps by up to 1.8 mm. Note that f0 is the lowest resonant frequency, and the size of a unit cell is varied from 0.066λ to 0.125λ.

The presented IBC-EFIE formulation is able to handle a variety of problems, e.g., lossy metals, thin dielectrics, thin dielectric-coated conductors, and metasurfaces. Several numerical examples are provided for those problems, and full-wave CMA solutions are used to verify the IBC-EFIE formulation. It is shown that this method is fairly accurate while computationally efficient, which makes CMA a promising tool for large scale or complex composite structures.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2934902","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971018); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFF0204903); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805259","Characteristic mode;composite structures;impedance boundary condition (IBC);lossy metal;metasurface","Surface impedance;Impedance;Surface treatment;Antennas;Dielectric substrates;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","15","","30","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose of this paper is manifold. First, a comprehensive review of well-established PEEC method is given and the state-of-the-art of the method with focus on the inclusion of magnetic media in the formulation is discussed. Then, a new and general formulation of the PEEC method based on integral equations is proposed. The formulation is valid for conductive, dielectric, and magnetic media and its advantages with respect to the state-of-the-art PEEC formulations are underlined. Unlike the existing PEEC methods, this novel formulation, thanks to the reinterpretation of PEEC in the context of integral equation methods, allows for maintaining a circuit interpretation for both electric and magnetic media. Thus, a standard Spice-like solver can in principle be adopted for the solution of electromagnetic (EM) problems also when magnetic media are involved. The imposition of the divergence condition for the current density vectors is guaranteed and also the case of inhomogeneous and anisotropic media is considered. A thorough discussion on the suitability of the method for the study of both low- and high-frequency EM problems is also presented. Finally, the case study of a near-field communication antenna is considered as an example of the applicability of the formulation to problems of industrial interest. Comparisons with commercial softwares, measurements, and the state-of-the-art PEEC method are given in order to demonstrate the accuracy and the advantages of the proposed PEEC formulation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2927789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8764572","Antenna;cell method (CM);inhomogeneous media;integral formulations;near-field communication (NFC);partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC)","Media;Magnetic domains;Dielectrics;Magnetic circuits;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Current density","","30","","49","IEEE","16 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, the compressed components are able to fit inside a graphical processing unit (GPU) on which highly parallelized computations can vastly accelerate the iterative solution of the arising linear system. In addition, the elementwise products throughout the iterative solver's process require additional flops, thus, we provide a variety of novel and efficient methods that maintain the linear complexity of the classic elementwise product with an additional multiplicative small constant.

Metasurface boundaries are represented in terms of surface susceptibilities which when integrated with the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) gave rise to an equivalent configuration in terms of electric and magnetic currents. These representations are then naturally incorporated into the BEM methodology. Four examples are presented for EM scattering of a Gaussian beam to illustrate the proposed method. In the first example, a metasurface is excited with a diverging Gaussian beam, and the scattered fields are validated using a semianalytical method. The second example is concerned with a nonuniform metasurface modeling a diffraction grating, whose results were confirmed with a conventional finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) method. To illustrate the flexibility of the method, the third example uses a metasurface that implements a polarization rotator. Finally, a fully absorbing metasurface is simulated and compared to the FDFD simulations to emphasize the advantages of BEM method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2935131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805251","Boundary element method (BEM);electromagnetic metasurfaces;field scattering;generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs);method of moments (MOMs)","Magnetic susceptibility;Scattering;Magnetic domains;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Numerical models;Surface waves","","23","","29","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The latter exploits the lifting technique to recast phase retrieval as a linear problem with an increased number of unknowns and then, because the linear problem is highly undetermined, it adds further constraints (based on the mathematical properties of the solution) to estimate it. The second approach formulates phase retrieval as a least squares problem and, therefore, it requires to tackle the minimization of a quartic functional which will be carried out by applying a gradient descent method.

It is found that this variation is due the resonant modes, contribution to the received power. Reflected-non-LoS (RNLoS) measurements show that for the same distance, the difference between the mean path loss measured inside the metal box and in a free space is limited to 1 dB, with traveling wave dominating the channel. This indicates that reflectors can be used as wave-guiding objects in metal enclosures. Finally, obstructed-LoS (OLoS) path loss measurements with the parallel dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs) as obstructions show the constructive/destructive effect on the waves due to multipath introduced by the parallel-plate structures.

To accelerate the integral computation, the fast Fourier transform technique (FFT) is adopted which reduces the computational cost from O(N2) to O(N log N). The biconjugate gradient stabilized method (BiCGSTAB) is then applied to solve the EFIE efficiently to calculate the total electric fields in the computational domain.

The proposed method is based on the recently developed semianalytical method known as the generalized Wiener-Hopf technique that extends the applicability of classical Wiener-Hopf method to a new variety of problems constituted of different geometries and materials. In this article, the method is further extended and it is now capable of handling piecewise constant inhomogeneous dielectric layers by resorting to the application of characteristic Green's function procedure starting from the wave equation.

When there are multiple transmitter chains operating at a single frequency, the process of determining compliance is complicated by the fact that testing needs to cover all possible combinations of transmissions from all antennas. For N antennas, the number of possible distinct transmitted signals can grow quickly with N. We propose a compliance test whose measurement time burden is linear in N, independently of the number or type of transmitted signals. For N ≥ 3 antennas, the proposed test requires 7N - 12 excitations and corresponding measurements per probe location. Using analysis, simulations, and measurements with SAR compliance tools, we establish the accuracy of the method as compared with exhaustive measurements over all possible transmitted signals. The method is useful in evaluating the compliance of portable devices that use codebooks or beamforming as part of their transmission capabilities.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2925135","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1403458,ECCS-1509188); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753734","Electromagnetic wave absorption;exposure;mobile handsets;specific absorption rate (SAR);transmitting antennas","Antenna measurements;Transmitting antennas;Electromagnetics;Time measurement;Wireless communication;Power measurement;Array signal processing","","6","","43","IEEE","2 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, the minimum number of samples for a sparse recovery is determined such that a predefined far-field accuracy can be achieved. As no suitable sampling theorem exists, this is done by performing extensive numerical simulations, considering possible deviations from exact sparsity, the influence of measurement noise, the sampling scheme, and the probe correction. Particularly, the influences are determined not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. The resulting modified phase transition diagrams (PTDs) show that a reconstruction by the quadratically constraint basis pursuit strategy is sufficiently stable and robust for practical purposes. The simulation and measurement results of NFFFTs show that the predictions for the required number of samples hold true. Consequently, the presented approach using modified PTDs allows to reduce the number of measurement samples with predictable accuracy, when the sparsity level is known.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2935102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805243","Antenna measurements;compressed sensing (CS);compressive sampling;near-field to far-field transformation (NFFFT);sparse recovery;spherical vector wave expansion","Antenna measurements;Probes;Noise measurement;Antenna theory;Harmonic analysis;Compressed sensing;Optical variables measurement","","39","","67","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It relates the electrical size of the antenna to its quality factor, which can be further related to the bandwidth × efficiency product. Friedman designed a top-loaded monopole that is particularly broadband given its size, but it is not intuitively obvious how to design the matching structure in terms of effective circuit parameters. In this article, we follow Friedman's approach in that we start with designing a matching circuit for a simple top-loaded monopole and obtain performance similar to Friedman's. However, our design is advantageous in two important ways: 1) the circuit is easily understandable and 2) the correspondence between circuit elements and geometrical features on the antenna is clear and straightforward. These advantages may potentially allow this method to be applied to other types of antennas or scaled to different performance parameters.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2934526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8804350","Antenna input impedance;impedance matching;omnidirectional antennas","RLC circuits;Broadband antennas;Capacitors;Inductance;Bandwidth;Shape","","8","","24","IEEE","16 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, it was reported that the modified Lorentz model can cover Debye, Drude, Lorentz, critical point, and quadratic complex rational function models. In this work, it is illustrated that the modified Lorentz model can also cover the complex-conjugate pole-residue model which is one of the most popular dispersion models. Modified Lorentz-based dispersive FDTD has not been thoroughly studied, especially for numerical aspects. In this work, we investigate auxiliary differential equation (ADE)-FDTD formulations for the modified Lorentz model based on electric flux density (D), current (J), or polarization (P). We perform a comprehensive study on memory requirement, the number of arithmetic operations, numerical stability, and numerical permittivity for the above three ADE-FDTD formulations. In addition, the bilinear transformation (BT) is incorporated into modified Lorentz-based FDTD formulations and it will be shown that the utilization of the BT can lead to better performance in terms of numerical stability and numerical accuracy.

Traditionally, the VSIEs are solved by the method of moments (MoM) with Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) and Schaubert-Wilton-Glisson (SWG) basis functions. We develop a hybrid method to discretize the VSIEs where the surface integral equation (SIE) for the conducting part is discretized by the standard MoM, while the volume integral equations (VIEs) for the penetrable part are discretized by a point-matching scheme (PMS). The PMS can use unstructured or nonconforming meshes and make the integral kernels of VIEs be free of material parameters. Also, the VIEs can result in well-conditioned system matrices because they are the second kind of integral equations. For electrically large or complex problems with multiscale structures, we unite the hybrid method with the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) to accelerate the solutions. Since the MLFMA is sensitive to the conditioning of system matrices which the multiscale feature will deteriorate and is tedious to implement, using the VIEs can ameliorate the conditioning of system matrices and using the PMS can facilitate the implementation of MLFMA.

Due to the rotationally symmetrical property, the electromagnetic currents on the BoRs and the equivalence spheres (ESs) are all expanded by the basis functions of BoR. In this way, the self-action and the interaction can be both calculated by using the method of moment for BoR (BoR-MoM). With the repeatability fully used, the self-action for the BoRs with the same size just needs to be calculated once. Moreover, the interaction can also be got once when the size and relative displacement vector of their corresponding ESs are the same. Since these self-action/interaction matrices are constructed in mutually orthogonal Fourier modes, the entire problem is eventually solved by a couple of small matrix equations independently. As a result, the SEPA-CBoR method can greatly save the memory requirement and solution time.
