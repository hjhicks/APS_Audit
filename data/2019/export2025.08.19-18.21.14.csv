The antenna system consists of a parabolic reflector and a dual-beam feed. For the dual-beam feed, two identical Ku-band feed elements are arranged side by side to generate two beams toward the reflector. The two beams are substantially nonoverlapping. The feed element is composed of a dielectric rod, a square waveguide, and an ortho-mode transducer. The dielectric rod is effective in reducing the beamwidth of the feed and providing more tapered illumination on the reflector in order to increase the antenna gain. Moreover, the developed antenna is able to produce two independent beams with the vertical and horizontal polarizations. The antenna was fabricated and tested with good agreement between the simulation and measurement results. The measured voltage standing wave ratios of the four feed ports are less than 1.5:1, and the beam separation angle is not more than 0.7° or about one time half-power beamwidth, and the antenna gain is higher than 45 dBi over the operating band from 14.5 to 15.35 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2882593","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601338); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JB180207); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8542705","Angular diversity;dual beam;dual polarization;high gain;offset reflector antenna","Reflector antennas;Dielectrics;Antenna feeds;Metals;Transducers;Electromagnetic waveguides","","32","","21","IEEE","21 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna consists of a ground, a stacked patch, and a driven patch fed by four centrally symmetric ports. Based on the S-parameter analysis of the multiport antenna, six polarization states (0°, 90°, 45° linear polarization, and left-handed and right-handed circular polarization) with stable reflection coefficients and radiation pattern can be realized by controlling the input phases of four ports. In this way, it is not necessary to use extra feeding network to realize the multiple polarization states. Moreover, in addition to radiating electromagnetic energy just like conventional antennas, the proposed multiport antenna can also realize on-antenna power combining without the need of power combiner. As a result, the losses and size caused by extra power combiner and feeding network can be avoided. For verification, the four-port patch antennas in different polarization states are designed and compared.

The decoupling mechanism is illustrated by investigating the electric-field (E-field) and magnetic-field (H-field) distributions. The E-field distributions indicate that the NFRs above the patches serve as coupling-mode transducers to produce an orthogonal coupling mode at the desired resonance, leading to high port isolation between the patches. The H-field distributions demonstrate that the H-fields in the substrate are confined within the excited element, leading to the effective suppression of antenna mutual coupling. The NFR can be easily applied to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas having multiple patch elements. Three practical decoupling examples are demonstrated and the simulation and measurement results show that impedance matching for each antenna port and isolation of better than 20 dB are achieved for all these examples using the NFRs. Moreover, for the H-plane and E-plane decoupling of wideband two-port MIMO antennas, wide decoupled impedance bandwidths of 6.1% and 5.8% are obtained, respectively.

The Rogers ULTRALAM (εr = 2.9 and tanδ = 0.0025) liquid crystalline polymer material with 0.1 mm thickness is used as both the substrate and superstrate. By employing the shorting strategy, a flower-shape radiating patch, and open-ended slots in the ground plane, the total volume of the proposed antenna is confined to 7 × 7.2 × 0.2 mm3. In a homogeneous skin phantom, the presented antenna has a maximum gain of -28.44 and -25.65 dBi at 928 MHz and 2.45 GHz, respectively. The calculated maximum specific absorption rate values are in the safe limit and satisfy the IEEE C95.1-1999 and C95.1-2005 safety guidelines. The design, optimization, and analysis of the suggested antenna are performed using the finite difference time-domain- and finite-element method-based simulators. The results suggest that the flower-shape antenna exhibits fairly omnidirectional radiation patterns; therefore, it can be used for gastro applications and skin implantations. Through wireless communication link, we validated that at both frequencies (928 MHz and 2.45 GHz), 7 Kb/s and 78 Mb/s of data can be transmitted easily over more than 6 and 1.5 m, respectively.

The proposed MSA consists of 7 × 10 square metasurface cells and is fed by a completely symmetrical controllable network, which includes three dumbbell-shaped coupling slots etched on the ground and two-port stepped impedance line beneath the ground. The network can flexibly control the magnitude and phase of the coupling energy from the feeding line to the radiated metasurface cells via the slots, so as to realize two desired symmetrical beams. Owing to good directional radiation of the MSA, the beams of the proposed MSA exhibit better front-to-back ratio, higher gain, and higher channel isolation than those of traditional traveling-wave slot antennas. Moreover, benefiting from the controllable feeding mechanism, impedance matching, sidelobe suppression, and isolation of the ports can be further improved. Consequently, the two achieved beams are, respectively, oriented at ±30° in azimuth plane with 10 dB beamwidth of about 120°, high-peak gains of 12.8 dBi and cross level at two beams junction of about -10 dB; meanwhile, the isolation of the two ports is over 15 dB within the band of interests (5.23 and 5.40 GHz). For demonstration of the design strategy, one 1 × 2 dual-beam MSA array with gain of 14.8 dBi and similar beam performance is designed and fabricated.

The proposed antenna is enabled by an engineered MS-based artificial ground that supports simultaneous dual-band functionality and dual-CP unidirectional radiation. The artificial ground is a highly truncated dual-layer MS containing an array of 2 × 2 unit cells. Each unit cell is comprised by a patch and a complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) printed on the top and bottom surfaces of the substrate, respectively. A printed feeding monopole antenna is integrated with the MS to form a low-profile dual-band dualCP antenna with a thickness of 0.04λ0, where λ0 is the free-space wavelength at the first operational band. A dispersion analysis of the unit cell is carried out both analytically and numerically to illustrate the working principle of the proposed antenna. This reveals that the bianisotropic response and the orientation of the CSRRs jointly provide distinct dispersion behavior along two orthogonal directions of the dual-layer MS, enabling the desired dual-band dual-CP radiation. Moreover, the CSRRs also facilitate antenna miniaturization, yielding an overall footprint of only 0.33λ0 × 0.33λ0.

The idea is to make the antenna element as small as possible, so that more elements can be arranged within the prescribed aperture area to maximize Gep of the UWB system. On the other hand, the antenna element should match the pulse excitation. This means that in the frequency domain, the working band of the antenna element should cover the spectrum of the radiated pulse, and in the time domain, critical parameters of the radiated field (e.g., rise time of the monopolar pulse) should not be distorted, and those can be the principles for the UWB antenna to match the pulsed excitation, based on which the minimum size of the antenna element can be determined. With this method, a four-element combined antenna array is designed. Also, an impedance transformer and power divider are designed to feed the antenna array. Also, a big combined antenna is developed with the same aperture dimensions (30 cm × 30 cm) as the antenna array. Then, the performances of the antenna array and the big antenna are measured and compared. Compared with the big antenna, Gep of the antenna array is 21% higher under the applied excitation, which indicates that the proposed method can significantly improve Gep of the UWB system within the prescribed aperture area. Finally, the antenna array is furthermore optimized by adjusting the distances between the elements, and Gep is improved by another 11%, the total improvement is 33%, and the corresponding effective potential gain is 1.49.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2882615","International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China(grant numbers:2013DFR70610); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8542697","Antenna array;aperture;combined antenna;compact;effective potential gain;ultra-wideband (UWB)","Antenna arrays;Ultra wideband antennas;Aperture antennas;Finite element analysis;Frequency-domain analysis","","25","","25","IEEE","21 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A cross-shaped conductor fed by two pairs of capacity coupling feeding probes is utilized to drive the dual-polarized magnetic dipole antenna.

The decrease in directivity associated with mutual coupling effects, the so-called element-gain paradox, can be explained by the overlap of the element effective area shapes. The critical element spacing for the element-gain paradox effect can be predicted from the effective area shape for a single isolated array element.

The brute-force computation of a DFT requires O(N2) multiplications while an FFT provides the same computation at O(N log N) multiplications. The digital chip area and power consumption of the DFT computation are still dominated by the multipliers required by the FFT used. In this paper, an approximation to the 16-point DFT is proposed which maintains mathematical properties close to the ideal 16-point DFT to obtain 16 RF beams by computing an approximate spatial DFT in every clock cycle at significantly lower area and power in the digital realization.

Meanwhile, the sidelobe level (SLL) of the array would also increase due to the unavoidable errors. The above-described factors would dramatically decrease the performance of radar in the adaptive suppression of interference. To increase the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of a radar system, this paper presents an approach to design the low SLL ΣA-patterns where the nulls of the A-pattern, excluding the central null, are always aligned with those of the Σ-pattern in the presence of errors. Two schemes are addressed to obtain the covariance matrix for null-alignment constraint, which is exploited to force nulling in desired angles accordingly. In the sequel, the matrix tapering method is adopted to broaden the nulls and enhance the robustness for the possible errors.

The formulations are structured upon the recently formulated “beam-frame” theorem that establishes these phase-space beam sets as frame sets everywhere in the propagation domain and not only over the aperture plane as in previous formulations. The expansion coefficients are obtained by projecting the source distributions over the dual beam-frame sets that have essentially the same structure as the basic sets.

This provides an important connection between various modal interaction phenomena known in guided-wave structures with recent interesting effects observed in quantum mechanics, photonics, and metamaterials systems described in terms of the algebraic EPD formalism. Since bifurcation theory involves only eigenvalues, we also establish the connection to the linear-algebra point of view by casting the system eigenvectors in terms of eigenvalues, analytically showing that the coalescence of two eigenvalues results automatically in the coalescence of the two respective eigenvectors. Therefore, for the studied two-coupled transmission-line problem, the eigenvalue degeneracy explicitly implies an EPD.

The FSR is composed of a resistive sheet and a bandpass frequency-selective surface (FSS). The unit cell of the resistive sheet is a resistor-loaded hexagonal metallic loop, each side of which is inserted with a circular spiral resonator (CSR) in the center. The CSR is equivalent to a parallel LC circuit that has a high inductance and low parasitic capacitance. At a high frequency of 10 GHz, the CSR resonates to be infinite impedance, around which a 0.5 dB transmission band of 8.68-11.34 GHz is produced. The bandpass FSS is a triple-layer FSS in which two layers of identical hexagonal patches are coupled through a layer of hexagonal aperture; it has a fast rolloff 0.5 dB transmission band of 8.2-11.33 GHz, which almost coincides with that of the resistive sheet. The 1 dB transmission band of the FSR by placing the resistive sheet on the bandpass FSS is 8.3-11.07 GHz. At low frequency, the FSR performs as an absorber, and the 10 dB absorption band is 2.4-7.1 GHz. In addition, due to its tiny physical sizes of only 1.2 mm × 1.6 mm, the CSR can be viewed as a lumped element circuit with a high inductance, in which the parallel resonance is almost independent to the incident angle.

One consequence of multiscale features is locally dense discretization, which leads to low-frequency breakdown and requires nonuniform trees. To the authors' knowledge, the literature on parallel MLFMA for such multiscale distributions capable of arbitrary accuracy is sparse; this paper aims to fill this niche.

In this paper, we focus on challenging these two difficulties in the impedance boundary half-space, which is a proper model for common air-lossy media half-space. Based on the Laplace transformation, we first propose an alternative exact image representation for the Sommerfeld integral in half-space Green's function. In addition to its fast and absolute convergence property, this new exact image version does not contain any singularities and interprets the Sommerfeld integral as an integral over real image line. Furthermore, this representation allows a rigorous fast multipole expansion (FME), and thus it can be applied to the development of fast multipole solver with controllable precision. However, this exact image representation is not valid for the all Sommerfeld integrals in half-space Green's function. Therefore, a more generalized single mirror image representation, also exact and computationally efficient, is then presented. The strength of the mirror image is obtained through Weyl's method and steep descent path approach.

The closed-form Hankel transform of the Fourier-Bessel basis functions (FBBFs) allows one to use a spectral domain formulation in the method-of-moments (MoM) solution of the EFIE. Moreover, these basis functions are fully orthogonal, which implies that they are able to represent the global evolution of the current distribution in a compact form. FBBFs also present a better filtering capability of their spectrum compared to other well-known orthogonal families such as the Zernike functions. The obtained MoM matrix is sparse and compact, and it is thus very well-conditioned and can be efficiently computed and inverted. The numerical results based on the proposed decomposition are presented and compared with those based on the use of the Gaussian ring basis functions and with the full-wave analysis of MTS antennas implemented with small printed elements.

The approach is based on applying the surface divergence theorem twice, once on the source and once on the test domain. When the integrations are reordered as two outer contour integrals plus two inner radial integrals, the initial radial integrations provide significant smoothing of the underlying singular integrands.

In particular, it is noted that the transverse spectrum of the field can possess singularities. These singularities are spectrally filtered by the finite size of the scan plane resulting in a “muting” effect that must be accounted for in the data processing.

In this paper, novel channel emulation techniques by using RVC are introduced to enhance the flexibility in controlling the emulated time and frequency dispersions of the channels. Surface acoustic wave delay lines and power controllers (i.e., amplifiers and attenuators) are used to add degrees of freedom for manipulating the power delay profile during delay spread emulation. This technique also overcomes the challenge of achieving higher delay spread values with benchtop-sized RVC.

These differentially driven feedlines are utilized to coupled feed the irregular patch through a small gap, which has distinguished feature compared with other designs. It turns out that a resonance at 3.55 GHz is generated. Then, an annulus is set above the main radiator to compensate the inductive component induced by the main radiator and generate the other resonant point. As a result, the dual-polarized antenna could work from 3.3 to 3.6 GHz with the extremely compact size of 0.29λ0 × 0.29λ0 × 0.06λ0. (λ0 is the free-space wavelength at 3.45 GHz.)

The combination of the two orthogonal dipoles leads to a quasi-isotropic radiation pattern, with gain deviation as low as 5.8 dB in the 360° full space. To integrate the filtering function, the microstrip feed-line and the ground plane are turned upside down, and further two stubs with different lengths are used together to excite the DR.

Such a wave, also referred to as “tapered wave,” provides concentrated power density near the scattering center and decays rapidly to negligible level before reaching the edge for most of the incident angles. The resulting scattered intensities need to be normalized by the tapered incident power, to quantitatively predict the radar cross section, which is compatible to the far-zone plane wave results from measurements and analytical solutions. Conventionally, the incident power of tapered wave has been computed numerically by summing up the scattered fields of a flat surface over all azimuth angles, which is tedious and inefficient. In this communication, an exact expression of the incident power is analytically elaborated as an onefold definite integral of zero to one. The binomial expansion of this analytical method is also outlined, and the validation data show good agreement between the analytical solution and numerical results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2884851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8558566","Incident power;normalization;radar cross section (RCS);scattering;tapered wave","Surface waves;Scattering;Diffraction;Radar cross-sections;Antennas;Density measurement;Power system measurements","","1","","6","IEEE","4 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed array antenna is based on a multilayer printed circuit board structure containing two dielectric substrates and four copper cladding layers. The radiating elements, which consist of slim rectangular patches with surrounding U-shaped parasitic patches, are located on the top layer. Every four radiation elements are grouped together as a 2 × 2 subarray and fed by a microstrip power divider on the next copper layer through metalized blind vias. Four such subarrays are corporate-fed by an SIW feeding network underneath. The design process and analysis of the array antenna are discussed. A prototype of the proposed array antenna is fabricated and measured, showing a good agreement between the simulation and measurement, thus validating the correctness of the design. The measured results indicate that the proposed array antenna exhibits a wide |S11| <; -10 dB bandwidth of 17.7%, i.e., 25.3-30.2 GHz, a peak gain of 16.4 dBi, a high radiation efficiency above 80%, and a good orthogonal polarization discrimination of higher than 30 dB. In addition, the use of low-profile substrate in the SIW feeding network makes this array antenna easier to be integrated directly with millimeter-wave frontend integrated circuits. The demonstrated array antenna can be a good candidate for various Ka-band wireless applications, such as 5G, satellite communications and so on.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2883561","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61627801); National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0101000); Southeast University(grant numbers:YBJJ1813); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8548600","Ka-band;multilayer printed circuit board (PCB);substrate integrated waveguide (SIW);wideband array antenna","Antenna feeds;Microstrip antenna arrays;Millimeter wave communication;Substrates;Broadband antennas;Microstrip","","79","","32","IEEE","27 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Bezier curves are used to describe the aperture amplitude distributions. By optimizing the coordinates of the associated Bezier points, an aperture distribution yielding the maximum beam collection efficiency (BCE) can be achieved. Moreover, edge tapers can be easily controlled by the Bezier curves. The proposed method shows its effectiveness from carrying out extensive numerical experiments on different Fresnel parameters as well as edge taper constraints. The results show that larger aperture power coefficients obtain with a little sacrifice of BCEs when larger edge taper constraints are considered. Besides, the peak lobe irradiated outside the rectenna can be suppressed as well.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2884850","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51490660); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2018JM5058); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8558547","Aperture illumination;aperture power coefficient (APC);beam collection efficiency (BCE);Bezier curve;microwave wireless power transmission (MWPT);space solar power satellites (SSPSs);wireless power transmission","Transmitting antennas;Rectennas;Microwave antennas;Aperture antennas;Lighting","","16","","28","IEEE","4 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A signal is mixed with an auxiliary signal and sent into an enclosed cavity. The strongly distorted signal transmitted through the cavity is then sent to a receiver, where it is time reversed and sent to a second enclosed metallic cavity that is strictly identical to the first one. As a result, the waveform of the initial signal is reconstructed at a point of the second cavity that is equivalent to the point of the first cavity due to the spatial and temporal focusing. Using the mechanism, secure wireless data transmission is carried out. Finally, the impact of the size of the cavity on intersymbol interference and the frequency dispersion caused by frequency selective fading are discussed. Such a communication system ensures a high level of security.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2885239","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601087,61331007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8561174","Multipath effect;temporal and spatial focusing;time reversal;wave packet","Cavity resonators;Focusing;Correlation;Distortion;Eavesdropping;Antennas;Wireless communication","","10","","28","IEEE","5 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
