The proposed ME-dipole antenna consists of four shorted patches, in which the magnetic dipole mode is formed by the slot-aperture between patches. Therefore, the height of the antenna is not limited to 0.25λc, but can be as low as 0.11λc. By symmetrically inserting four slots on the patches, a wide impedance bandwidth is obtained, and a controllable radiation null is generated at the upper band-edge to enhance the out-of-band suppression level. On the other hand, by properly designing the length of the feeding lines, another controllable radiation null and its second harmonic null are generated on each side of the passband, improving the selectivity and the suppression level of both the lower and upper stopbands without degrading the in-band performance. The measured results show that the prototype has a -15 dB impedance bandwidth of 27.6%, covering the specific 5G NR band n65 (3.3-4.2 GHz).

According to the mode analysis, undesired higher-order modes can be effectively suppressed by selecting a proper length ratio of two sides of the patch and the feeding position, thus realizing a wide upper stopband. To further enhance the filtering response, another two simple filtering structures loaded on the patch antenna are also proposed. First, a split-ring-shaped slot is etched on the patch to generate a radiation null at the lower-band edge for improving skirt selectivity. Second, a U-shaped strip is etched underneath the patch and connected with the feeding probe, which can introduce another null at the upper band edge. As a result, a high suppression level of 23 dB in lower and upper stopbands can be realized, respectively, for the proposed filtering antenna, while the upper stopband can extend up to 2.3 f0(f0 is the center frequency of the antenna). Furthermore, wide passband response can also be achieved by the extra in-band resonances existing in the slot and the strip. A filtering antenna prototype is fabricated and measured for demonstration. Good agreements between the simulated and the measured results are observed, indicating a large impedance bandwidth of 22.6%, high antenna efficiency of 95.6%, and an average gain of about 7.4 dBi. Compared with the reported filtering antennas, the proposed filtering antenna can achieve better wideband filtering response but with a simpler configuration.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2922770","Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program(grant numbers:2017ZT07X032); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571231,61601224,61822110); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20160844); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741147","Filtering antenna;out-of-band suppression level;patch antenna;radiation null;wideband","Patch antennas;Resonant frequency;Slot antennas;Antenna measurements;Band-pass filters","","113","","29","IEEE","19 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A major factor that limits the functionality of CubeSats is the absence of high-gain antennas (HGAs) that can sustain a high data-rate link for communications or provide the required spatial resolution for remote sensing. In this work, we discuss the development of one of the largest apertures at Ka-band for CubeSats-a 1 m mesh deployable offset reflector antenna, with a stowed volume of 3U (10× 10 × 30 cm3)-to enable precipitation radars that can achieve the required spatial resolution while meeting the stringent mechanical constraints posed by the small CubeSat volume. We detail the critical aspects of this antenna design, including RF characterization, antenna fabrication, and measurement. We also describe a novel deployment mechanism that facilitates the packaging of such a large aperture in a small volume. The antenna demonstrated a measured efficiency of 60%, with a half-power beamwidth of 0.60° at 35.75 GHz. The cost reduction afforded by CubeSats makes launching a constellation of such radar based CubeSats practical, allowing higher temporal sampling rates, which is essential for the observation of weather processes with a short-time evolution.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2920223","National Aeronautics and Space Administration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732657","CubeSat;deployable antenna;Earth Science;high-gain antenna (HGA);horn;mesh reflectors;radar;reflector antenna;remote sensing;telecommunication;National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)","Radar antennas;CubeSat;Antenna measurements;Feeds;Spaceborne radar","","47","","29","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Another set of shorting pins are fixed symmetrically along the diagonal of the square patch for directivity and null depth enhancement. To achieve continuous pattern reconfiguration, varactors are connected with the edge-shorting pins to provide continuously tunable phase difference.

Different from its conventional second higher-order leaky-mode counterpart with two symmetric radiation beams, the proposed antenna with an array of I-shaped slots radiates only one main radiation beam at the cross-sectional center plane. By introducing a transversally loaded slot array along the microstrip line, the cross-polarization of the antenna can be largely enhanced, while a longitudinally loaded slot array interrupts the current flow and thus effectively reduces the original two radiation beams. Subsequently, an array of I-shaped slots, including transversal- and longitudinal-slot portions, is etched on the strip conductor and its unique characteristics are then analyzed to obtain a single main radiation beam in the center plane. To validate this proposal, a prototype of single main beam LWA with second higher-order mode is designed, implemented, and fabricated. Owing to larger leakage constant, the LWA presented in this paper radiates higher power within a shorter length in terms of guided wavelength, resulting in a higher gain. The measured results show a beam-scanning capability from 20° to 55° as the frequency varies from 5.1 to 4.6 GHz, while the maximum gain of 14.6 dBi is achieved at 4.9 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2920260","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61721001,61622106,61571468); Universidade de Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00007-FST,MYRG2018-00073-FST,CPG2017-00028-FST); Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciências e da Tecnologia(grant numbers:091/2016/A2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732667","I-shaped slot array;microstrip leaky-wave antenna (LWA);second higher-order mode;single main beam radiation","Microstrip;Microstrip antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Microstrip antennas;Leaky wave antennas;Loading;Slot antennas","","26","","40","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This strategy reduces the volume and weight of the antenna system, which is an especially appealing characteristic in satellite antennas. Each isolated evanescent-mode filter ends in a small-size aperture and is designed following a novel synthesis procedure. Next, the radiating elements are combined, and the resulting array is analyzed as a multiplexer from the input ports to the free-space region, thus accounting for all mutual couplings between different apertures.

Instead of focusing the radiation at a single focal point, which results in an ellipsoidal reflector, this new reflector antenna application concept designates a finite zone, especially a finite curved surface, for NFF illumination. This finite zone may consist of several subzones for multi-NFF radiation. The design concept employs equal path lengths of wave propagation from the feed's phase center toward the focal zone via reflections from the reflector's surface in a one-to-one correspondence, which results in a confluence of reflection points found from a set of ellipsoidal surfaces. Based on a definition of the mapping mechanism to extract the reflection points to form the reflector, the field can be properly focused in the target zone by the concept of geometric optics (GO). In this paper, the basic theoretical concept is first summarized with a design equation developed for easy implementation. The focus property is demonstrated by a time-domain physical optics (TD-PO) analysis of spherical wave illumination with a transient-step field behavior to show the focusing responses of electromagnetic scattering from the reflector. The focusing characteristics of the frequency domain (FD) are also shown by PO simulation at 20 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2922785","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:MOST-107-2218-E-002-050); National Taiwan University(grant numbers:108L893702); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741151","Near-field focus (NFF) radiation;reflector antenna;time-domain physical optics (TD-PO)","Reflection;Reflector antennas;Noise measurement;Feeds;Optical surface waves;Apertures;Phased arrays","","3","","23","IEEE","19 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the analysis of the impedance matrix for the equivalent microwave network, the required WAIM can be implemented with such minified mutual impedance.

The proposed metasurface exhibits an effective surface inductance that is extended to evanescent waves with large transverse wavenumber using coiled wires. Metasurfaces with inductive response over a wide spatial spectrum can be used for the realization of hyperbolic metamaterials (HMs) at microwave frequencies. Stacking such inductive metasurfaces separated by thin dielectric spacers leads to a negative real part of the in-plane, effective dielectric permittivity, and thus, to hyperbolic wavevector dispersion at microwave frequencies. We establish the requirements for such hyperbolic dispersion condition using arrays of coiled wires, also accounting for losses. We show that the negative in-plane real part of dielectric permittivity stretches up to transverse wavenumbers that are several times larger than the free-space wavenumber, over a broad frequency bandwidth.

High-efficiency transmission based on SSPP modes coupling can be achieved below the cut-off frequency using the metallic fishbone structure (MFS). As the composed blade length is varied, the dispersion of the SSPP mediated on the MFS keeps almost unchanged in the low-frequency band, while has an obvious change in the high-frequency band. Therefore, the FSS with transmission and scattering deflection can be achieved by a reflection-type coding metamaterial using the MFS. To verify this idea, the FSS was simulated, fabricated, and measured. Under linearly polarized wave normal incidence, the transmissivity of the FSS exceeds -0.8 dB below the frequency f = 9.5 GHz. In the stopband, the radar cross section (RCS) reduction is higher than 10 dB from 14.4 to 18.0 GHz, which results from the anomalous reflection due to the 1 bit 0101/1010 coding sequence.

The conceptual idea is achieved by discretizing the lenslet into  $N(N>1)$  concentric fragments and perform high-order TO in each fragment with different values of azimuthal  $s$  parameter — an unconstrained parameter that defines the operation point of the nanofocusing device. To highlight the superior performance of using the FHTO in the nanofocusing versus the unitary  $(N=1)$  high-order TO (UHTO), both methods are adopted to design the hyperbolic lenslet. The numerical simulation results show that the FHTO (e.g.,  $N\to \infty $  and  $N = 5$ ) exhibits superior focusing performance compared with the UHTO. For example, the performance of the FHTO is better than that of the UHTO by ~2.5 (5.3) times in spectral resolution (power throughput). Remarkably, even the manufacturable lenslet designed using FHTO-approach with realizable number of metal-dielectric binary layers (five pairs) demonstrates superior performance than the UHTO.

Two topologies comprising lossy inductive or capacitive layers are investigated to realize tunable microwave absorbers. The plasma is sustained by a sinusoidal radio frequency (RF) voltage source coupled directly through the walls of the plasma-shells. These active frequency-selective absorbers are analyzed using a transmission line approach to provide the working principle and its frequency tuning capability. By varying the voltage of the sustainer, the plasma can be modeled as a lossy, variable, frequency-dependent inductor, providing a dynamic tuning response of the absorption spectral band.

Basis functions accounting for edge singularities are used in the approximation of the electric/magnetic current density on the patches/apertures, which enables a fast convergence of MoM with respect to the number of basis functions. Since the 2-D Fourier transforms of the basis functions cannot be obtained in closed-form, these Fourier transforms are efficiently computed by means of the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) algorithm. Results have been obtained for frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs), and for the elements used in the design of both reflectarray and metasurface antennas.

These gels can be tailored to control the amount of liquid they embed so that they can imitate different body tissues in a wide bandwidth (2-26.5 GHz), which includes most of the current mobile communication and medical bands.

This incident field exhibits a transient-step field response and can be the radiation from a relatively arbitrary EM source located at any place. The mechanism is interpreted by considering an equal time-delay curved aperture (ETDCA) where a set of EM equivalent current sources are defined to radiate the scattering field. The transient responses at any instant time are then found by considering the effects of equal net time-delay in propagation when the incident wave propagates to the field point via EM scattering from the scatterer. A contributing contour in the radiation integral of the equivalent currents define on the ETDCA by its intersection with a time-varying equal path-length sphere defined by the field point is therefore extracted to reduce the surface integral into a line one.

Each edge is characterized by an edge transfer function accounting for the attenuation, delay spread, and the phase shift on the edge. In this contribution, we extend this modeling formalism to polarized channels by incorporating depolarization effects into the edge transfer functions and hence, the channel transfer matrix. We derive closed form expressions for the polarimetric power delay spectrum and cross-polarization ratio of the indoor channel. The expressions are derived considering average signal propagation in a graph and relate these statistics to model parameters, thereby providing a useful approach to investigate the averaged effect of these parameters on the channel statistics. Furthermore, we present a procedure for calibrating the model based on method of moments.

The focusing is done in the near-field region by axially moving the subreflector from the focal point. It is observed that the subreflector position has to shift approximately 11 wavelengths along the axis to create the focus at the required location. The focused antenna gain is 46 dBi, while the 3 dB focus width and depth of the designed antenna is ~4 mm and 10 cm, respectively.

To minimize the thickness of the polarizer, the properties of the artificial anisotropic material (AAM) for generating CP wave are discussed analytically. Minimal polarizer thickness and the corresponding component ratio are provided mathematically. In comparison with other approaches, the proposed design achieves a relatively high-gain and wideband performance with a minimal thickness. The antenna exhibits a wide impedance bandwidth of more than 39% (VSWR <; 2) from 55 to 82 GHz and a wide axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of more than 32% (AR <; 3 dB) from 56 to 77 GHz. The average gain is 17 dBic. Good unidirectional radiation characteristics are achieved with low fabrication cost.

By using the λ/4 slot radiator with its opened terminal at one side, the endfire-radiated fields of the slot antenna is initially formed with compact dimension and endfire radiation. After that, the λ/4 slot radiator with two distinctive portions of different slot widths is presented and investigated. The results demonstrate that the resonant frequencies of the first two odd-order modes could be progressively reallocated in proximity to each other as the length and width ratios of these two portions are properly selected. Thus, the bandwidth in input impedance of the entire differentially fed slot antenna could be significantly improved under operation of dual-resonant modes. Next, an extra microstrip-line resonator is introduced in the feeding part so as to produce a third resonant mode and improve its frequency selectivity in the wide operating band. To validate these predicted performances, a filtering slot antenna operating from 3.33 to 4.50 GHz is in final fabricated and tested. The measured results exhibit good impedance matching property, flat radiation gain of about 5 dBi, and improved endfire radiation characteristic with the front-to-back ratio (FBR) better than 9.0 dB in the operating band.

A cornerstone of the antenna element design is its simplicity, which counteracts the mobility issues of physically large and unavoidably bulky ground-based VHF radar systems. The multi-port element introduces a third dimension in the otherwise planar array configuration. Using a nonlinear optimization scheme to realize a set of matching networks for the element, the active loading from surrounding elements in the array environment is suppressed resulting in a nondistorted embedded element pattern. The element is compared to the resembling Yagi-Uda design in terms of standard multi-port and radar metrics. The simulated results indicate that the element enables a significant suppression of grating lobes when beam steering within a limited angular sector, which in turn has an overall positive impact on the array performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2925967","Försvarsmakten; Swedish Defence Materiel Administration; Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758466","3-D array;grating lobe;multi-port;nonlinear optimization;phased array;radar;very high frequency (VHF)","Routing;Servers;Topology;Network topology;Computer architecture;Bandwidth;Quality of service","","3","","14","IEEE","9 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, MAA is optimized for maximum forward gain. Finally, the input impedances of the elements of the optimized MAA and the element spacing are recorded. In the second phase, the MFN is considered to terminate at lumped loads with values equal to the input impedances of the respective elements of the optimized MAA and is then optimized to achieve low standing wave ratio, high power efficiency, and output currents equal to those applied in the first phase by the current sources. All optimizations are performed with an improved particle swarm optimization variant in conjunction with CST. In the third phase, the optimized MFN is attached to MAA and is evaluated with CST.

With the suitable arrangement of particles on metasurfaces, anomalous reflection and refraction have been observed in wide frequency ranges. To completely control the propagation of EM waves, both phase and amplitude profiles are required in some applications. Herein, we propose a new type of metasurface with both phase and amplitude modulations, which is composed of C-shaped particles and can generate and control multiple beams using amplitude and phase responses simultaneously. An addition theorem of complex reflection coefficients is presented to acquire various states of multiple beams reflected from designed metasurfaces. Meanwhile, the intensities of multiple beams can be separately modulated as desired benefitting from the independent controls of phase and amplitude profiles. All the experimental results have good agreements with the numerical simulations. The presented method opens a new way to form and manipulate multiple beams using metasurfaces, which can find potential applications in beam shaping, radar detection systems, and high-quality holography.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2925289","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFA0700201,2017YFA0700202,2017YFA0700203); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631007,61571117,61501112,61501117,61522106,61731010,61735010,61722106,61701107,61701108); 111 Project(grant numbers:111-2-05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753713","Amplitude and phase modulations;complex reflection-coefficient addition;metasurface;multiple beams","Particle beams;Metamaterials;Scattering;Microwave communication;Antennas;Microwave imaging","","153","","22","IEEE","2 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
