The proposed antenna is based on a combination of the Fabry-Perot cavity (FPC) and sequential feeding technique. The purpose of this antenna is to produce CP with high directive gain over a wide bandwidth while preserving low RCS. The principle of the FPC and resonance is achieved by applying one frequency selective surface (FSS) metasurface. A microstrip slot array operating at the Ka-band, excited by a sequentially rotated feeding network, is designed and fabricated. It is indicated that all the merits mentioned above can be obtained over a broad frequency band by designing a suitable FSS metasurface and modifying the feeding lengths to adjust desirable phase. RCS reduction is realized by 180° ±37° reflection phase variations between adjacent FSS unit cells on the metasurface. The experimental results show that the gain of the antenna with the metasurface is at least 7 dB greater than that of the primary antenna with a peak value approximately 20 dB at 28.5 GHz. In addition, bandwidths of 3-dB gain, impedance (|S11| ≤ -10 dB), and axial ratio ≤3 dB are ranged from 27.5 to 33.5 GHz (19.7%), 26.7 to 34.2 GHz (24.6%), and 26.8 to 33.1 GHz (21%), respectively.

The MTS is defined on a circular domain and is represented as a continuous sheet transition impedance boundary condition (IBC) on the top of a grounded substrate. The proposed method relies on an entire-domain discretization of the electric field integral equation (EFIE). Via the dyadic Green's function of the grounded substrate, the desired radiation pattern is translated into the visible part of the surface current spectrum, decomposed into entire-domain and orthogonal basis functions, while the invisible part of the spectrum stems from the solution of the unmodulated sheet problem. The EFIE is then inverted to obtain the sheet impedance, which is constrained to be anti-Hermitian, as required for implementation with lossless patches. The efficiency of the method relies on the precomputation of the reaction integrals between three functions: basis functions for currents and impedances and testing functions for fields. The formulation is presented first for the scalar (isotropic) MTS case and then generalized to the tensorial (anisotropic) MTSs. Several radiation patterns are presented and designed successfully.

Different from the traditional wideband slot antennas with multiple resonant modes, the proposed design of this paper utilizes the traveling-wave mode. By using a slotline-CPW transition as the convertor, which connects a slotline and four open slots, the forward wave in the slot has small reflection. The working mode keeps stable at different frequencies, i.e., operating in the traveling-wave mode. As a result, both wide bandwidth and stable radiation patterns are achieved with inherent characteristic of traveling-wave mode. The proposed antenna occupies a small area and the slot width is narrow, which make it suitable to be mounted on the edge of metallic surface for wireless devices.

Two polarization ridged waveguide linear arrays combine to obtain dual-polarized radiation with cross-polarization levels under −43 dB in wide angles. To extend the bandwidth of the array, each  $1 \times 16$ -element linear array is separated into two  $1 \times 8$ -element arrays, which are fed by a two-way ridged waveguide divider via H-shaped slot couplings.

To demonstrate the influence of antenna structures and excitations on the CM and SM, three antennas are analyzed and only a few modes are required to achieve a good accuracy.

We first derive a rigorous analytical solution for the wave scattering from general ST permittivity- and permeability-modulated (STP&PM) slabs. The analytical solution considers the most general form of spatiotemporal variation and wave incidence, i.e., oblique incidence and scattering from time-periodic spatially aperiodic/periodic STP&PM slabs. The spatial aperiodicity may be utilized for further spectrum engineering and suppression of undesired STHs. Next, it will be shown that an equilibrated ST refractive-index-modulated slab with equal permittivity and permeability modulation strengths exhibits highly enhanced nonreciprocity. The FDTD numerical simulation of general STM slabs is presented, providing extra leverage for the analyses of wave propagation and scattering in such media. We show that oblique incidence to an STM slab yields nonreciprocal spatial decomposition of generated STHs.

The appealing feature of the proposed technique is that by representing the generalized Snell-Descartes' law of reflection in the form of array factor, it unifies the two most widely studied and well-established modern RCS-reduction methods: checkerboard metasurfaces and gradient index metasurfaces. More importantly, it refines the concepts of both of these metasurfaces and overcomes numerous limitations associated with them. It can synthesize the RCS-reduction metasurfaces which can be placed along with almost any existing metasurface, without replacing the original metasurface that may be designed to serve a specific purpose, to reduce its RCS. The proposed technique is fundamentally based on scattering cancellation, and it is validated using artificial magnetic conductor technology for several configurations. Moreover, a phasor representation is developed and implemented for complex configurations to make the synthesis simpler and more insightful.

Information exchange between the background and embedded subdomains are addressed in their shared regions, including four ingredients: field continuity, material difference, perfect electrical conductor (PEC), and port.

The simulator is based on a novel finite-element domain decomposition (FEDD) method for solving the problem of 2-D electromagnetic scattering over 1-D sea surface. This noniterative method partitions the computational domain into a number of overlapping subdomains and solves each domain individually by employing the locally conformal perfectly matched layer (LC-PML) at the truncation boundaries. LC-PML has a unique feature such that it can be applied to irregular domains on the contrary to standard PML methods, and hence inspired the birth of FEDD. The FEDD method is used at each Monte Carlo realization corresponding to a sample from random rough surfaces and decreases the computational load, especially for electrically large problems. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the method are investigated through several simulations. Using the FEDD method, the statistical behavior of the bistatic radar cross section (RCS) is obtained for both the horizontal and vertical polarizations. A special emphasis is given to forward-scattered RCS and the mean reflection coefficient for sea surface, especially at low grazing angles, and it is shown that the simulator produces results in agreement with the Ament and Miller-Brown approximations, and experimental data, proving the reliability of the simulation approach. The results are also compared with the standard finite-element method and method of moments.

Several studies have shown that higher order mode coupling in the waveguide junctions causes errors in the excitation of radiating slots, which in turn result in antenna performance degradation. Efforts to compensate for these effects have to date been restricted to trial-and-error or applying full-wave analysis to an existing design and perturbing the slot dimensions to improve the array performance. In this paper, we present an efficient design approach that accounts for the higher order coupling in the waveguide junctions. Compensation is achieved with the addition of closed-form terms in the expression for the active admittance of the radiating slots straddling the coupling slot in each branch. In addition, we propose amendments to the method for calculation of coupling slot dimensions that accounts for phase differences between scattering parameters of coupling junctions. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is demonstrated by means of two illustrative design examples.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2876118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8493269","Antenna arrays;mutual coupling;radar antennas;slot antennas;waveguide","Couplings;Equivalent circuits;Antenna arrays;Slot antennas;Mathematical model;Waveguide junctions","","13","","19","IEEE","16 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mode generation can be performed with or without sidelobe control, and superdirectivity is avoided by properly selecting the system geometry and regularizing the associated inverse problem. For an individual mode, a continuous aperture source is first determined based on the singular value decomposition of the wave system. This continuous source is subsequently discretized following the construction of a 2-D quadrature rule, which, in the two extreme cases of no and maximum sidelobe suppression, results in an array grid that inherently requires a minimum number of antenna elements. A tradeoff can be made between the adopted array element number and the realized sidelobe level. A method to use a single array with a conserved number of elements to generate and multiplex multiple modes simultaneously is also developed. Full-wave simulations are used to demonstrate the application of the developed theories to arrays of realistic antennas with mutual coupling included. The study shows that, despite their origin in optics, LG modes can be accurately generated in the RF regime, and therefore still play a crucial role in orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based radio.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2874714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8485721","Array synthesis;circular arrays;Laguerre–Gaussian (LG) modes;orbital angular momentum (OAM);OAM-based radio","Laser beams;Antenna arrays;Apertures;Optics;Radio frequency;Multiplexing","","7","","62","IEEE","7 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model is preliminarily tested against joint statistics of rain and cloud attenuations derived from the propagation data set collected in three Italian sites (Spino d'Adda and Milan, in the North, and Tito Scalo, in the South) during the ongoing Alphasat Aldo Paraboni propagation experiment. Although additional experimental data including attenuation induced by rain and clouds are required to further assess the accuracy of the proposed site diversity model, the obtained results, both for short (~20 km) and large (~760 km) site separation distances, are definitely encouraging and suggest that the proposed model is a step towards providing a more comprehensive and accurate prediction of tropospheric impairments for near future high-frequency earth-space systems implementing the site diversity.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2876712","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA8655-13-1-3081); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8496881","Cloud effect;electromagnetic propagation;rain effect;satellite communications (SatComs)","Rain;Clouds;Attenuation;Logic gates;Predictive models;Data models;Correlation coefficient","","10","","27","IEEE","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a dual-mesh method discretizes the object using the Distmesh generator tool, which automatically generates size functions and adapts to the curvature and the feature size of the geometry. Near field scattered data collected from a circular phantom are used to solve the inverse scattering problem using the distorted Born iterative method (DBIM). At every iteration during DBIM, the forward problem is formulated as an underdetermined set of linear equations. Then, the IMATCS method is applied to solve the linear equations. IMATCS is a L2-regularized approach to solve the sparse recovery problem, which improves the robustness of the algorithm. Next, the nondecimated wavelet transform (NDWT) method is applied to transform the nonsparse signal into a sparse signal which acts as an input to the IMATCS process. As a result, the new proposed NDWT based on IMATCS method (NDW-IMATCS) is able to recover the nonsparse signal and leads to the reconstruction results. Finally, we demonstrate that our dual-mesh method combined with the NDW-IMATCS algorithm leads to fast, accurate, and stable reconstructions of nonsparse objects.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2876164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8493316","Adaptive thresholding;dual-mesh;inverse scattering;microwave tomography;nondecimal wavelet transform","Image reconstruction;Iterative methods;Inverse problems;Microwave imaging;Microwave theory and techniques;Thresholding (Imaging);Wavelet transforms","","4","","31","IEEE","16 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By investigating the CMs of the aircraft body in the entire HF band, three types of radiation patterns are synthesized at three frequency bands centered at 8, 18, and 28 MHz, respectively. The synthesis is achieved through the linear weighting combinations of the first few dominant CMs, and a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is implemented to seek the complex weighting coefficients in each band. Following the theoretically synthesized radiating currents, three pairs of exciters are then designed and flush mounted on optimal locations over the aircraft. Furthermore, properly designed LC matching networks are introduced in each exciter to get good impedance matching in each band. Because of the large physical size of the aircraft, scaled model of the proposed aircraft-integrated multiantenna system was fabricated and experimentally verified.

Initially, the radiation characteristic of a rectangular MPA operating in TM30 mode is theoretically investigated. The results demonstrate that its E-plane sidelobe could be gradually reduced by decreasing the resonant frequency of TM30 mode (f30). As such, a pair of parallel slots is etched out on the radiating patch so as to significantly decrease the f30. After that, the MPA under an operation of TM12 mode is further studied. It illustrates that its radiation pattern has the maximum off broadside direction and can be transformed into the broadside radiation by enlarging the length of the parallel slots. In addition, the width of the radiating patch is progressively enlarged in order to reallocate the dual modes in proximity to each other. With these arrangements, a wide bandwidth with improved radiation characteristics is obtained for the antenna under dual resonance. Finally, a prototype aperture-coupled MPA is fabricated and measured. The simulated and measured results agree well with each other, thus demonstrating that its impedance bandwidth is dramatically extended to about 14.8% with a low-profile property of about 0.048 free-space wavelength in thickness. Besides, the antenna has achieved a stable gain varied from 7.0 to 9.9 dBi over the operating band.

Via the concept of generalized material-independent PML, this new implementation can also be used to truncate arbitrary media. Furthermore, since its iteration forms are similar to those of the convolutional PML (CPML) that has been widely used in FDTD simulations, the proposal can be directly applied to existing codes with only minor changes.

The operating frequency of the proposed tag antenna is very stable for both the dielectric and metallic objects, which is very desirable for practical applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2878346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8510883","Compact tag antenna;folded patch;platform insensitive;matching network","Slot lines;Impedance;Integrated circuits;Transmitting antennas;Resonant frequency","","23","","16","IEEE","26 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An ultra-wideband tightly coupled dipole array (TCDA) co-designed with low scattering characteristics is developed in this communication. The TCDA element within an infinite array is designed from 4 to 16 GHz for VSMR <; 2.6 when scanning up to ±60°. To investigate the scattering performances of the proposed TCDA, a tapered slot array (TSA) with the same aperture size as that of the TCDA is selected as a reference antenna with comparable radiation characteristics. Two prototypes for the proposed TCDA and the reference TSA have been fabricated and measured. Simulated and experimental results show that the proposed TCDA has a scattering cross section (SCS) reduction band ranging from 4 to 18 GHz at normal incidence. The comparisons of monostatic SCS under oblique incidence at several sample frequencies are also considered for both the TE and TM polarizations in different planes. A reasonable agreement is obtained between measurement and simulation results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2880038","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631006,61571101,61721001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532345","Scattering cross section (SCS);tightly coupled dipole array (TCDA);ultra-wideband;wide-scanning angle","Scattering;Phased arrays;Wideband;Ultra wideband technology;Frequency measurement;Impedance","","42","","25","IEEE","12 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna is composed of two stacked orthogonal-orientated PIFAs which can be fabricated by elaborately folding one piece of metal plate. The two PIFAs can be excited synchronously with equally allocated power by a single probe, thus a pair of orthogonal polarizations is created. Moreover, the resonant lengths of the upper and lower PIFAs are slightly different from each other to acquire 90° phase shift between the two orthogonal polarizations. Consequently, a right-hand CP radiation is achieved, and the boresight realized gain is 3.8 dBic at the center frequency. The proposed dual-layer PIFA with two quarter-wavelength resonators provides a novel solution for the compactness of CP antennas. To validate the performance of the antenna, a prototype was fabricated and measured. The measured -10 dB impedance bandwidth and 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth are 7.4% and 1.1%, respectively, with a compact antenna volume of 0.26 × 0.22 × 0.05 λ30. The proposed antenna is a good candidate for the 433 MHz CP active radio-frequency identification reader, and it has the merits of compact size, lightweight, high efficiency, and low cost.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2880093","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61525104,61771280); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:4182029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8529265","Circularly polarized (CP);dual layer;planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA);radio-frequency identification (RFID)","Resonant frequency;Feeds;Probes;Antenna radiation patterns;Bandwidth;Antenna measurements","","40","","25","IEEE","9 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The latter feature is highly desired in millimeter wave (mm-wave) and terahertz band. In this communication, a novel method is proposed to convert bounded spoof SPPs mode to radiation mode. An equivalent radiating aperture is formed by gradually decreasing the grooves of an odd-mode plasmonic structure. The mechanism of SPPs wave radiating out through the aperture is clarified by referring to a horn antenna. Furthermore, a spoof SPPs traveling-wave antenna prototype is designed and measured to validate the concept. Measured results show that the antenna has a high gain (~15 dB) and high radiating efficiency (~90%) at the mm-wave frequency. The measured narrow beamwidth in endfire direction indicates that it can be used to construct switched-beam arrays for 5G applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2879847","Industrial Key Technologies Program of Nantong(grant numbers:GY22016015); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20161281); Nantong University-Nantong Joint Research Center for Intelligent Information Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8529251","High efficiency;high gain;millimeter wave (mm-wave) antenna;surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs);traveling-wave structure","Antenna measurements;Apertures;Surface waves;Plasmons;Millimeter wave communication;Millimeter wave technology","","91","","30","IEEE","9 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
