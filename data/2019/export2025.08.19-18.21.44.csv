The aperture is excited by a cross-shaped patch, and a loop-shaped balun structure placed below the patch is introduced to convert the single-ended signal into differential one to drive the patch. In this way, the energy can propagate on the patch in a traveling waveform and illuminate the aperture with uniform E-field distributions. Therefore, the antenna achieves good electrical and radiation performances, which are comparable to its balanced-fed counterparts, while processing a simplified structure. Measured results demonstrate that the impedance bandwidth of the antenna covers the 60 GHz license-free band (57-64 GHz), and the maximum gain can reach 11.5 dBi with a cavity area of only about 27 mm2. Furthermore, the element is successfully extended to a 4 × 4 element array using a substrate-integrated-waveguide based feeding network to further increase the gain up to 20.4 dBi.

The radiation regions for these modes are classified by the dispersion (ω-β) diagram that determines an axial phase propagation constant as a function of frequency. The analytical radiation characteristic findings are validated computationally using CST-MW Studio software. The effective axial length of the plasma generated inside the tube can be gradually increased or decreased as a function of input power, which, in turn, helps to tune/retune the resonant plasma antenna to the desired frequency.

The proposed spatial-reuse dual antenna pair consists of a split on the metallic bezel and a slot on the mainboard ground, where the slot is centered on the split. Two orthogonal degenerate characteristic modes operating at half wavelength including in-phase current and slot modes can be excited on the same antenna structure. An end-shorted microstrip line that crosses the split is used to excite the in-phase current mode, producing y-polarized radiation, while a symmetrical slot-centered Y-shaped feeding network with its shorted ends crossing the slot is adopted to excite the slot mode, producing x-polarized radiation. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first time that a co-frequency dual antenna pair suitable for smartphone with metallic bezels is proposed. A sub-6 GHz dual antenna pair operating at 3.5 GHz that occupies a footprint of 25 × 7 × 1.5 mm3 shows a simulated isolation better than -24.1 dB without any external decoupling measures and an envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) lower than 0.008. A four-antenna MIMO array is fabricated and measured to verify the feasibility. Across the operation band, the measured isolation of the antenna pair is better than -20.1 dB and other isolation levels are all better than -12.7 dB, the ECCs of any two antennas are lower than 0.13, and the total efficiency range of the four antennas is 35.2% 64.7%.

The substrate-integrated surface-wave structure can be considered approximately as a dielectric slab flush-mounted in a rectangular waveguide that has the top broad wall removed. The waveguide structure is investigated rigorously through the numerical solution of a magnetic-field integral equation. It is found that the dielectric-filled structure supports an improper waveguide mode and a proper surface-wave mode. The differences between the two modes are revealed, with the propagation and radiation characteristics and the equivalent magnetic current distributions in the aperture. The improper waveguide mode has such a high attenuation constant that it cannot provide a high directivity. On the other hand, the proper surface-wave mode that has a zero attenuation constant can be used to design a high-directivity antenna. A tapered-width substrate integrated surface-wave antenna is designed, fabricated and measured. With a planar structure, the antenna can be easily fabricated and can be flush-mounted on a conductor.

A prototype consisting of one B1-band antenna and a 2×2 B2-band antenna array is fabricated. Measured results show that the proposed dual-band dual-polarized array achieves 32.7% and 33.3% bandwidth in the B1 and B2 bands, respectively. Measured results also demonstrate that the proposed array offers stable radiation patterns, high gains, and high cross-polarization discriminations (XPD > 20 dB) across the two frequency bands. These attractive features make this array an ideal candidate for future 5G massive MIMO base station antenna developments.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2916730","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671127,61721001,61631006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718483","Base station antennas;dual-band antenna;dual-polarized antenna;fifth generation (5G) communications","Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Frequency selective surfaces;Base stations;Dipole antennas;5G mobile communication","","218","","24","IEEE","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Characteristic modes (CMs) contain similar physical insights but without the limitations owing to its full-wave nature. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for the codesign of DRAs and feeding structures using CMs. The volume-surface formulation combining substructure treatment is adopted to calculate CMs of DRAs. To detailedly demonstrate the proposed method, electric and magnetic feeding structures are utilized to excite a cubic DRA as examples. Compared with the results obtained by an isolated design of DRAs and feeding structures, characteristic mode analysis (CMA) of the whole structure reveals several new modes, in which the lower order modes correspond to much lower resonant frequencies. Proper modifications of the feeding structures can effectively excite these modes and result in dual- and triple-band operation. Several prototypes were fabricated and measured for verification. For a cubic DRA with a side length of 25.4 mm, it achieves a triple-band operation at 1.6, 3.1, and 4.6 GHz. Therefore, this method is ideal for the codesign of arbitrary DRAs with feeding structures.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2916763","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61427083,61521091); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718476","Characteristic modes (CMs);dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs);feeding structure;multiband","Dielectrics;Resonant frequency;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Substrates;Dielectric resonator antennas;Shape;Permittivity","","38","","19","IEEE","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The LC's anisotropy is applied inside a semicircular shaped parallel-plate waveguide to achieve a deflection of the propagating electromagnetic wave at the interface of lower and higher permittivities. Using an electrode network, the direction of the sector of higher permittivity can be adjusted and, therefore, so can the beam direction. The main advantage of this antenna concept is that neither phase shifters nor switching networks are needed, resulting in a very simple approach for beam steering. Operating at V-band, from 50 to 75 GHz, the first demonstrator proves the antenna concept by reconfiguring the beam in predefined directions of -30°, 0°, and +30° to simplify the electrode biasing network. Furthermore, it is feasible and being demonstrated to adjust the beamwidth and to generate multiple beams. In the measurements, the antenna exhibits a measured input reflection below -10 dB over the complete frequency range. For the unsteered radiation pattern, the sidelobe level is between -8 and -12 dB, whereas these values degrade to -4.5 to -6 dB for the steered radiation pattern at ±30°.

For each 4 × 2 subarray, the lower and upper 4 × 1 subarrays are misaligned in the horizontal plane. By using this innovative scheme, the 4 × 2 subarray is equivalent to an 8 × 1 subarray with a half adjacent-element spacing, resulting in good grating-lobe suppression. For achieving stable two-beam radiation with low sidelobe over a wide frequency band, specific wideband beam-forming networks with little magnitude and phase imbalances are designed. Moreover, the adjacent-element spacing is optimized to obtain stable 10 dB beamwidth around 120°, thus satisfying the coverage requirement of 120° in the horizontal plane for base-station applications.

The proposed C2-WORD algorithm is a modified version of the existing WORD approach. We extend WORD by allowing a complex-valued combining coefficient in C2-WORD, and then determine the optimal combining coefficient by maximizing the white noise gain. Moreover, assuming that the steering vector uncertainty is norm-bounded, we further devise a robust C2-WORD algorithm, which is able to precisely control the upper boundary response level of a sidelobe point as desired. To enhance the practicality of the proposed robust C2-WORD algorithm, we also study how to determine the upper norm boundary of steering vector uncertainty under various mismatch circumstances. By applying the robust C2-WORD algorithm iteratively, a robust sidelobe synthesis approach is developed. Contrary to the existing approaches, the devised robust C2-WORD algorithm offers an analytical expression of weight vector updating and can work starting from an arbitrarily specified weight.

In the proposed scheme, the progressive phase difference between the adjacent antenna elements is controlled not only by the interconnecting line in-between but also by an extra phase term introduced by a newly added phase shifter. According to the theoretical prediction, the main beam of the retransmitted wave can be steered to an arbitrary direction irrespective of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the incident wave. A linear four-element quasi-Yagi array, controlled by 4-bit phase shifters, is applied as a preliminary proof-of-concept.

Here, we report that hyperbolic dispersion can be mimicked by exploiting the structural dispersion of electromagnetic modes in waveguides filled with anisotropic dielectric materials. As demonstrated, the material parameters in the waveguide are subtly designed, and effective hyperbolic dispersion is achieved, which can reduce the dielectric loss and nonlocal effects related to the finite thickness of the discrete constituent elements of metamaterials at microwave frequencies.

Although this method has been demonstrated to be accurate and long-time stable, further efforts are still desirable to remove the buffer zone and to implement an implicit-explicit time integration from the perspective of practical applications. In this paper, a novel hybrid method is proposed, which not only successfully eliminates the necessity of the buffer zone without compromising the featured advantage (e.g., nonconformal mesh) but also effectively applies an implicit-explicit time integration scheme to improve the computational efficiency. Furthermore, the new method extends the hybridization to a broader level by incorporating the spectral element time domain (SETD) method based on the discontinuous Galerkin and domain decomposition techniques, resulting in a more general hybrid FDTD/SETD/FETD framework. The framework employs the explicit leapfrog time integration for the FDTD region while it employs the implicit Crank-Nicolson time integration for the FETD region. For the SETD region, either the implicit or explicit time integration can be employed, depending on the mesh sizes in it. When the implicit region becomes large, it can be further split into multiple subdomains to reduce computational complexity. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the performance of the proposed hybrid method, which is accurate, long-time stable and more efficient than the hybrid method with a buffer zone.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2913740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8705654","Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method;domain decomposition;finite difference time domain (FDTD) method;finite element time domain (FETD) method;implicit–explicit time integration;nonconformal mesh;spectral element time domain (SETD) method","Time-domain analysis;Finite difference methods;Finite element analysis;Couplings;Method of moments;Antennas;Numerical stability","","24","","39","IEEE","3 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, new challenges arise for system designers as the attenuation of the signal crossing the troposphere increases with frequency. Propagation experiments, such as the on-going Alphasat campaign, provide direct measurements of the attenuation. However, other data sources, such as collocated radiometers, are needed to recover the attenuation in nonrainy conditions. This paper uses the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) software and investigates Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models as an alternative source of nonrainy attenuation time series. Four months of measured Alphasat and radiometric signals collected at Spino d'Adda serve as the reference to assess the accuracy of NWP-derived attenuation.

The campaign is conducted with transmit antennas representing the sensors deployed in different indoor environments and receiver antennas mounted on an outside tower representing the DF center. Channel measurements are reported when a 20 MHz wide signal is transmitted at 2.53 GHz. Measurements are collected for different spatial combinations of the transmit antennas. After analyzing the collected data, the performance of different DF rules is compared and tested over the measured channel. The results show that the fusion rules perform differently over different sets of measured channels.

The GSS is spread on the SSPP waveguide along the propagation direction to dissipate the SSPP wave. By applying the proper bias voltage to the GSS, the surface impedance of the GSS can be tuned while accordingly modifying the attenuation of the attenuator.

For the dual-polarized antenna operation, a novel feeding network with a hook-shaped self-coupled line is employed for a pair of magnetoelectric dipoles to obtain filtering radiation performance. This self-coupled line can not only ensure the impedance matching within the passband, but also generate a radiation null at the upper band edge, further suppressing the out-of-band antenna radiation. Since no complex filter circuit is involved in the antenna function design, the in-band radiation performance of the antenna is nearly not affected. Thus, both satisfactory filtering and radiation performances are obtained. With respect to the filter operation, the magnetoelectric dipole of the component does not radiate but functions as the ground of the feeding network, and the feed lines act as two resonators, forming a second-order bandpass filter. For demonstration, the two-port component with both antenna and filter operations is implemented and fabricated.

The inputs of the ROM are the equivalent currents enclosing the AUT, and the outputs are their corresponding radiated fields on the measurement surface. By performing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the radiating operator, we derive the minimal order model of the system and thereby numerically construct the basis of the fields radiated by the AUT. The evaluation of the so-reduced model is expedited by using a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) that returns the sampling positions of the radiated field. The approach is tailored to the antenna characterization problem and specifically the antenna shape and the measurement surface scan. The proposed methodology is general, and it can be easily adapted to any type of radiating structures and shape of the field measurement scans.

This communication uses the conventional least squares (LSs) method and the theory of characteristic modes (CMs) to find the efficient beam steering algorithm for a multiport chassis antenna. Owing to orthogonal properties of the CMs, the following two advantages emerge: 1) the algorithm provides a simple LS solution without computation of matrix inversion and 2) the physical meaning of this simple LS solution is equivalent to the narrowband time-reversal processing, i.e., phase conjugation processing. Consequently, the proposed algorithm makes it possible to efficiently control the radiation pattern of the multiport antenna in the desired direction with any kind of desired polarization.

Enabling by a cylindrical dielectric resonator (CDR), this communication proposes a passive wireless sensor for ubiquitous crack monitoring. The proposed CDR can excite a HE $_{ {11\delta }}$  mode and its polarization can be configured through the change of the polarization of the incident wave. Due to the high dielectric substrate selected, the proposed CDR has a compact size of 24.0 mm (diameter)  $\times \,\, 9.0$  mm (height). By confining the near-field energy into a small magnetic wall, the CDR is naturally turned into a sensitive crack sensor. Crack growth causes a continuous shift in the resonant frequency of the radar cross section (RCS). This behavior can be wirelessly monitored in a distance of 0.25 m through a horn antenna. For a fixed crack width of 2.0 mm, the sensitivity in crack depth characterization is 25.4 MHz/mm.
