The heterogeneous substrate designs presented are printed with a dual-extrusion fused deposition modeling printer consisting of a combination of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) tiles surrounded with flexible NinjaFlex (NF). The impact of combining these two materials with similar electric permittivty is a distribution of loss tangent in the substrate, which controls its RF performance while maintaining the flexibility. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, three flexible 3-D printed microstrip patch antenna prototypes are designed, realized, and measured at 2.4 GHz, where the RF performance is characterized with different curvatures. The predicted and experimental results were observed to be in good agreement. All three designs show antenna performance stability with curvature, and a resonant frequency shifts less than 1.4%. Increases of up to 250% in gain or 400% in bandwidth were observed with varying ABS to NF percentage area. Furthermore, these flexible antenna designs are tested with human body contact for wearable applications, and the measured RF performance remains stable. This heterogeneous substrate design approach using an array of arbitrarily shaped tiles is scalable, simple, and can be implemented in a variety of RF design applications for flexibility.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2896762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8630967","3-D printing;conformal antenna;flexible electronics;NinjaFlex (NF);patch antenna;wearable antenna","Substrates;Noise measurement;Antennas;Radio frequency;Printing;Dielectric losses;Bandwidth","","41","","27","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, conducting design procedures that require multiple evaluations of the antenna at hand, such as parametric optimization or yield-driven design, is hindered due to the high cost of accurate EM analysis. To a certain extent, this issue can be addressed using fast replacement models (also referred to as surrogates). Unfortunately, due to curse of dimensionality, traditional data-driven surrogate modeling methods are limited to antenna structures described by a few parameters with relatively narrow parameter ranges. This is by no means sufficient given the complexity of modern designs. In this paper, a novel technique for surrogate modeling of antenna structures is proposed. It involves a construction of two levels of surrogates, both realized as kriging interpolation models. The first model is based on a set of reference designs optimized for selected performance figures. It is used to establish a domain for the final (second level) surrogate. This formulation permits efficient modeling within wide ranges of antenna geometry parameters and wide ranges of performance figures (e.g., operating frequencies). At the same time, it allows uniform allocation of training data samples in a straightforward manner. Our approach is demonstrated using two microstrip antenna examples and is compared with conventional kriging and radial basis function modeling. Application examples for antenna optimization are also provided along with experimental validation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2896761","Icelandic Centre for Research(grant numbers:174114051); National Science Centre of Poland(grant numbers:2015/17/B/ST6/01857); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8631127","Antenna design;approximation models;kriging interpolation;simulation-driven design;surrogate modeling","Optimization;Geometry;Computational modeling;Manifolds;Dipole antennas;Interpolation","","130","","36","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One desirable property for the antenna in these types of applications is a high scanning rate where a small change in frequency can lead to significant changes in beam angle.

Empirical examinations confirm that the devised diamond-grid-shaped 2000 Å-thick Ag-alloy electrodes on a glass substrate feature electrical loss characteristics of approximately 0.4 dB/mm at 28 GHz amid 88% optical transparency. Using the aforementioned material, a transparent diamond-grid antenna element is formulated and verified. Complete optical invisibility is achieved by implementing identical dummy grids around the antenna region. A multilayer schematic is designed in order to expand the antenna element into a phased-array configuration. The designed and fabricated 1 × 8 optically invisible AoD exhibits 6.66 dBi boresight gain at 28 GHz while maintaining 88% optical transparency. This gain includes 1.5 dB feedline loss and approximately 4 dB anisotropic conductive film (ACF) bonding loss.

Also, the feasibility of the simple approximations to the transformed material properties is demonstrated in the design procedure of the presented LLA. Compared with the benchmark, the proposed mapping can achieve a moderate index distribution, wider scanning range, lighter weight, as well as an easy implementation. For example, a slab consisting of 18-layered Gaussian-distributed gradient index metamaterials is utilized to realize an X-band dual-polarized LLA with an aperture of 94.3×94.3 mm2, a thickness of 14.9 mm, and a focal length of 44 mm. Three nonresonant unit cells of patch, circular, and square holes are used for the upper, middle, and lower index regions, respectively. Moreover, a prototype of half of the designed LLA combined with a PEC sheet is implemented for a conformal application. The experiments reveal that our design can achieve a ~20% bandwidth for both |S11| <; -10 dB and |S21| <; -17$ dB, a scanning angle of ±54° with a scanning loss of 0.7/2.2 dB, a peak gain of ~13/13.2 dBi, and a cross-polarization level of less than -15/-16 dB for the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations at 10 GHz, respectively.

The PAF system consists of an array feed, a receiver, a beamformer, and a parabolic reflector. The novel aspect of our model is the characterization of the PAF system by a single matrix. This characteristic matrix is constructed from the open-circuit voltage covariance (OCVC) at the output of the PAF due to a signal from the observing source, ground spillover noise, sky background noise, and (low-noise) amplifier (LNA) noise. The best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the source achievable with the PAF system will be the maximum eigenvalue of the characteristic matrix. The voltage covariance due to signal and spillover noise is derived by applying the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. The receiver noise covariance and noise temperature are obtained in terms of Lange invariants such that they are suitable for noise matching the array feed. The model predictions are compared with the measured performance of a 1.4 GHz, 19-element, dual-polarized PAF on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. We show that the model predictions, obtained with an additional noise contribution due to the measured losses ahead of the LNA, compare well with the measured ratio of system temperature to aperture efficiency as a function of frequency and as a function of offset from the boresight. Furthermore, our modeling indicates that the bandwidth over which this ratio is optimum can be improved by a factor of at least two by noise matching the PAF with the LNA.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2899046","National Radio Astronomy Observatory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8664188","Amplifier noise;antenna array feeds;antenna array mutual coupling;phased arrays","Temperature measurement;Covariance matrices;Feeds;Frequency measurement;Antenna arrays;Impedance;Predictive models","","10","","44","OAPA","10 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By introducing the entropy concept into 4-D irregular arrays, the original synthesis problem is simplified into two problems, which can be solved in two steps separately. In the first step, the optimization of the topology of 4-D irregular arrays characterized by domino-shaped tiles is performed, based on the principle of entropy maximization.

The basic concept is to realize the theoretical phases required to produce a set of orthogonal beams by the discrete Fourier transform representation of excitation weightings. Thus, the focal points to feed the Rotman lens are selected on an elliptic arc to produce directional beams among this set of orthogonal beams. A periodic phase impression is afterward performed to excite the residue elements excluding the subarrays, which subsequently creates an amplitude taper of excitation to reduce SLLs.

This power divider is deployed to excite and test the proposed differential feeding antenna. The proposed antenna is formed by a rectangular aperture having a circular-shaped polarizer consisting of patch surrounded by an open-end ring, which is differentially fed. This polarizer is deployed to achieve a circular polarization radiation through a 10 % frequency bandwidth. A high-gain antenna array is implemented by extending the aperture size to have four radiating elements. The antenna array is fabricated, where the experimental results verify a -10 dB impedance bandwidth from 27.7 to 32.4 GHz (15.6%). Moreover, a 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth over 10 % is achieved, which is sufficient enough to cover the operating bandwidth of potential 5G applications at 30 GHz.

The metal-frame blockage to mm-wave antennas with different polarizations is investigated first. It is found that the blockage is more severe for horizontal polarization than for vertical polarization. The effect of the metal bezel on an mm-wave array with horizontal polarization can be significantly decreased if two-tilted layers of coupled metal strips are placed at the borders of the frame. Furthermore, these metal strips are shown not to disturb the mm-wave antennas with vertical polarization. Different detailed design considerations are studied. To further demonstrate the idea, a 5G Vivaldi array (with horizontal polarization) is designed and integrated with a metal frame. The frame functions as a low-frequency antenna, operating in two frequency bands of 865-990 and 1358-2786 MHz. The mm-wave array with four elements operates at the frequency band 24.25-27.5 GHz and can scan ±60° in endfire direction, with a realized gain higher than 7 dBi in most of the frequency range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2900407","Innovationsfonden; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648488","5G mobile communication;antenna array;millimeter-wave (mm-wave) integrated circuit;Vivaldi antennas","Metals;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna arrays;Mobile antennas;Telephone sets;Gain","","53","","24","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We define an alternative unit cell called the equivalent rectangle, which has the same tensor impedance properties of a general polygon unit cell in the surface impedance pattern. The size of the equivalent rectangle cell is calculated by using the moment of inertia equations between the polygon and the rectangle. The extracted surface impedance from the equivalent rectangle is compared to the surface impedance of polygon in the unit cell simulation, validating our method.

In fact, it actually gives the complete general superposition solution, which also explains that the existing PML considers only a rational boundary operator and solves only a coordinately aligned example. The construction thus embraces both general order polynomial and nonpolynomial boundary operators and noncoordinately aligned boundary solutions to be put on top of the PML orthogonal terminations. A constructive source-field energy coupling relation is also introduced to simplify the impedance conservation analysis to read as the triple product identity.

Numerous schemes have been proposed over the years for the purpose of taking care of this instability. Among them, the marching-on-in-degree (MOD) method is one of the newly proposed algorithms for calculating the various transient responses. The MOD solver employs a set of associated Laguerre functions and incorporates exact temporal Galerkin testing. Although the MOD scheme is assumed to be more stable when compared with marching-on-in-time (MOT), there are few numerical or theoretical investigations on the stability of the various numerical recursive operations for the MOD methodology. It has been shown that the time-domain magnetic field integral equation (TD-MFIE) using the MOD method can be stabilized by using a Filon-type quadrature formula to accurately integrate the highly oscillatory Laguerre functions which has caused instability for the MOD solvers using a higher degree of approximation. On the other hand, the analytical expression of temporal derivatives used in the MOD scheme is strongly affected by an unbounded initial value of the transient current. In this paper, a novel Filon-type radial integration method and a sequential constraint term for TD-EFIE-MOD are proposed, which make the stabilized MOD solver accurate and stable for the arbitrary degree of the Laguerre polynomials. Some numerical results are presented to illustrate the validity of the stabilized MOD solution of TD-EFIE for transient scattering problems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2901067","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61301029); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:14510711600); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities(grant numbers:17D110417); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8649754","Associated Laguerre functions;electric field integral equation;highly oscillatory quadrature;marching-on-in-degree (MOD);stability;time-domain integral equation (TDIE)","Integral equations;Numerical stability;Stability analysis;Transient analysis;Time-domain analysis;Electric fields;Testing","","9","","44","IEEE","22 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The primary unknowns on each element are replaced by the equivalent electric and magnetic current distributions on the equivalence sphere in terms of RWG basis functions. From these current distributions, the scattered field outside its equivalence sphere is evaluated in terms of SWHs in the local coordinates system fixed to each element body. The SWHs in rotated local coordinates are translated as a new set of SWHs in other local coordinates with the same origin but axes parallel to the global coordinate's axes using the rotation addition theorem. Furthermore, the mutual coupling effects among the separated domains are considered using the translation addition theorem for parallel local coordinate systems.

This WF-based technique exploits the atmospheric attenuation as a random variable related to the statistic of the transmission error rate that drives the received data-volume and its uncertainty. The WF-based technique is evaluated for the test case of the BepiColombo mission to Mercury from ESA (European space agency) considering Cebreros and Malargue receiving ground-stations. Tuning and verification of the adopted models were accomplished exploiting ground-based meteorological measurements (weather stations, radiosoundings, and microwave radiometer) and simulating four years of data transmission. Results, in terms of yearly received data-volume and its uncertainty, highlight the advantages of short-term WF-based atmospheric statistics in opposition to the commonly used long-term climatological statistics.

As to oblique incidence, the random patch approach is adopted for metal layers. By avoiding periodic structures, the likelihood of strong backscattering peaks is diminished. Rigorous parametric studies as well as prototype measurements were conducted to analyze and to verify the design's superb performances.

These trenches allow for the deposition of the liquids to be detected. The variation in the dielectric characteristics of the liquids inserted produces a change in the reflected phase of the EBG. This change in the phase could be detected in various ways. In this paper, a planar antenna has been placed at a short distance from the EBG structure. The changes in the phase in the surface waves produce a change in the reflection coefficient of the antenna. Butan-1-ol, propan-2-ol, ethanol, and methanol have been inserted to demonstrate the tuning technique. In order to complete the experiments, the reflection coefficients and the radiation patterns were measured. Good agreement has been found between the simulated and measured results.

By MMA, we mean a single physical radiator with multiple ports, which excite different characteristic modes. In contrast to phased arrays, a closed-form mathematical model of the antenna response, such as a steering vector, is not straightforward to define for MMAs. Instead, one has to rely on calibration measurement or electromagnetic field (EMF) simulation data, which is discrete. To perform DoA estimation, an array interpolation technique (AIT) and wavefield modeling (WM) are suggested as methods with inherent interpolation capabilities, fully taking antenna nonidealities like mutual coupling into account. We present a noncoherent DoA estimator for low-cost receivers and show how coherent DoA estimation and joint DoA and polarization estimation can be performed with MMAs. Utilizing these methods, we assess the DoA estimation performance of an MMA prototype in simulations for both the 2-D and 3-D cases. The results show that WM outperforms AIT for high signal-to-noise ratio. The coherent estimation is superior to noncoherent, especially in 3-D, because noncoherent suffers from estimation ambiguities. In conclusion, the DoA estimation with a single MMA is feasible and accurate.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2899010","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:FI 2176/1-1,HO 2226/17-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8640822","Angle of arrival;array interpolation technique (AIT);characteristic modes;manifold separation;received signal strength (RSS);wavefield modeling (WM)","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Phased arrays;Interpolation;Antenna measurements","","30","","51","IEEE","12 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It allows the use of small scan surfaces around the transmitting antenna to acquire the scattered field, thus significantly reducing the required number of measurements compared to a full bistatic approach. At the same time, and unlike image-based approaches, it does not suffer from inaccuracies due to multiple interactions at the object. The method solves a series of inverse source problems for all NF illuminations and computes the monostatic RCS by a subsequent plane-wave synthesis of the incident field. Great flexibility and computational efficiency are achieved by working with a hierarchical multilevel propagating plane-wave expansion of the incident and scattered field. This allows almost arbitrarily shaped scan surfaces and arbitrary measurement probes to be processed very efficiently. The theory of the algorithm is outlined in detail and its performance is assessed by considering numerical studies as well as experimental data from measurements. It is shown that the overall accuracy mainly depends on the quality of the synthesized plane-wave field, which is controlled by adapting the angular range spanned by the locations of the transmitting antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2900421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648499","Near-field (NF) far-field (FF) transformation;plane-wave field synthesis;radar cross section (RCS) measurement","Antenna measurements;Transmitting antennas;Scattering;Noise measurement;Three-dimensional displays;Radar cross-sections","","18","","34","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on a bilinear expression for the magnitude-only measurements, the result for any desired magnitude-only measurement sample is synthetically calculated as a linear combination of sufficiently many previous measurement samples. In this way, signals, which allow for a straightforward computation of the phase difference between a pair of measurement samples, are obtained. Its high numerical complexity limits the algorithm to problems of moderate size, but understanding and using the algorithm delivers new insight into the phase retrieval problem and allows to evaluate the feasibility of specific measurement procedures and configurations. In particular, we show that there exist at most NDOF2 independent phaseless measurements for an AUT with NDOF degrees of freedom (DoFs). Any additional phaseless measurement can be calculated as a linear combination of those NDOF2 measurement samples. Under certain circumstances, much less than NDOF2 measurement samples are sufficient to retrieve the magnitude and phase of the measured field at desired locations. A numerical example shows that the presented method is capable, in principle, to reconstruct all relevant NF information needed for a conventional NF far-field transformation (NFFFT) from noiseless irregularly distributed squared magnitude field samples only. In addition, it is shown that measurements with specialized probes can bring more information into the problem than measurements on surfaces with different distances to the AUT. When it comes to true noisy measurement data, the presented method can reconstruct NF magnitudes reliably, but the reconstruction of phase information is sensitive to noise.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2900414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648461","Antenna measurements;inverse problems;near-field far-field transformation (NFFFT);phase estimation","Antenna measurements;Phase measurement;Noise measurement;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Size measurement;Current measurement","","19","","55","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effect of cavity resonances is analyzed in detail and we show how it is used to reduce the interference in adjacent frequency bands. This communication also proposes an elegant method of integrating this type of antennas into the satellite chassis, which reduces the antenna extrusion on the satellite surface.

Complex plasmonic surfaces can provide a large degree of freedom to engineer the characteristics of SPP dispersion. However, the analysis of complex plasmonic surfaces is difficult using the existing theoretical methods, such as the effective medium model and mode matching model. Recently, an accurate field-network-joint method has been introduced into the dispersion analysis of complex plasmonic surfaces, but it only works in the lossless case. In this communication, lossy complex plasmonic surfaces are investigated based on the modified field-network-joint method. The proposed method can predict not only the dispersion relationship between the frequency and the wavenumber, but also the lossy feature of the plasmonic surface with high efficiency and accuracy. As an example, a periodic structure with biforked slits filled by a lossy medium is fabricated and measured. The calculated attenuation constant (i.e., the imaginary part of the wavenumber) of the lossy structure is nearly identical to the measured result, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed analytical method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2901123","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871127,61701246,61631007,61571117,61501112,61501117,61522106,61722106,61701107,61701108); 111 Project(grant numbers:111-2-05); Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund TIER 1(grant numbers:2017-T1-001-239 [RG91/17 (S)]); TIER 2(grant numbers:MOE2015-T2-1-145); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8649724","Field-network joint solution;loss;structured plasmonic surface;surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)","Impedance;Surface waves;Optical surface waves;Dielectric losses;Dispersion;Propagation losses","","19","","31","IEEE","22 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, one novel miniaturized MS unit cell is proposed. By introducing a pair of capacitiveloading strips inserted along the diagonal of a corner-truncated patch, 56% size reduction is achieved for this miniaturized unit cell. Accordingly, a compact CP MS antenna of a 4 × 4 array composed by the miniaturized unit cells is designed and fed by a slot structure. Compared with the conventional CP MS antenna without capacitive-loading strips, 63% overall size reduction can be achieved. Furthermore, the CP radiation mechanism of the CP MS antenna is revealed and explained clearly using the characteristic mode analysis (CMA). For demonstration, a prototype of the proposed CP antenna was fabricated and measured. The measured 3 dB axial ratio (AR) band is from 3.33 to 3.63 GHz, and the 10 dB impedance band is from 3.02 to 3.82 GHz, while 6.5 dBi gain is realized within the CP operating band.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2902735","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571231,61601224); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20160844); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657964","Capacitive loading;characteristic mode analysis (CMA);metasurface (MS);miniaturized circularly polarized (CP) antenna","Strips;Antenna arrays;Loading;Reflection;Loaded antennas;Resonant frequency","","114","","15","IEEE","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simple guidelines are proposed to design the absorber using the impedance analysis of its equivalent circuit model. The 10 dB reflection reduction for 120% fractional bandwidth from 3 to 12 GHz is achieved by generating three resonances using a single element in the unit cell. The thickness at the lowest cutoff frequency of the proposed absorber is thus obtained as 0.080λL(λL is the wavelength at the lowest cutoff frequency). It is shown that the proposed absorber is polarization insensitive and capable of reducing radar cross section for all the reflection angles in both monostatic and bistatic scenarios. To manufacture the absorber, commercially available low-cost resistive ink, V-shield HSF 74 is used. The measurement results are provided to validate both the full-wave and circuit simulated results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2902660","Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India through DST-INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship Research Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657967","Absorber;bandwidth;frequency selective surface (FSS);radar cross section (RCS);thickness","Frequency selective surfaces;Impedance;Substrates;Resistance;Surface impedance;Bandwidth;Reflection coefficient","","87","","24","IEEE","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the FSS design, the capacitive structure, implemented by convoluted slot grids (CSGs), is introduced to increase the equivalent capacitance of the bandpass FSS, thus leading to a lower resonance frequency. The FSS unit cell size is then reduced accordingly. To validate this design concept, a double-layered bandpass FSS consisting of convoluted slot dipole and CSG structures is designed to provide a unit cell size as small as  $0.035\lambda _{0} \times 0.035\lambda _{0}$ , where  $\lambda _{0}$  refers to the resonance wavelength in the free space. Equivalent circuit of this FSS is established for explaining the resonance mechanism and modeling the frequency performance. Finally, a prototype of the proposed FSS is fabricated and measured. The measured results exhibit the stable filtering response under different polarizations and incidence angles (up to 60°), which also agree well with those obtained by full-wave simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2902633","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401230); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657966","Bandpass;convoluted elements;equivalent circuit;frequency-selective surface (FSS);miniaturization","Frequency selective surfaces;Equivalent circuits;Capacitance;Finite element analysis;Capacitors;Resonant frequency;Integrated circuit modeling","","45","","21","IEEE","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among various solutions, in a previous work, an automatic tool for the over-the-air evaluation of significant RFID tag metrics has been presented. Once the distance is fixed, the system, based on the estimation of the minimum power emitted by the off-the-shelf interrogating reader capable to energize the tag under test, exhibits an accuracy that, although adequate, is affected by the minimum power step at the reader side. In this communication, an evolution of a new platform whose working principle has already been introduced by the same authors is presented. It is based on an analytical model opportunely derived to overcome this limit while preserving flexibility and cost-effectiveness. The platform can automatically vary with continuity the interrogation distance-which becomes a new degree of freedom-and it is able to estimate the couple power distance for each frequency, which practically annuls the estimation error due to the power discretization. Moreover, the enhanced system now allows for a pretest phase that is useful to verify whether or not the implemented analytical model is valid in the specific environment, even if not electromagnetically anechoic.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2902708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657944","Internet of things (IoT);radio frequency identification (RFID);read range;sensitivity;tag;tag antenna","Sensitivity;Estimation;RFID tags;Antennas;Frequency estimation","","21","","24","IEEE","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
