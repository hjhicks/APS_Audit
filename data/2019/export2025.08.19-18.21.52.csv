In this paper, the circularly polarized vortex EM waves with different OAMs have been generated at 2.4 GHz by a novel conical conformal patch antenna (CCPA) consisting of a conical substrate, a correspondingly conformed circular-ring metallic patch, and a single-feed point. First, we analyze the radiated field of a standard circular-ring patch, in which a circularly polarized TMnm mode excited by two coaxial feeds can generate the circularly polarized OAM wave with the topological charge of l = (n-1). Then, a pair of the slot is added to the CCPA for obtaining a simpler structure with a single feed point. By adjusting the size of the slot and the angle between the slot and the single-feed point, two orthogonal modes with the same amplitude and a relative 90° phase shift can be obtained for generating the circularly polarized vortex wave. In addition, we have also tried to use an additional conical horn outside of the CCPA for enhancing the performance of the antenna. Finally, in order to validate the theoretical results, we have also fabricated and measured the CCPA, from which we can confirm that our design is efficient for generating the vortex waves.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2922545","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61775050,11505043); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JZ2018HGBZ0309,JZ2018HGTB0240); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8738980","Circular polarization;conform antenna;horn antenna;vortex wave","Feeds;Patch antennas;Horn antennas;Microstrip antennas;Electromagnetic scattering;Dielectric resonator antennas","","53","","40","IEEE","18 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna is designed by placing multiple inverted-F antennas (IFAs) on an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) ground.

By combining the two modes, a fractional bandwidth of 12% is realized with a profile of 0.01λ0, where λ0 is the free-space wavelength at the center frequency. Within the working band, the radiation efficiencies are higher than 50%, the mutual couplings among antennas lower than -10 dB, and envelope correlation coefficients (ECCs) lower than 0.2. To validate the antenna design, a MIMO antenna with eight elements is fabricated and measured. The antenna can work from 3.4 to 3.8 GHz. The total thickness of the antenna is only 0.97 mm, which can be integrated into smartphones as their back-covers without occupying the inner space of the device.

However, this paper shows that a coupled-resonator model with series-coupled mutual coupling breaks down when applied to multi-mode/multi-port antenna arrays and limits the achievable isolation. An improved model based on parallel-coupled modes is presented. This model suggests that poor isolation is more accurately caused by unbalanced antenna modes. Using this model, several novel examples of simple and compact dual- and triple-mode antennas show how to maximize isolation in multi-mode antennas by balancing the modes' resonant frequencies and radiation bandwidths. For comparison, the mutually coupled assumption limits isolation to around 20 dB in the proposed novel structures, whereas 40-70 dB is possible when parallel-coupled modes are considered. Based on the developed concept, a compact triple-mode two-pole-filtering antenna is fabricated at 3500 MHz with 160 MHz of bandwidth and more than 40 dB of isolation between the antenna ports.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2922551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8738970","Isolation;multi-mode antenna;mutual-coupling;parallel-coupled;radiation-bandwidth","Couplings;Bandwidth;Antenna arrays;Mutual coupling;Antenna radiation patterns;Resonant frequency","","8","","28","IEEE","18 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The metasurface antenna consists of a printed cavity loaded with metamaterial elements which is excited by a coaxial connector. Each metamaterial element radiates a portion of the reverberating fields in the cavity, contributing to an overall beam pattern. To synthesize a desired pattern, the elements need to be arranged in an aperture and radiate with proper weights at their locations. The weight of each element is jointly determined by the geometry of the cavity and the metamaterial element's resonant response. To predict and achieve the required weights, we first provide a full analytic description of the interaction of the cavity and the metamaterial elements. After verifying the analytical model through numerical simulations, we utilize it in an iterative scheme to solve for the metasurface structure that generates a prescribed pattern. Using the outlined procedure, three different antennas are designed, fabricated, and examined in experiments.

By introducing the desired surface wave and reducing the interference between the source and its image, the RIS is able to manipulate the deflected boresight beam and suppress the increased sidelobes for TM-polarized waves, while TE-polarized performance is maintained as in the case where a perfect electrical conductor (PEC) is used. The effects of RIS properties and feeder orientation on antenna isolation and far-field performance are discussed and compared with the PEC cases. To validate this method, two identical X-band half plano-convex dielectric lenses with a diameter of 237 mm and a thickness of 154 mm integrated with two 32°-rotated feeders and RISs of 479 × 258.3 mm2 with a characteristic impedance of j189 Ω are designed as an example. The measured results show that the isolation of >51 and >36 dB over a 10dB return loss bandwidth of 2 GHz is achieved for TE and TM polarization, respectively. Compared to the PEC case, the boresight beam correction reaches 7.5° and the first sidelobe close to the adjacent antenna even vanishes in TM polarization when using the RIS. A boresight gain of 20 dBi/21 dBi at 10 GHz is realized for TE/TM polarization, respectively. Hence, the proposed method is a good option for radar systems requiring compact high-performance transceivers.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2920303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732647","Antenna miniaturization;beam manipulation;dual polarization;half-lens antenna;isolation;mutual coupling;reactive impedance surface (RIS);simultaneous transmit and receive antennas","Lenses;Impedance;Surface impedance;Couplings;Transceivers;Receiving antennas","","5","","37","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a method is proposed to realize endfire radiation with vertical polarization based on the concept of CMPA. Besides the phase controlled by the coupling, the asymmetric feeding introduces additional phase shift to one of the radiation slots, which makes the beam pointing to the forward endfire direction within the whole band. The ground of the antenna is truncated to be the same size of the top patch, which eliminates the undesired effect of the ground edge and ensures the symmetric patterns pointing around endfire direction. The size of the antenna itself is only 0.26λ0×0.44λ0, where λ0 is the free-space wavelength at the center operating frequency. In order to block the unwanted common mode current outside the feeding coaxial cable, a quarter-wavelength balun is applied in the implementation. The fabricated antenna sample has highly selective two-pole S11 response with center frequency of 2.41 GHz and 10 dB fractional bandwidth of 2.5%. The simulated and measured patterns confirm the endfire radiation of the proposed antenna. The measured 3 dB bandwidth of realized gain at forward endfire is 2.5% at center frequency of 2.41 GHz, where the realized gain is 2.8 dBi and the front-to-back (F/B) ratio is 17.1 dB.

The introduced concept is based on expelling the currents flowing between the closely spaced antennas through a tapered slot etched on the array ground plane. The method is free from extra-reactive components and transmission lines. Although they are closely spaced and strongly coupled, the technique allows a high improvement in port isolation. A practical implementation of this mechanism is applied to a monopole array of two elements working at 2.45 GHz and closely packed (0.069λ0). The obtained results are very attractive, and a decoupling of about 40 dB is achieved with good impedance matching. Moreover, radiation diversity is obtained with a gain of 1.9 dBi. Furthermore, the decoupled array is integrated in a real receiving system, and the proposed decoupling technique is checked through the array signal processing. Hence, the obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed decoupling mechanism. In addition to its efficient port isolation, the most attractive features of the proposed decoupling technique are simplicity and ease of implementation in compact multiantenna devices.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2885457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8567995","Antenna arrays;antenna decoupling;multiple input multiple output (MIMO);tapered slot;universal software radio peripheral (USRP) receiver","Antenna arrays;Antenna measurements;Frequency measurement;Tuning;Current measurement;Slot antennas","","16","","42","IEEE","7 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The MFG utilizes a known short RF line source that can be sequentially moved across the array using an existing crane; RF coupling measurements between this RF line source and the array elements made at different RF line source positions are vector summed, so as to form a known virtual RF line source that stretches the length of the array. A second independent method, SatCal, is presented that uses reflections from orbiting satellites to calibrate the array, either at the subarray or radiating element level. These calibration methods have been demonstrated on a large S-band phased array and have resulted in array calibrations equivalent to within 5°, 0.7 dB rms (element level), or 4°, 0.6 dB rms (subarray level).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2920231","Raytheon Company; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732655","Calibration;phased arrays;radar antennas","Calibration;Phased arrays;Radio frequency;Couplings;Apertures;Satellites","","19","","12","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such joint optimization exploits maximum available degrees-of-freedom under the assumption of uniform amplitude excitations to improve the shaped power pattern synthesis performance, and it leads to a reduced number of elements and simpler feeding network without using unequal power dividers for the array. The copolarization (COP) and cross-polarization patterns for a rotated dipole array are derived in a 2-D case, and then the vectorial shaped pattern synthesis problem is formulated as finding the optimal solution by maximally approaching the desired COP pattern shape under multiple constraints on the sidelobe level (SLL) and cross-polarization level (XPL). In addition, an asymmetric mapping method is incorporated into the proposed joint optimization, so that the minimum element spacing constraint can be also used for the synthesis of planar sparse dipole arrays. The comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) algorithm is adopted to optimize the element positions, rotation angles and phases. A set of synthesis experiments including linear and planar rotated dipole arrays with a different pattern shape requirements are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

The rasorber maintains a low reflectivity, which is less than -10 dB in broadband during the tuning process. An equivalent circuit model is provided as a guideline for the tunable rasorber design. Based on the model, a varactor-tunable rasorber composed of three stacked metallic layers is constructed and investigated. These layers include a frequency selective surface (FSS) loaded with resistors and varactors, a wire grid and a varactor-loaded bandpass FSS. The wire grids in the middle and bottom layers in combination with metallic vias provide the bias and grounding for the varactors, respectively. This configuration avoids using two separated bias networks for varactors on different layers, thus, averting undesirable responses associated with having more bias grids. A tunable rasorber prototype was fabricated and measured, showing that the passband can be tuned from 2.2 to 3.3 GHz by changing bias voltage from 4 to 22 V, with an insertion loss between 6.6 and 3.3 dB. A wide low-reflectivity band under normal incidence for double polarizations from 1.9 to 5.4 GHz is realized. This tunable rasorber has promising applications in broadband stealth facilities with integrated hopping communication functionality.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2916739","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701268,61631012); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LQ17F010003); Ningbo University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8720189","Frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs);periodic structure;rasorber;tunable;varactor","Absorption;Passband;Frequency selective surfaces;Varactors;Broadband antennas;Reflection;Electronic countermeasures","","94","","31","IEEE","22 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a consequence, material properties are a critical factor for the functionality and reliability of systems, like-wise new materials are available in the market. Fourteen interesting materials of different classes [polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), polyphenyl ether (PPE), epoxy-based resin, and liquid crystal polymer (LCP)] were evaluated in this work at their initial state, while heating to 125 °C and after storage with 85% relative humidity (RH) at 85 °C. It is shown that there are new candidates for millimeter wave applications beyond the PTFE materials. Nevertheless, it is necessary to test each material individually for its properties and optimize the parameters in simulation because they differ from the values in the datasheet. In addition, the properties depend on the used line setup, in this work microstrip lines.

The FILT is used to transform the dispersion expressed in a frequency-domain response into a time-domain response, and Prony's method is utilized to extract the parameters and transform the time-domain responses into those in the z-domain so that they can be incorporated into the FDTD method directly. The update equation of the electric field in the FDTD method is then formulated by using the z-transformation. Stability analysis of the proposed scheme is also investigated by means of the root-locus method.

The interior and exterior boundary value problems are coupled to each other through the Robin transmission conditions (RTCs). Both domains are then independently decomposed into subregions to facilitate computation. Specifically, FEM-DDM with the second order transmission conditions (SOTCs) is employed for the interior domain, and BEM-discontinuous Galerkin (BEM-DG) based on the combined field integral equation (CFIE) is applied for the exterior boundary domain. The proposed TDDM allows for nonconformal discretization between any touching subdomains. Without the introduction of a stabilization term that relies on a line integral over intersection of nonmatching meshes and relevant terms involving surface-line integrals, the proposed TDDM provides an effective domain decomposition (DD) preconditioner for the global system.

In this communication, a wideband enhancement method based on a multimode analysis of patch antennas is proposed. By adding suitable shorting loads on the patch, the resonance frequency of the higher order modes TM20, TM30, TM40, and TM50 is decreased and combined with the dominant mode (TM10) one. These live modes provide a wide operating band. Using this bandwidth enhancement method, a compact UWB patch antenna with unidirectional radiation pattern and circular polarization is designed. The size of the patch is only 0.5λ0 × 0.5λ0 and the height is only 0.1λ0 (λ0 is the free space wavelength at the center frequency).

The radiating structure is composed of open slots, stair-shaped strips, and a square patch. Eight open slots are etched on the four corners of the square patch to realize symmetrical radiation and low cross-polarization for orthogonal polarizations. Stair-shaped strips are not only used to excite the open slots, but also introduce the monopole resonance. In addition, patch resonance is excited on the center square patch. For matching these different resonances, shorted microstrip lines are utilized to achieve the wide impedance bandwidth. Moreover, compact stepped impedance resonators are elaborately introduced on the top of the patch to achieve wideband harmonic suppression without any increase of the antenna footprint. The proposed antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured to verify the design method.

The decoupling structure usually requires certain space, which increases the overall antenna size. In this communication, a small π-shaped structure that can be highly integrated into a very compact two-inverted-F-antenna (IFA) system is presented. The two-IFA design occupies a size of 5 mm × 38 mm (about 0.04λ× 0.30λ at 2.4 GHz) with two symmetrical IFAs facing each other by a gap of 2 mm only. Each IFA is capable of covering the 2.4 GHz (2400-2484 MHz) and 5 GHz (5150-5825 MHz) wireless local area network (WLAN) bands. The π-shaped decoupling structure is encircled by the IFAs and comprises two shunt capacitors and a series inductor. By properly selecting the capacitance and the inductance, the isolation between the IFAs in 2.4 GHz band can be largely enhanced. In addition, because of current null arrangements of the 5 GHz band, the proposed design is inherently decoupled over the higher band. The results show that good isolation >16 dB over the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands can be attained. It is also noted that the decoupling bandwidth of the present decoupling structure is narrow.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2925286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753673","Decoupling techniques;notebook computer antennas;printed inverted-F-antennas (IFAs);two-antenna systems;wireless local area network (WLAN) antennas","Antennas;Wireless LAN;Antenna measurements;Strips;Capacitors;Inductors;Metals","","50","","13","IEEE","2 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two different antenna elements, which have similar radiation performances and different reflection phases, are used to form the array. By using different feed and patch structures, both the desired radiation and scattering characteristics of the two antenna elements can be controlled separately. Thus, a similar radiation performance and a 180° reflection phase difference can be obtained simultaneously by adjusting the size of the patches and the length of the slots on the ground plane. The simulation results show that the proposed integrated design array has approximately the same radiation performances as the arrays with uniform elements. In addition, the monostatic RCS of the proposed array is significantly reduced from 4 to 8 GHz, with a maximum reduction value of 23 dB. To validate the simulation results, prototypes of the integrated design antenna array with 4 × 4 elements are fabricated and measured.

By turning them ON or OFF simultaneously, the induced current directions are reversed, thus achieving two phase states with 180° phase difference. The bidirectional radiation is achieved by utilizing the continuity of the cross-polarized electric field on the surface.

This antenna array is composed of two parts: low-loss gap waveguide (GWG) feeding network and high performance magneto-electric (ME) dipole antennas. The antenna elements are fed by the transverse coupling slots right above an air-filled high-mode cavity with checkerboard structure. Moreover, a four-way ridge GWG (RGWG) power divider with transition from RGWG to groove GWG (GGWG) is designed to excite the high-mode cavity. By properly arranging the position and size of coupling slots, each ME dipoles are excited with in-phase property. Periodic pins are arranged around both the GWG transmission line and the air cavity to create a stop band and resonant frequency. The high-mode air cavity is realized using shorted pins to split the electromagnetic field into shorted-end GGWG. Thus, the normal GWG feeding technology with a GWG power divider and a 2 x 2 air cavity in different layers are combined in a single layer. The transmission loss and substrate loss of this metallic single-layer feeding network are reduced, as well as the array profile. Each CP ME dipole antenna is etched on the printed circuit board (PCB) with stable radiation pattern and wide axial ratio (AR) bandwidth performance. The proposed 4 x 8 planar antenna array is simulated and fabricated to validate the design. A measured 3 dB AR bandwidth of 17% and a gain of up to 23 dBi have been achieved.

In this communication, we present an efficient measurement setup that provides scattering measurements with spatial and polarization diversities. The targeted application is foreign object debris (FOD) detection and identification for surveillance of airport runways. Most existing systems are monostatic but rapid advances in mmW technology pushes toward the deployment of multistatic radars on either side of airport runways. In the following, we investigate the contribution of multistatic measurements with a special focus on the reconstruction of glass and brake pad debris, courtesy of DGAC (French civil aviation). We also present an efficient approach for making images of FODs. For this, we process scattered held measurements with an additive (with respect to polarization) backpropagation algorithm. First images include all measured points taken from the upper hemisphere. In order to get closer to the final application, we restrict the held of view to receivers facing the transmitter. Both approaches provide very good shape reconstruction of the glass debris and the central zone of the brake pad. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that full-3-D measurements have been conducted on FODs in the W-band. It is also the first example of a 3-D qualitative image of FOD obtained from measured data in the W-band.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2922746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741149","Electromagnetic diffraction;foreign object debris (FOD);millimeter wave (mmW) imaging;mmW measurements","Antenna measurements;Radar;Scattering;Brakes;Receivers;Three-dimensional displays;Transmitters","","11","","25","IEEE","19 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this technique, a virtual array of receiving (RX) probes by their grid of locations is created to collect the data for further processing by a matrix pencil method (MPM) for determining the characteristics of multipath signals. Then, a reference antenna is employed to produce a calibration matrix factor (CMF) that can be stored in a file and be directly incorporated with the measurement of the radiation of any antenna under test (AUT) to derive its corrected radiation patterns without the need for further calibration by a multifrequency scan.
