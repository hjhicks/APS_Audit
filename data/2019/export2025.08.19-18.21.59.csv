The previous configurations introduced by the authors displayed a residual side lobe imbalance, showing the limitations of elliptical delay lens profiles, derived from a starting bifocal constrained lens. Polynomial profiles are proposed here as a way to enhance the scanning performance and the pattern shape. Optimized configurations demonstrate a reduction in the phase aberration levels over a large scanning range ([-30°, 30°]). The associated radiation patterns demonstrate lower and more balanced first side lobe levels (SLLs) (≅ -18 dB), as compared to the previous elliptical approach (≅ -13.2 dB). A validation has been proposed through the manufacturing and test of a prototype over the downlink Ka-band ([27.5-31] GHz). Excellent radiation performance [half-power beamwidth (HPBW), SLL] has been experimentally obtained over a wide angular range ([-31.5°, 31.5°]), including low scanning loss and high radiation stability over the entire frequency range. High radiation efficiencies are demonstrated with this fully metallic design, particularly suitable for space applications. The mechanical simplicity offered by the concept is also quite attractive for low-cost multi-beam platforms.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2924904","European Space Agency; European Regional Development Fund; Ministry of Higher Education and Research, Brittany and Rennes Métropole, through the CPER Project SOPHIE/STIC & Ondes; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753698","Beamformer;constrained lens;geometrical optics (GO);multiple beam antennas;parallel plate waveguide (PPW);ray tracing","Lenses;Delays;Feeds;Manufacturing;Optical waveguides;Europe;Optimization","","44","","23","IEEE","2 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through existing studies based on the reaction theorem and infinitesimal dipole modeling (IDM), mutual admittance can be intuitively and efficiently calculated. Extending previous studies based on the reaction theorem and IDM, we propose a method for analyzing mutual admittance between antennas that are located in nonplanar skew positions. There are two main ideas in this paper. The first is IDM extraction using a segmented grid on an antenna computer-aided design (CAD). Using the triangular-meshed antenna CAD, the IDM is extracted on a grid which is equal to the antenna shape. The proposed grid scheme improves the modeling accuracy of the IDM compared to the previous grid schemes. The second idea is to apply a rotation matrix to the IDM for efficient calculation of the coupling of any two antennas with nonplanar skew positions. The strength of the proposed method is that it can predict the mutual coupling between the two antennas by using only independent information for each antenna. However, since only the independent information is used for each antenna, it can reflect only the first-order electromagnetic interaction. Therefore, the proposed method is effective only when the distance between the two antennas is sufficiently far so that the two antennas are regarded independent regardless of the distance variation. Coupling analyses based on these two ideas were performed using two types of antennas in two different cases. The results of the coupling analyses were validated through comparison with the method of moment (MoM) results obtained with the FEKO simulation tool.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2925122","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753699","Antenna coupling;infinitesimal dipole modeling (IDM);mutual admittance;rotation matrix;S-parameter","Dipole antennas;Antenna arrays;Admittance;Solid modeling;Antenna measurements;Couplings","","10","","27","IEEE","2 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The inspiration comes from a dipole fed by a differential line which can be considered a DM feed. What will happen if the DM feed is transformed into a CM feed? Some interesting features are provided in this article. By symmetrically placing one DM antenna and one CM antenna together, a DM/CM antenna can be achieved. Benefitting from the coupling cancellation of antiphase currents and the different distributions of the radiation currents, a DM/CM antenna can obtain high isolation and complementary patterns, even if the radiators of the DM and CM antennas are overlapped. Therefore, good MIMO performance can be realized in a very compact volume. To validate the concept, a miniaturized DM/CM antenna unit is designed for mobile phones. The 24.2 dB isolation and complementary patterns are achieved in the dimension of 0.330λ0 × 0.058λ0 × 0.019λ0 at 3.5 GHz. One 8 × 8 MIMO antenna array is constructed by using four DM/CM antenna units and shows good overall performance.

It makes use of the fact that at the center of the DR, the E-field of the HEM11δ mode is weakest but that of the TM01δ mode is strongest. Therefore, increasing the dielectric constant around the central DR region can lower the resonant frequency of the TM01δ mode with no virtual effects on the HEM11δ mode. Using this approach, the frequencies of the HEM11δ and TM01δ modes can be made equal to obtain a pattern-diversity antenna. A cylindrical DRA centrally loaded by a dielectric with a higher dielectric constant is used to realize this idea. Its HEM11δ and TM01δ modes are excited by a rectangular cross slot and an axial coaxial probe, respectively. To demonstrate the idea, a two-port diversity antenna fabricated with two different transparent materials was designed for 2.4 GHz WLAN applications.

In order to attain this objective, the basic microstrip-based 4 × 4 BM is designed, and then modified to a 4 × 6 BM through a dual-substrate structure to avoid crossing lines using microstrip-to-slotline transitions.

In the ternary parallelization approach, a binary clustering tree of all the message passing interface (MPI) processes is built first. Then, the MLFMA tree is categorized into plane wave partitioning, hierarchical-structure partitioning, and box partitioning (BP) levels via a top-down approach to match the process clustering tree. Compared with the bottom-up approach, interprocess communications in the far interaction are reduced. An inner-group transition level is designed for switching partitions on the intermediate level between the hierarchical-structure partitioning and BP levels. The ternary strategy can realize as high parallel efficiency as the hierarchical partitioning strategy while maintaining flexibility in selecting the total number of processes. An auxiliary-tree-based parallel mesh refinement technique and a hybrid octree storage strategy are designed to facilitate the realization of fast full-wave simulation on a scale of over 10 billion unknowns with the ternary MLFMA.

The most distinctive feature of the proposed method is that the continuity of the first-time derivative of the electric field intensity is enforced across the interfaces, unlike the existing formulations in electromagnetics. A theoretical proof is provided to demonstrate that this transmission condition guarantees unconditional stability and energy preservation of the method. Since the condition number of the global interface problem is greatly reduced compared to the standard finite-element time-domain (FETD) method, an iterative solver converges in far fewer iterations. This significantly reduces the simulation time, particularly when implemented on parallel computers. It is numerically shown that the method is scalable with respect to the number of subdomains and the time-step size. The numerical results for simulation of a cavity and bandgap devices are presented to demonstrate capability, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed time-domain DP-FETI (TD-DP-FETI).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2927844","Iran's National Elites Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8764579","Domain decomposition method;finite-element tearing and interconnecting (FETI);finite-element time-domain (FETD) method","Stability analysis;Time-domain analysis;Numerical stability;Antennas;Mathematical model;Power system stability","","4","","35","IEEE","16 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to take the influence of users' motion into account, a mobility model for wearable antennas on dynamic users is used. Signal depolarization mechanisms are identified, and simulations are performed to analyze the influence of user dynamics on the channel. The results show that significant polarization mismatch losses occur due to wearable antenna rotations, resulting in received power variations up to 37.5 dB for the line-of-sight component and 41.4 dB for the scattered one. The importance of taking signal polarization into account is demonstrated by comparing the simulation results between polarized and nonpolarized channel models in a free space propagation scenario, where a difference up to 53 dB in between the two is observed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2925157","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(grant numbers:UID/MULTI/04111/0213,UID/MULTI/04111/0216,UID/EEA/00066/2013,foRESTER PCIF/SSI/0102/2017,IF/00325/2015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753689","Body area networks (BANs);dynamic users;polarized off-body channel;wireless communication","Channel models;Antenna accessories;Diffraction;Geometry;Analytical models;Dynamics","","16","","49","IEEE","2 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, an improved calibration technique for quasi-monostatic polarimetric measurement system is proposed. The scattering mechanism of a rectangular dihedral corner reflector in a quasi-monostatic radar system is analyzed, where the bistatic angle constrains to be within a few degrees. The polarimetric characteristic of the dihedral is evaluated by means of physical optics (POs) approximation. Combining the evaluation formulation with a nonlinear calibration technique, the polarimetric measurement error model can be adapted for the quasi-monostatic geometry so that accurate polarimetric calibration may be accomplished.

First, the direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) of FF sources are estimated using 1-D MUSIC spectrum. Then, the NF components can be extracted by applying the oblique projection technique. By constructing a special NF cumulant matrix and performing vectorization to generate the virtual array signal, the DOAs of NF sources can be estimated by the spatial smoothing MUSIC (SS-MUSIC) algorithm. Finally, with the NF DOA estimates, the range estimates of NF sources are obtained via 1-D peak searching. We also derive the consecutive range of the difference coarray and optimum array configurations for the SDNA, under a given number of sensors. The proposed algorithm exploits the large coarray aperture to enhance the localization performance and can distinguish correctly the types of the sources.

However, the high propagation path loss and the limited output power of the amplifier require highly directive antennas with high antenna gain in order to realize a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). An angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is necessary to adjust the main lobe direction of the antenna. A major challenge of the AoA estimation is the compromise between accuracy and time consumption due to the big number of main lobe directions. This paper proposes a novel efficient AoA algorithm, which utilizes the fact that the power-angular spectrums (PASs) of different frequencies are highly correlated and the THz communication devices are equipped with radio frequency (RF) frontends of lower frequency. By means of a rough and quick estimation at the lower frequency, the range of the true AoA can be significantly confined and the precise estimation can be efficiently carried out. To begin with, an antenna model with discrete main lobe directions is proposed and the relationship between antenna gain, half power beamwidth (HPBW), and number of main lobe directions is analyzed. The PAS correlation is then validated with channel sounding measurement. The two-step AoA estimation algorithm is derived, formulated, and finally validated with hardware demonstration.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2927892","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(grant numbers:645369); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8764569","Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation;channel sounding measurement;directive antenna;power-angular spectrum;terahertz (THz) communication","Directive antennas;Estimation;Gain;Antenna measurements;Adaptive arrays;Propagation losses","","22","","37","IEEE","16 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The performances of the MPA are implemented by resonating its radiative TM10 and TM12 modes at the lower and upper bands, respectively. Initially, the far-zone radiated fields of the MPA working in the TM10 mode are theoretically investigated. It demonstrates that its E-plane half-power beamwidth (HPBW) in the lower band is significantly widened by removing the array factor between dual equivalent slots. After that, the MPA working in TM12 mode is deeply studied and analyzed. The results depict that its wide E-plane HPBW and low H-plane sidelobe level (SLL) in the upper band could be obtained by reshaping radiation patterns of its improved TM12 mode via the shorting pins. Additionally, a linear slot is cut on the core radiator so as to achieve a good impedance matching. With these arrangements, the E-plane HPBW, H-plane SLL, and impedance bandwidth of this designed MPA can be simultaneously enhanced in the dual bands. Finally, the proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. The experimental results show that the antenna has gained an improved bandwidth (|S11| <; -10 dB) ranging from 3.45 to 3.77 GHz and 5.75 to 6.04 GHz with two attenuation poles. Most importantly, the HPBW of its E-plane radiation pattern is successfully widened to around 135° over these dual operating bands.

By proving that asymmetry is a necessary condition in addition to the Hanson-Woodyard condition for traveling-wave endfire radiation, we study the effect of asymmetric corrugation on the mode guide and coupling. We subsequently show that two different waves are independently guided along the two corrugated edges, whose phase difference leads to a transversally polarized dipole moment radiating in the endfire direction. A closed-form expression for the radiation pattern is derived based on the proposed analysis to approximately predict the antennas' optimum length. To verify the proposed analysis and design principles, results from an experimental prototype operating at 13-15 GHz are also provided. The experimental results show that the antenna design has an average gain of 9.9 dBi and an average efficiency of 82%.

A dualmode colocated feeding network is properly integrated with the cross slot, without occupying extra area. Therefore, the overall dimension of the proposed antenna is only 0.293λ0 × 0.293λ0 × 0.008λ0 (λ0 is the free space wavelength at center frequency). A prototype is fabricated and measured to prove the design strategy. In such a compact antenna volume, the -10 dB impedance bandwidths for both orthogonal polarizations are over 6%, with the port isolation better than 30 dB and radiation efficiency over 68%, exhibiting potential applications in space-limited systems, such as access points and portable base stations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2936758","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771280); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:4182029); Tsinghua University(grant numbers:2019Z08QCX16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816668","Antenna diversity;antenna feed;compact dimension;cross slot;dual polarized antenna","Coplanar waveguides;Antenna measurements;Dipole antennas;Slot antennas;Antenna feeds;Substrates","","24","","30","IEEE","27 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed concept utilizes the scanning and nulling capabilities of combined higher order modes of a circular microstrip patch as an antenna element in a seven-element hexagonal array. These elements facilitate providing suitable radiation-matched patterns for wide-scanned angles and simultaneously reducing the grating lobes for large element spacing in the order of one wavelength. In particular, for the scan angles of 35°-75°, two higher order modes, namely the TM21 and TM31, are excited and the grating lobes are reduced to well below -30 dB. The proposed method is also shown to be effective for near the horizon scanning with a $0.8\lambda _{\mathrm {o}}$ element spacing.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2934822","Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems(grant numbers:ECCS-1653915); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805228","Grating lobe;higher-order modes;microstrip patch;phased array antenna","Phased arrays;Microstrip antenna arrays;Gratings;Microstrip;Arrayed waveguide gratings;Antenna radiation patterns","","23","","25","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a circular polarization (CP) reconfigurable endfire antenna element is realized by adopting two pairs of switchable electric dipoles, which have a 180° phase difference inherently. Along with the fixed magnetic dipole, the endfire antenna element can work at two CP states, i.e., left-hand CP (LHCP) and right-hand CP (RHCP) by switching the states of the two electric dipoles. Then, a Bi-SSCP endfire antenna array with polarization diversity is developed by using two identical endfire antenna elements placed back-to-back with a single feeding probe. For verification, prototypes of the designed endfire antenna element and Bi-SSCP endfire antenna array are fabricated and measured. The measured results show reasonable agreement with the simulated ones. The measured overlapped bandwidth for 10 dB return loss and 3 dB axial ratio of the Bi-SSCP endfire antenna array is from 5.7 to 5.9 GHz for the two CP states.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2934900","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471118); Research Program(grant numbers:2017-JCJQ-ZD-041-05); Southeast University(grant numbers:YBJJ1712); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805245","Bidirectional radiation;circular polarization (CP);endfire antenna;p-i-n diode;polarization reconfigurable;same sense","Dipole antennas;Antenna arrays;Broadband antennas;Antenna measurements;Switches;Cavity resonators","","47","","23","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
