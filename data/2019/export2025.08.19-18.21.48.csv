The aim of this paper is to investigate the employability of an implantable antenna to concurrently operate as a radiator and sensor of the dielectric properties of CSF. The antennas exploit narrow slits and gaps as capacitors for sensing the permittivity of CSF. Three antennas are designed based on capacitively loaded loop (CLL), complementary split ring loop (CSRL), and interdigital capacitor loop (IDCL). To investigate if the dielectric properties of CSF are a function of age, in vitro measurements of different CSF from pigs with different ages are measured in the sub-1-GHz band (0.1-1 GHz). The results reveal a strong pairwise correlation exceeding 0.77 for permittivity and 0.83 for conductivity among samples. Hence, the dielectric properties of the CSF do not reflect age-dependence and sensing sensitivity is implicitly not affected by age. Finally, the implantable antennas are fabricated and tested in a realistic environment viz inside a piglet's head and CSF simulants. The shift in the resonance frequency when the permittivity is increased by 14% at 400 MHz ranges between 31-40 MHz with a relative resonance sensitivity between 6% and 8% for the proposed implantable antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2896722","Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8631117","Biological effects of electromagnetic (EM);biological tissues;dielectric measurement;implants;radiation","Antennas;Dielectrics;Dielectric measurement;Permittivity;Conductivity;Probes;Standards","","15","","46","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These limits are defined by the key performance indicators (KPI) of specific antennas, such as the directivity for large aperture antennas or the achievable bandwidth on electrically small antennas. These limits have been obtained considering that the antenna radiates into free space. In this contribution, we develop the fundamental limits for implanted antennas, which thus radiate first into a lossy medium. KPIs assessing the quality of a specific antenna radiating into lossy medium are the total radiated power reaching free space (out of the lossy host medium) and the maximum power density obtained at the surface of the lossy host medium. The fundamental limits for implanted antennas proposed in this paper yield upper bounds for both KPIs and have been obtained considering elementary sources radiating into a spherical phantom. The spherical wave expansion of the electromagnetic fields was used to determine all the fields, and the limits obtained yield a useful upper bound for more complex scenarios.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2891697","Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost(grant numbers:IP-2013-11-3425); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8606957","Fundamental limits;implantable antennas;spherical wave expansion","Manganese;Wireless communication;Antenna theory;Antenna radiation patterns;Density measurement;Power system measurements","","70","","42","IEEE","10 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main contribution on this paper is to verify propagation path calculations with measurement data taken from a volunteer that has sternotomy wires and an aortic valve implant and from a reference volunteer without any implants. Furthermore, the impact of sternotomy wires and the aortic valve implant is confirmed by finite integration technique (FIT) simulations using a tissue layer model. It is shown that additional signal peaks and variations of the channel impulse responses (CIRs) are observed for the medical implant case since both sternotomy wires and aortic valve implant contain highly conductive materials which affect the channel characteristics. In the time domain simulation results, the difference between the channel strength of the implanted and nonimplanted cases varies between 5 and 17 dB within the time range corresponding to the relevant propagation paths. This phenomenon should be taken into account when designing on-body monitoring devices and when choosing sensor node locations to avoid interference due to the additional multipath propagated signal components. On the other hand, knowledge of the impact of the aortic valve implant may be utilized in the design of devices that can monitor the functionality of a valve implant during the heartbeat.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2906492","Oulun Yliopisto; Academy of Finland(grant numbers:318927); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8672082","Aortic valve implant;channel characteristics;intrabody propagation;sternotomy wires;wireless body area networks (WBANs)","Implants;Valves;Wires;Antenna measurements;Sternum;Dipole antennas","","11","","41","IEEE","20 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such cage environments, wireless communication with implanted devices, e.g., neural recording and stimulation is particularly challenging because the metal cage walls form a reverberant cavity with dense multipath. In the case of backscatter communication with the implanted device, the multipath challenge is particularly acute because of the round-trip nature of the backscatter channel. This paper demonstrates the reverberant cavity effect via measurement of the channel transfer function inside a metal cage used for nonhuman primate research in the 902-928 MHz ultrahigh-frequency industrial, scientific, and medical band. A reduced-size ceramic patch antenna developed for the Neurochip neural recording and stimulation device was affixed to a saline tissue proxy, while a commercial air-dielectric patch antenna was affixed to the ceiling of the cage. A measured 3 dB channel bandwidth greater than 6.5 MHz with a port-to-port insertion loss between 14 and 37 dB was achieved at 126 surveyed locations within the cage volume. A 6.25 Mb/s backscatter data uplink using a differential quadrature phase shift keying constellation was successfully validated inside the cage, with effectively 0% packet error rate for all but two of the surveyed locations. The simulation and experimental results show good agreement and reveal that wideband backscatter communication systems can perform well despite the significant multipath inside the reverberant cage environment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2900423","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:EEC-1028725); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648398","Backscatter communication;implanted biomedical devices;neural recording;reverberant cavity","Antennas;Backscatter;Metals;Animals;Antenna measurements;Cavity resonators;Wireless communication","","12","","25","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a technique to improve the performance of systems with a size (inductance)-limited implanted RX coil is explored. Conventionally, only mutual coupling between coils is used to optimize the performance, which constrains the layout/geometry and choice of coils. In the proposed system, mutual coupling, mutual capacitance, and relative polarity can all be used, thereby reducing the constraints on coil layouts. Performance is further enhanced by two additional techniques that maximize the reflected impedance between the RX coils. Three designs (two-coil, conventional three-coil, and the proposed three-coil) are implemented with a 35 mm diameter RX coil, and their performance is measured at 5 MHz with a 1 kQ load resistance. The efficiency of these designs is measured at varying distances (20-60 mm) between the transmitter and RX. The efficiency of the proposed three-coil system at 50 mm separation is 40%, while the implemented conventional three-coil system and the two-coil system are each less than 10%.

However, to date, there is no formal channel path loss (PL) model for the UWB frequency band in the gastrointestinal (GI) scenario due to the huge differences between the proposed studies. There are three main methodologies to characterize the propagation channel, software simulations, and experimental measurements either in phantom or in in vivo animals. Previous works do not compare all the methodologies or present some disagreements with the literature. In this paper, a dedicated study of the PL using the three aforementioned methodologies (simulations, phantoms, and in vivo measurements) and a comparison with previous studies in the literature is performed. Moreover, numerical values for a PL model which agrees with the three methodologies and the literature are proposed.

The literature concerning performance analysis of radio frequency-based localization techniques for in-body applications at UWB frequencies is very limited. Available studies mainly rely on finite-difference time-domain simulations, using digital human models and on experimental measurements by means of homogeneous phantoms. Nevertheless, no realistic analysis based on multilayer phantom measurements or through in vivo experiment has been reported yet. This paper investigates the performance of the received signal strength-based approach for 2-D and 3-D localizations in the UWB frequency band. For 2-D localization, experimental laboratory measurements using a two-layer phantom-based setup have been conducted. For 3-D localization, data from a recently conducted in vivo experiment have been used. Localization accuracy using path loss models, under ideal and non-ideal channel estimation assumptions, is compared. Results show that, under nonideal channel assumption, the relative localization error slightly increases for the 2-D case but not for the in vivo 3-D case. Impact of receivers selection on the localization accuracy has also been investigated for both 2-D and 3-D cases.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2916629","European Union’s H2020 through the MSCA:ITN Program “Wireless in-Body Environment Communication—WiBEC”(grant numbers:675353); Universitat Politècnica de València(grant numbers:PAID-01-16); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad(grant numbers:TEC2014-60258-C2-1-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718484","Heterogeneous phantom;in-body localization;in vivo measurements;ultrawideband (UWB);wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE)","Phantoms;In vivo;Antenna measurements;Endoscopes;Frequency measurement;Three-dimensional displays;Distance measurement","","36","","38","IEEE","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By using the characteristic modal analysis initially, the ground plane has been miniaturized and optimized to radiate an omnidirectional beam in the horizontal plane with the excitation of the λ/4 resonant mode. The higher order band at 5.8 GHz has been realized by the excitation of the 3λ/4 resonant mode of the same L-shaped slot. These two odd-order modes radiate horizontally polarized omnidirectional patterns. The combination of the vertical polarization generated from the top-loaded patch antenna along with the 3λ/4 mode from the L-shaped slot resulted into omnidirectional CP in the 5.8 GHz band. Furthermore, enhancement in axial ratio bandwidth is achieved with the addition of dielectric superstrate over the feed layer.

This paper presents the design of a low-cost inkjet-printed dipole antenna on flexible Kapton substrate for a 2.45 GHz radio frequency identification (RFID) dosimeter tag. The tag is to be used in a lossy blood environment, which can severely affect antenna radiation performance. To mitigate this, the concept of artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) unit cells is investigated for best impedance and gain performance. When integrated with a dipole radiator, the fabricated AMC-backed antenna maintains broadside radiation with gains of 4.1-4.8 dBi under planar and bending conditions, and on a lossy blood bag. In a rectenna configuration, the antenna can power sensors for ranges up to 1 m. Measured output dc voltages up to 1.7 V are achieved across a 25 kQ resistor.

Particularly, simulation results clarify that the proposed method allows estimating the directions of multiple targets even if the number of the targets exceeds the degree of freedom of receiver antennas. In addition, it is emphasized that the direction estimation by the proposed method is robust against the coherence among the incoming signals.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2916482","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:JP17K00413); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718006","Doppler sensor;parameter estimation;periodic signals;vital sensing","Sensors;Estimation;Doppler effect;Signal resolution;Spatial resolution;Receiving antennas","","2","","12","IEEE","17 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna is matched with an inhomogeneous human head allowing higher signal penetration so as to obtain more meaningful data reflected from inside the brain. Utilizing a folded inverted F-like structure and a slot-loaded ground plane, the antenna is a compact 0.23 λ×0.23 λ×0.04 λ in size with respect to the lowest operating frequency. The antenna is backed with a rectangular cavity to minimize sidelobe and backlobe radiation. The cavity and folded antenna configuration achieve a highly directional radiation pattern toward the head with a front-to-back ratio of more than 17 dB. A curved inhomogeneous human head phantom is fabricated to validate the antenna performance for medical diagnosis applications. An operational frequency band from 1 to 1.7 GHz is achieved with the antenna attached to the surface of the phantom. Less than 0.0147 W/kg SAR is achieved throughout the operating frequency range, which is lower than the state of the art for comparable antennas. The salient characteristics of the proposed antenna make it a suitable candidate for microwave diagnosis of the human head.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2908066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675941","Compact antenna;human head;inverted F antenna (IFA);microwave imaging;near-field radiation;specific absorption rate (SAR)","Microwave antennas;Head;Microwave imaging;Microwave theory and techniques;Bandwidth;Nonhomogeneous media","","62","","34","IEEE","28 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna is designed to fulfill the multislice (level) scanning requirements of electromagnetic imaging systems for thorax imaging. To overcome the need for positioning of several antenna arrays, and hence eliminate the mutual coupling related complications, a square loop antenna with reconfigurable pattern is designed. To create a unidirectional radiation, the loop is loaded with capacitive gaps, which convert its radiation mechanism to that of two virtual dipole arrays with quadrature phase excitation. By utilizing this feature, the location of the gaps is varied on the loop's structure to form virtual dipole arrays in different directions, thus rotating the radiation pattern without physically moving the structure of the antenna. As a proof of concept, six gaps were created on the loop and each gap is loaded with a p-i-n diode to electronically switch between the positions of the designed gaps, thus enabling changing the radiation direction. The proposed antenna can achieve a compact size of 0.32λ × 0.32λ × 0.002λ (λ is the wavelength of the lowest resonance of the antenna) and a wide fractional bandwidth of 32% at 0.8-1.15 GHz, with a peak gain and front-to-back ratio of 2.1 dBi and 8 dB, respectively. The antenna is successfully tested on a thorax imaging platform to detect small volume of water (5 mL) inside lungs as an emulation of early pulmonary edema.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2889164","Advanced Queensland Research Fellowships(grant numbers:2017000204); Queensland Government(grant numbers:2017003038); University of Queensland(grant numbers:2017003135); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585052","Electromagnetic imaging (EMI);loop antenna;pattern reconfigurable antenna;unidirectional antenna;virtual dipole array;wideband antenna","Dipole antennas;Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Thorax;Imaging;Loaded antennas","","25","","26","IEEE","21 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Novel Flexible Electrotextile 3T MRI RF Coil Array for Carotid Artery Imaging: Design, Characterization, and Prototyping","D. Zhang; Y. Rahmat-Samii","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"12 Aug 2019","2019","67","8","5115","5125","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most powerful imaging modality in clinics and is essential for the diagnosis of strokes through carotid artery imaging. The limiting factor for high-quality MRI is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance of the radio frequency (RF) coils. The current RF surface coils, however, are made of rigid or semiflexible materials with very limited bending properties. As a result, their SNR is limited because they cannot be placed very close to the imaging area, thus receiving noises from parts of the human body, which are not intended to be imaged. Taking advantage of the computerized embroidery and laser cutting technology, in this paper, we utilize electrotextile to design, fabricate, and measure multilayer RF coil array system for 3 Tesla (3T) MRI to improve the SNR performance. The proposed RF coil array system provides an ergonomic and high-performance solution to the 3T MRI systems. A roadmap to systematically design electrotextile RF coil arrays is proposed. RF coil array is characterized to have the accurate resonant frequency, good impedance matching, and low mutual coupling. In addition, magnetic field distribution, bending effects, and human body effects are also discussed. A systematic method to characterize the performance of the electrotextile pattern is studied and used to assist the development and performance characterization. Finally, the high resolution and high SNR images of various kinds of phantoms are obtained using the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Antenna Lab electrotextile coil array after its integration with the 3T MRI scanners at UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine Translational Research Imaging Center. Compared with the conventional surface coil, more than 10 dB SNR increase is observed at the depth of 0.5 cm and 3 dB increase at the depth of 3 cm.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2891700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8606145","Coil;embroidered;e-textile;flexible antenna;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);radio frequency (RF);signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)","Radio frequency;Magnetic resonance imaging;Signal to noise ratio;Neck;Carotid arteries;Antennas","","24","","27","IEEE","9 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
