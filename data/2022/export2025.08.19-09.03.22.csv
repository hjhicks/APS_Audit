As a modern data-driven optimization and applied regression methodology, ML aims to provide increasing levels of automation in the knowledge engineering process, replacing much time-consuming human activity with automatic techniques that improve accuracy and/or efficiency by discovering and exploiting regularities in training data. Indeed, many ML and data-driven methods, such as conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs), were introduced and studied within electromagnetics a few decades ago. However, these past studies did not benefit from the most recent advances in ML, which have been driven by the present confluence of improved hardware performance at lower cost, advanced network algorithms and architectures, data science, and considerable efforts dedicated to advancing the computational electromagnetics (CEM) benchmark. Today, a broader family of ML techniques based on ANNs has been developed. Examples include deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network, generative adversarial network, and deep reinforcement learning, which have been successfully applied to different engineering and science problems, ranging from image and video recognition, social media services, virtual personal assistant to autonomous vehicles, to name a few. This naturally suggests that applying ML to real-world electromagnetic problems could be one of the emerging trends in ML and artificial intelligence (AI) [1]–[4]. Indeed, ML has been becoming an important complement to existing experimental, computational, and theoretical aspects of electromagnetics.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3189963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843844","","Special issues and sections;Machine learning;Antennas;Antenna arrays;Electromagnetics;Artificial intelligence;Modeling;Neural networks","","22","","14","IEEE","27 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently ML-based antenna optimization provides a distinct candidate and attracts considerable attention. However, the large number of training samples generated through time-consuming EM simulations becomes a significant challenge. In this article, an efficient online data-driven enhanced-XGBoost (E-XGBoost) method for antenna optimization is proposed, which is mainly composed of two parts, i.e., an input variable filter module (IVFM) and an antenna optimization module (AOM). Specifically, IVFM serves as a variable sensitivity analyzer, which is accomplished by E-XGBoost to efficiently reduce the dimension of design variable and hence save the training samples. Next, the design variables obtained by IVFM are fed into AOM to find the near-optimal solution. In AOM, an online learning strategy is proposed to train a local E-XGBoost model to evaluate the population in the metaheuristic optimization algorithm (MOA). Compared to the global ML model that can mimic the entire design space, this local E-XGBoost model can further cut down the training samples. To verify the performance of the proposed method, several different antenna examples, i.e., U-slot patch antenna, Fabry–Perot resonant antenna, and dual-polarized cross dipole antenna and 5G MIMO antenna array, are simulated. Numerical results support the proposed method in terms of its superior performance and potential advantage of saving computational overhead.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3157895","National Nature Science Foundation(grant numbers:61876143); Aeronautical Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:20200020081001); Fundamental Research project(grant numbers:173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9735150","Metaheuristic optimization algorithm (MOA);online learning;variable selection;XGBoost","Optimization;Antennas;Training;Sensitivity;Input variables;Computational modeling;Statistics","","34","","36","IEEE","15 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, this method is applied to antenna design and worst case performance (WCP) searching under a practical manufacturing tolerance. In the conventional Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based MLAO method, a lower confidence bound (LCB) prescreening strategy with an empirical LCB constant is used to weigh the predicted value and predicted uncertainty. Using a variable-fidelity machine learning method, an adaptive LCB variable, and a retraining and repredicting method, the proposed MB-MLAO method can strike a delicate balance between exploitation and exploration in searching.

This is an efficient methodology to tackle computational challenges, as it is capable of handling a large number of design parameters and is more efficient as well as informative. The proposed technique is applied for modeling the gain performance in the principal plane of a monopole antenna when its radiation properties are modified by placing spatially dependent dielectric material around it. Using the proposed methodology, the dielectric constant values are mapped to the gain pattern of the design. We use two ML techniques for this purpose, namely Gaussian process (GP) regression and artificial neural network (ANN). Once each of these models is obtained, they are further used for estimating the dielectric constant values that can suggest optimal directions to modify gain patterns for single-beam and multiple-beam patterns rather than the conventional omnidirectional pattern of a monopole antenna. The performance of this technique is compared with heuristic optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GAs). The proposed method proves to be quite accurate in spite of being a high-dimensional nonlinear problem. A prototype of a monopole design with three-beam gain pattern is fabricated and tested. The measurement results agree well with the simulation results.

Prior knowledge, including well-known fundamental electromagnetic theorems and experience in antenna design, is purposely applied at the early stage of the proposed method to strategically guide and speed up the synthesis. The proposed intelligent method provides the design of pixelated metacells with high degrees of freedom so that the key performance of the synthesized metacells exceeds the existing limit of conventional design methods by generating a rich profusion of cell patterns. For example, the synthesized triple-layer metacell achieves the −1 dB phase shift range of 330° breaking the limit of 308° derived by existing techniques. The proposed synthesis method also provides the additional capability to flexibly control the phase shift not only at the center frequency but also over a frequency range of interest.

However, the CFM method can only get the strongly tapered feeding power distribution. This will lead to most of power amplifiers (PAs) working in low efficiency states and reduce the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) with the limited power consumption. In this work, combining the radiation efficiency and the PA efficiency, the radiated power efficiency (RPE) is defined as the new design goal and is to be raised to achieve higher EIRP. For this reason, a method based on the near-field pattern synthesis is proposed. In this method, all the ON-state PAs are required to work in the highest efficiency state. Then, with well-trained support vector machine (SVM), the ON–OFF states of the PAs are adjusted so that the reflected focal field can be better synthesized by the near-field pattern of the feed array. Thus, the loss of the radiation efficiency is minimized. As a result, the RPE is about 22% higher than that of the CFM method and about 10% higher than that of the optimum CFM truncation case.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111506","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1801505); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U19A2056,61631012,62101109); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021TQ0058,2021M690026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9539036","Array-fed reflector antenna;near-field pattern synthesis;radiated power efficiency (RPE);support vector machine (SVM)","Manganese;Support vector machines;Antenna radiation patterns;Reflector antennas;Power distribution;Transmitting antennas;Antenna feeds","","10","","38","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To ensure reliable operation, efficient and timely fault diagnosis of APAs on-site is crucial. To date, fault diagnosis has relied on measurement of frequency domain radiation patterns using costly equipment and multiple strictly controlled measurement probes, which are time consuming, complex, and therefore infeasible for on-site deployment. This article proposes a novel method exploiting a deep neural network (DNN) tailored to extract the features hidden in the baseband in-phase and quadrature signals for classifying the different faults. It requires only a single probe in one measurement point for fast and accurate diagnosis of the faulty elements and components in APAs. Validation of the proposed method is done using a commercial 28 GHz APA. Accuracies of 99% and 80% have been demonstrated for single- and multi-element failure detection, respectively. Three different test scenarios are investigated: ON-OFF antenna elements, phase variations, and magnitude attenuation variations. In a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 4 dB, stable fault detection accuracy above 90% is maintained.

A new, more feasible training algorithm is proposed for the efficient development of the DHNN model. The algorithm adopts the design-of-experiment (DOE) sampling technique and is specifically designed for the simulation of multiphysics responses. The strong approximation ability of the DHNN can lead to high-accuracy modeling with fewer training data and less resource consumption. Another advantage of this approach is that the modeling process is more concise and easier to apply compared with other modeling technologies.

Due to the narrow guard band between Wi-Fi 6 (5.15–5.83 GHz) and Wi-Fi 6E (5.92–7.125 GHz), the mutual coupling near common edge frequencies cannot be sufficiently suppressed by existing filters. To mitigate the mutual coupling over the guard band of a symmetrical two-port MSA, the common-mode (CM)/differential-mode (DM) cancellation theory was utilized. Then, the operating frequencies of two ports were tuned to Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E bands, without deteriorating the original decoupling performance. Finally, two filters were loaded to realize high isolation over the whole working bandwidth. For the demonstration, a prototype was fabricated and measured. The measured results show that the proposed two-port MSA achieves the impedance bandwidth of 5.49–5.9 and 5.89–7.14 GHz and the isolation over 20 dB across the whole band.

The principle relies on the perturbation of the ground plane symmetry with merely one microstrip dipole placed near the edge of the substrate. Chipless RFID tags are realized using three different shapes of the substrate (square, octagonal, and circular) to achieve multiple edges. The measurements are performed in a semianechoic and office environment with tag attached to objects (cardboard box and metallic plate). The measured results of the square chipless RFID tags present magnitude variations (< 10 dB) but are detectable over a full 360° even in real environment yielding an “orientation-insensitive” detection system.

This study takes the first step to cope with the orientation mismatch against arbitrary roll, pitch, and yaw angles. The proposed technique requires the design of tag and new reader architecture, eliminating complex signal processing. The tag comprises resonators with the pattern of a short dipole. Two reader antennas are placed orthogonally and fed with equal power, illuminating co-polarized electromagnetic waves toward the tag. Based on the Pythagorean trigonometric identity, the sum of the backscattering power is unvarying against the rotations in pitch or yaw. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a 6.97 bit system. When orientation mismatch in yaw appears, the proposed scheme improves the read reliability from 54.3% to 93.5%.

Here, we propose a strategy of a CP Cassegrain meta-antenna by combining a planar helical antenna, a metasurface main reflector, and a metamaterial subreflector. The main reflector is designed to achieve focusing for CP waves at 13 GHz. The subreflector is chessboard-configured chiral metamaterial slab composed of two different types of chiral meta-atoms, aiming to achieve spin- and direction-selective CP transmissions and reflections. The distance between two reflectors is half of focal length, which enables our antenna to be dubbed as a folded reflectarray. The low radar cross section (RCS) is achieved based on scattering cancellation technique by realizing near 180° reflection phase difference between two neighboring chessboard submeta-atoms. Thanks to the architecture of the two reflectors, the proposed antenna exhibits high gain and low profile simultaneously according to image theory. For verification, a planar CP Cassegrain antenna, excited by a left-handed CP (LCP) planar helical antenna, is numerically studied, fabricated, and experimentally measured. Numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones, showing a peak right-handed CP (RCP) gain of 26.6 dBi at 12.6 GHz. Furthermore, the backward monostatic RCS of the antenna is dramatically reduced over −10 dB in a broad bandwidth from 8.4 to 15.7 GHz when it is illuminated by an LCP planar wave. Our proposed Cassegrain antenna features simultaneously broadband, high gain, low profile, and low RCS, providing a new avenue to low-profile CP reflectarrays with invisibility.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161394","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171459); National Defense Foundation of China(grant numbers:2019-JCJQ-JJ-081); Youth Talent Lifting Project of the China Association for Science and Technology(grant numbers:17-JCJQ-QT-003); Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020JZ-33); Key Principal's Fund of Air Force Engineering University(grant numbers:XNLX19030601); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743724","Cassegrain antenna;chiral metamaterials;high gain;metasurface;radar cross section (RCS) reduction","Focusing;Reflector antennas;Metasurfaces;Antennas;Metamaterials;Antenna measurements;Scattering","","12","","35","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The innovative unit cell design provides an extra degree of freedom in varying the geometries of the array elements in all three dimensions, which enables us to independently control the phases of the two LP waves.

Closed-form expressions are obtained for the line current locations and amplitudes when the plane-wave parameters have periodic amplitudes and propagation vectors. A corresponding wire-impedance solution is derived that employs thin-wire approximations and takes into account all multiple interactions between wires. Remarkably, this solution holds even when the required impedance values are nonperiodic. The plane-wave parameters within one period determine the period of the impedance values and, thus, determine how many different types of loaded wires are required. For general nonperiodic plane-wave parameters, the line-source locations and amplitudes can be determined from an FFT approach involving a complex-contour integral, and the corresponding wire impedances can be computed numerically.

The model is derived analytically, the space-/frequency-domain manipulations are achieved by designing the dimension and time sequence of I and Q paths. In the specular reflection direction, an objective frequency shift of the reflected first-order harmonic can be obtained. While, in other directions, the opposite first-order harmonic can be easily controlled by changing the dimension of I/Q paths, and the objective first-order harmonic remains unchanged. Furthermore, with a small dimension of I/Q paths, the first-order harmonic can be used for beam scanning by predesigning the start time of the modulation element. To realize the space-time-modulated metasurface with the required periodically time-varying responses, 2 bit unit cells loaded with dynamically switchable pin diodes are used as I/Q modulation.

To improve the optical transmittance of metasurface, the top layer of the coding elements adopts the metal rings with ultrathin linewidth with the optical transmittance of above 97% theoretically, whereas the bottom layer adopts hexagonal ring mesh metallic film with the optical transmittance of 95.4% and high electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness.

Initially, a dual-band dual-polarized bandpass frequency-selective surface (FSS), consisting of a composite array of two independent ACPRs subelements, is presented to obtain the desired transmission properties for vertically and horizontally polarized incident waves. The equivalent circuit model is then introduced to analyze the proposed FSS, exhibiting that transmission magnitude properties of vertically and horizontally polarized transmitted waves can be independently designed within these two passbands. Furthermore, two pairs of rectangular slots are introduced in the patches of these ACPRs subelements and extensively investigated to demonstrate that versatile phase differences between vertically and horizontally polarized transmitted waves with equal magnitude can be achieved. Based on this concept, within these two passbands, a right- or left-hand circularly polarized (RHCP or LHCP) transmitted wave is then attained by designing the vertical and horizontal components of a 45° tilted LP incident wave with equal magnitudes and ±90° phase difference, thus leading to dual-band LP-to-CP polarization conversions. To validate the design concept, two prototypes of dual-band circular polarizers with orthogonally and identically LP-to-CP conversions in each operation band are designed, fabricated, and measured. Experimental results have well revealed that our proposed structure has a few attractive advantages of ultrathin profile, low axial ratio, and flexible designs in LP-to-CP conversions and frequency band ratios.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3145432","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFE0205900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071243,61971475); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under FDCT Grant(grant numbers:0085/2020/AMJ,0095/2019/A2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696212","Aperture-coupled patch resonators (ACPRs);circular polarizer;dual-band polarizer;frequency-selective surface (FSS)","Frequency selective surfaces;Dual band;Resonators;Integrated circuit modeling;Apertures;Passband;Equivalent circuits","","12","","28","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the lossy case, both the orthogonality of the characteristic far fields and the weight operator orthogonality of the modal currents are satisfied with respect to the Hermitian inner products only for sufficiently symmetric geometries, such as a sphere. For irregular lossy shapes, independent of the symmetry of the formulation, the far-field orthogonality can be obtained only with respect to the symmetric (non-Hermitian) product. The weight operator orthogonality can be satisfied with (complex) symmetric formulations, but again only with respect to the symmetric product. Since the symmetric products are not related to any physical power quantity, the modes do not form a (radiated) power orthogonal set in the lossy case.

Due to the destructive interference involved at greater oblique angles, reflective polarizers experience severe degradation of 90% PCR BW response.

A distinctive geometric feature of the pyramid is that its vertex is the point in common with four of its faces, while the other canonical elements have vertices in common with three edges and three faces, and that is why pyramids’ vector bases have hitherto been obtained with complex procedures. Here, we present a much simpler and more straightforward procedure by shifting to a new paradigm that requires mapping the pyramidal cell into a cube and then directly enforcing the conformity of the vector bases with those used on adjacent differently shaped cells (tetrahedra, hexahedra, and triangular prisms).

At the same time, the antenna parameter tuning should be oriented toward improving the performance figures pertinent to both electrical (e.g., input matching) and field properties (e.g., axial ratio bandwidth) as much as possible. Identification of available tradeoffs between the robustness and nominal performance can be realized through multi-objective optimization (MO), which is an intricate and computationally expensive task. This article proposes a novel technique for fast tolerance-aware MO of antenna structures. The key component of the presented methodology is a feature-based regression surrogate, established based on the characteristic points of antenna responses extracted from its electromagnetic (EM)-simulation data, and employed for a rapid estimation of the maximum allowed input tolerance levels for given values of performance parameters of interest. Subsequent tradeoff designs are generated by tuning the antenna parameters for various assumed values of relevant figures of interest (e.g., the operating bandwidth). As demonstrated using three microstrip antennas, a rendition of performance-robustness tradeoff designs can be accomplished at the cost of just about forty (for six-parameter antenna) to about 80 (for 14-parameter antenna) per design EM analyses of the respective structure. The reliability of the approach is validated through direct EM-driven Monte Carlo analysis of the selected designs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3145462","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:2066060); National Science Centre of Poland(grant numbers:2018/31/B/ST7/02369); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696206","Antenna optimization;EM-driven design;fabrication tolerances;multi-objective design;response features;surrogate modeling","Antennas;Robustness;Bandwidth;Optimization;Computational modeling;Fabrication;Antenna accessories","","22","","56","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The notable advantage of the PS basis is its radiated fields can be expressed in closed-form. The proposed approach therefore circumvents the need to use Green’s function in formulating the integral equations. Combined with a simple testing procedure, the matrix filling time is reduced and the concern of singularity is removed. To further reduce the computational complexity and enhance the performance, a characteristic basis function method (CBFM) is implemented and embellished with a new characteristic basis function (CBF) generation strategy. Specifically, a cubical surface bounding the entire target is first specified and discretized. A set of auxiliary sources are then defined in a manner similar to that done for a scattering body. These auxiliary sources are defined once and shared by different blocks.

Also, the theoretical channel model of artificial plasma cloud is established by using its space–time evolution and atmospheric wind field parameters. Considering common modulation modes and receiver noise levels, the potential communication performance is evaluated by using the proposed channel model, such as the transmission rate, the bit error rate (BER), and the available time for building up and maintaining communication links. It is shown that the maximal communication rate is up to 200 kb/s, BER overall maintains below 10−7, and the available time for a single release is about 30–60 min; for the case of this article, they are release mass of 2–10 kg, communication distances of 400–1200 km, and radio frequencies of 30–70 MHz at the VHF band. This demonstrates that the artificial channel can propagate radio waves at a much higher frequency, wider bandwidth, and higher rate than those of HF communication. Hopefully, it could be a solution to overcome the intolerable shortcoming and adverse effects on HF communication due to ionospheric disturbances especially in cases of maritime, emergency, and minimum communications","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161445","Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ts20190968); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61871352,42074225); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743607","Artificial plasma cloud;ionosphere;over-the-horizon;radio communication;wireless channel","Plasmas;Clouds;Scattering;Mathematical models;Ionosphere;Metals;Rockets","","5","","24","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key to the success of these systems is accurate and reliable propagation models that will simultaneously maximize the number of users able to access the spectrum and minimize the interference to incumbent or protected users. The classical propagation models currently utilized by these systems—the irregular terrain model (ITM) and extended hata (eHata)—do not account for features, such as foliage or endpoint clutter that can have a large impact on propagation loss. This article presents a measurement-based framework for updating these classical models and proposes a new integrated terrain and clutter model using publicly available geographic information system datasets. Over 400 000 path loss measurements were recorded in nine diverse locations across the United States at 1.7 and 3.5 GHz. Our updates improved the rms difference between measurements and model by 3–7 dB for ITM and 3–14 dB for eHata. In addition, we demonstrate several integrated terrain and clutter models that have rms differences ranging from 9.5 to 17.8 dB. Finally, cross validation was used to demonstrate the generalizability of our models to a wide variety of propagation environments.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161496","Defense Spectrum Organization and the NTIA Office of Spectrum Management; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743665","Radio spectrum management;radiowave propagation;radiowave propagation modeling;spectrum sharing","Loss measurement;Clutter;Predictive models;Frequency measurement;Data models;Antenna measurements;Analytical models","","11","","51","USGov","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, the performance of this type of radar is highly dependent on the ionosphere. Reliable models of the radar ground backscatter are required to accurately assess the ionospheric propagation conditions and, thus, the expected performance of OTHRs. The ground backscatter coefficient characterizes the amount of radiation scattered back from a surface toward a receiver per unit area. While the backscatter coefficient of the sea is well understood and may be calculated from theory if the sea state is known, the backscatter coefficient of land at high frequencies is not well understood. To calculate the land backscatter coefficients over Northern Australia, a methodology that compares observed backscatter ionograms to those synthesized using high-frequency (HF) radio wave ray-tracing techniques through model ionospheres was developed. Maps of the backscatter coefficients across Northern Australia were produced. The effects of surface properties, including topography, soil moisture, and vegetation cover on the backscatter coefficients, were investigated. A weak positive correlation between the backscatter coefficient and the soil moisture and surface roughness was observed; however, it was found that the vegetation had the largest effect on the backscatter coefficient.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161534","Defence Science and Technology Group; The University of Adelaide; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743686","Backscatter coefficient;backscatter sounder (BSS);high-frequency (HF) radar;over-the-horizon radar (OTHR)","Backscatter;Radar;Surface topography;Sea surface;Australia;Surface waves;Ionosphere","","5","","45","CCBY","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they are subject to increased system size and misalignment of the TX/RX radiation patterns. In this article, a portable 5.8 GHz dual circularly polarized (CP) interferometric radar sensor is presented, which leverages the proposed dual CP common-aperture antenna that reduces the size of the entire radar system. The common-aperture nature gets rid of the radiation pattern misalignment and ensures that the object can be in the optimal boresight direction. Cross polarization, i.e., right-hand CP (RHCP) for TX and left-hand CP (LHCP) for RX or vice versa, was employed based on the sequentially rotated array (SRA), which not only improves the TX–RX isolation but also adapts with the polarization change in radar sensing. Moreover, a near-field cancellation technique was proposed to further increase the TX–RX isolation in the small form factor. A portable 5.8 GHz radar sensor integrated with the proposed dual CP antenna was custom-designed. Compared to the conventional two-antenna architecture, the proposed radar sensor is reduced in size by 140% but can still achieve a high TX–RX isolation of >60 dB at 5.8 GHz. Experiments were carried and the results illustrate that the proposed radar sensor has high micrometer accuracy in detecting the predefined displacement motions and is able to precisely track the human vital signs in the office environment.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3142303","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFA0715303); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2021SHZDZX0102); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61831016,62171277); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686642","Antenna;circularly polarized (CP);displacement;Doppler radar;interferometry;isolation","Radar antennas;Radar;Sensors;Antennas;Surface waves;Signal to noise ratio;Receiving antennas","","23","","25","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At each point, only one tangential component of the magnetic field is measured, and the other component is estimated numerically using an interpolation technique. Here, an adaptive data acquisition technique is proposed that sequentially collects samples from the field in the areas with highly dynamic behavior and skips the regions that have smooth near-field variations. Since the newly introduced points at each iteration of the algorithm are not necessarily laid on the probe locations of the RFX2, the values of the data at these points are calculated using an interpolation method. The proposed adaptive algorithm in this work requires remarkably fewer samples to reach the same accuracy as uniform sampling. This method is also utilized in spherical NF measurement over  $\theta $  and  $\phi $  plane.

The wide bandwidth achievement for avoiding the detuning challenges is constrained by device specifications and antenna miniaturization. This study presents an ultra-miniaturized antenna of only 10.66 mm3 volume with an ultra-wide bandwidth of 3040 MHz (0.79–3.83 GHz) for a leadless pacemaker (LP). The proposed antenna encompasses the five important bands: ISM (868–868.6 MHz, 902–928 MHz, and 2.4–2.48 GHz), Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS) (1395–1400 MHz), and the midfield (1.45–1.6 GHz) bands. To consider a practical operating scenario, the antenna was integrated with a battery and controlling electronics of an LP. In a homogeneous heart phantom (HHP), the proposed antenna showed a higher gain of −28.7, −20.02, and −16.7 dBi at 915 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 2.45 GHz, respectively. The specific absorption rate (SAR) evaluation in the heart of a realistic model guaranteed patient safety by satisfying the IEEE C95.1-2005 and C95.1-1999 guidelines. The antenna is experimentally validated through measurements in minced pork. The strength of the received signal in the measurements confirms a stable biotelemetric link of the proposed ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna with an external monitoring system.

In this design, four controllable radiation nulls are obtained by utilizing split rings, slotted T-shaped branches, a single-stub tuner, and a parasitic loop. Split rings are first used as the dipole arms to obtain the first radiation null at upper out-of-band. Four T-shaped branches working as DGS are printed under the crossed dipoles to achieve the second radiation null. The connected outer conductors of the differential feed structure acting as a single-stub tuner can provide the third radiation null to further enhance the upper band rejection. Finally, a parasitic loop is incorporated around the split rings, and the out-of-band rejection of the lower band is further enhanced by the fourth radiation null. More importantly, the impedance bandwidth of the antenna can be expended with two newly introduced resonant modes. As a result, a compact filtering antenna with a wide operational bandwidth of 1.7–3.01 GHz (56%) is realized for  $\vert \text{S}_{dd11}\vert < -15$  dB with the isolation higher than 38 dB.

The conformal metasurface consists of multiple curved rectangular waveguides loaded with metamaterial elements—electrically small apertures—inserted into the upper conducting walls of the waveguides. Each element radiates energy into free space to contribute to an overall radiation pattern. Thus, the geometry or electrical configuration of each of the elements needs to be tailored to generate a desired pattern. Generally, due to difficulties in modeling the effect of curvature, the design of conformal metasurface arrays has relied on full-wave simulations or experiments. In this study, we propose a design method utilizing the semianalytical model of a planar metasurface accounting for metamaterial elements’ locations and orientations over a curved surface. Although approximate, we demonstrate that the alteration along with the framework of dipolar modeling of planar elements can be used for the analysis of conformal arrays with small curvature. We then design a conformal array metasurface using the method combined with the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) optimizer.

Element-level decomposition decouples Maxwell equations on a discretization element from those on its neighboring elements using equivalent currents defined on their faces. For any element inside the computation domain, the equivalent currents are obtained from fields in the neighboring elements. For any element on the boundary of the computation domain, the equivalent currents are obtained using the fields generated by TDBI. To generate these fields, TDBI “radiates” equivalent currents on a Huygens surface enclosing the scatterer. This approach when combined with a leapfrog-type time updates results in a fully explicit numerical scheme that allows ELDDM and TDBI to use different time steps. Numerical results that demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to concave and disconnected scatterers are presented.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3142319","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFA0709800); Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology(grant numbers:20501130500); NSFC(grant numbers:62071290); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR)(grant numbers:2019-CRG8-4056); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686588","Boundary integral (BI) method;domain decomposition;explicit method;time-domain finite-element method (TDFEM)","Finite element analysis;Time-domain analysis;Integral equations;Electromagnetic scattering;Transmission line matrix methods;Magnetic domains;Couplings","","6","","29","CCBY","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a complex communication system, this can be used to switch between the detection and stealth modes. The antenna system is formed by combining a liquid absorber with a  $2\times $  2 slot antenna array. The liquid absorber consists of a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) container, 45% ethanol layer, and metal ground, which is attached to the surface of the slot antenna array. The incident wave can be absorbed by the absorber rather than reflected in other directions when the PMMA container is filled with ethanol, which reduces the monostatic and bistatic RCS. Thus, the RCS of the antenna can be changed by injecting and extracting ethanol while sustaining the antenna’s radiation performance in terms of bandwidth, radiation patterns, and gain. The mechanism of the absorber is investigated. The simulated results show that the antenna with this absorber has monostatic and bistatic RCS reduction bands from 2.0 to 18.0 GHz and a maximum RCS reduction of 35 dB with an average RCS reduction of 13.28 dB. Without ethanol, the antenna realizes a gain of 12.1 dBi, which drops by 2 dB when the lossy ethanol is injected. The measured and simulated results agree well.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3138525","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071227); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20201289); Open Research Program in China's State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves(grant numbers:K202027); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:xcxjh20210402); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9670661","Ethanol;radar cross section (RCS);reconfigurable;slot antenna array","Ethanol;Antenna arrays;Liquids;Antennas;Slot antennas;Containers;Absorption","","21","","31","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Subsequently, the variational expectation maximization (EM) strategy is used to perform the Bayesian inference. Moreover, the damped generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) is further adopted to circumvent the matrix inversion in the variational EM procedure, thus making the overall process computationally very efficient.

After the DOA of each separated signal is estimated, the paired ranges are obtained from the 1-D maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. The proposed algorithm avoids high-dimensional spectral searches, subspace extraction, and any preprocessing such as spatial smoothing, leading to low computational complexities and high estimation accuracy.

In this communication, we are going to push forward the deep transfer learning to the hydraulic fracture imaging problem by proposing a two-step approach: 1) train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct target geometries by a relatively large amount of approximated field patterns generated from a simplified model and 2) fine-tune the top layers of transferred CNN by a small amount of true field patterns generated through a full model. The advantages include the rapid generation of large amount of data through the simplified model and the high reconstruction accuracy through a careful design of the deep transfer learning. The CNN trained through the deep transfer learning can accurately reconstruct the lateral extent and direction of fractures with unseen conductivity and white Gaussian noise, showing a notable acceleration/accuracy enhancement over the previous CNN trained by mixing a small number of true data into the approximated data as data augmentation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161325","U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory(grant numbers:DE-FE0031785); Advanced Energy Consortium with ExxonMobil, Repsol, Total, and Shell as members; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743614","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);deep transfer learning;hydraulic fracture imaging","Data models;Transfer learning;Computational modeling;Imaging;Convolutional neural networks;Hydraulic systems;Kernel","","5","","26","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
