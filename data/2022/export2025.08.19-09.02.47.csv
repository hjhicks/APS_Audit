"Low-Profile High-Directivity Dual-Beam Circularly Polarized Antennas Under Operation of Two Odd Modes","J. -F. Lin; L.

It is discussed that both radiation patterns and characteristic angles (CAs) of the two orthogonal odd modes are critical factors in the design of dual-beam circularly polarized (CP) antennas. However, neither of them could be correctly derived from a two-element-array model. By adjusting resonant frequencies (ResFs) in different ways, the two odd modes could achieve a 90° difference in CA. Moreover, the two odd modes have similar dual-beam radiation patterns with peak values in the same vertical plane. By further effectively exciting the two odd modes and fully suppressing the two even ones, four CP dual-beam patch antennas are successfully designed. Both simulated and measured results validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in the design of low-profile high-directivity dual-beam CP patch antennas. It is also discussed that the pointing angle of dual-beam could be reduced by enlarging patch distance or utilizing higher-order odd modes, while the axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth could be improved by increasing substrate height or introducing a broadband feeding network.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3090826","National Natural Science Foundation of China under General Program(grant numbers:61571468,61971475); Science and Technology Development Fund of Macao under FDCT Research Grant(grant numbers:0095/2019/A2); University of Macau under Multi-Year Research Grants(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00073-FST); Special Grant(grant numbers:CPG2021-00003-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465681","Characteristic modes analysis (CMA);circular polarization;dual-beam;even/odd modes;high-directivity;low profile","Antenna radiation patterns;Antennas;Perturbation methods;Slot antennas;Couplings;Patch antennas;Radar antennas","","12","","65","IEEE","25 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To realize CP radiation, a new design concept of using coupling stub is first illustrated. The coupling stub is equivalent as a combination of a dipole- ${c}$  and dipole- ${y}$ . The dipole- ${c}$  not only couples proper energy from the  ${x}$ -axis arranged driven dipole- ${x}$  to the orthogonally arranged dipole- ${y}$  but also provides quadrature phase delay to the dipole- ${y}$ . Therefore, CP radiation is realized for the presented configuration. To improve the input impedance caused by the strong coupling, a long narrow strip is incorporated for the enhancement of impedance bandwidth. Based on the design concept, a compact and wideband CP antenna by using the coupling stub and stepped square loop is developed to further increase the operation bandwidth and realize stable radiation. The designed antenna was finally fabricated for performance verification. Both the simulation and measurement show that the developed antenna can have a wide overlapped impedance and axial ratio (AR) bandwidth from 1.1 to 1.74 GHz with a compact radiator size.

Such tapers are used to match wideband gradient index (GRIN) lens antennas. To simplify, fabrication tapers are often constrained to physically uniform layers wherein commensurate line theory cannot predict the frequency response. Therefore, we present a new design algorithm that derives an effective permittivity  $\epsilon _{eff}$  to equalize the electrical length of commensurate and noncommensurate line tapers. The algorithm provides a systematic design method with predictable frequency response for noncommensurate line tapers. Nevertheless, there are several unavoidable nonidealities present in such discretized tapers which we discuss and provide recommendations for mitigation. The algorithm is used to design a Klopfenstein taper with return loss better than 15 dB from 8 to 78 GHz. The design is fabricated and measurements agree with simulation across the WR90, WR28, and WR12 bands. An approximate efficiency formula is proposed that predicts the aperture efficiency of taper-matched lenses without the need for time-consuming full-wave simulations. Various lenses are designed and compared to highlight the advantages of Klopfenstein tapers in GRIN lens design. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed design method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3096552","Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-20-C-1067); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490525","Gradient index (GRIN) lens;inhomogeneous media;matching taper;metamaterial;millimeter-wave","Lenses;Impedance;Permittivity;Passband;Antennas;Apertures;Prediction algorithms","","14","","26","CCBY","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna utilizes a double-layer (D-L) spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs) structure which exhibits stronger field confinement and lower cutoff frequency than the single-layer (S-L) SSPPs structure. The modulated D-L SSPPs structure can excite the space harmonic distributing in the fast-wave region and retains transmission in the slow-wave region. By combing the modulated D-L SSPPs waveguide and the Vivaldi radiator, both the slow-wave radiation (endfire mode) and the fast-wave radiation (frequency scanning mode) can be aroused in the two operating bands. An example antenna is designed and fabricated. In the slow-wave range from 3 to 9 GHz, the antenna works in the endfire mode with the beam direction of 90° and the realized gain varying from 3.55 to 8.24 dBi. Within the fast waveband from 13 to 34 GHz, the antenna operates in the frequency-scanning mode, accomplishing beam scanning from −90° to ±42.5° with the realized gain of 9.45–15.67 dBi.

The bottom layer is the beamforming network (BFN), which is composed of four cruciform couplers and two −45° phase shifters realized by groove GWGs. Four output ports of the BFN are connected to the slot arrays on the top layer through 180° E-plane bends. The output amplitudes of the BFN are −6.3 ± 0.5 dB and the phase errors are within ±14° from 26 to 32 GHz with a bandwidth of 20%. To relieve the grating lobe problem, groove GWGs are transited to ridge GWGs on the top layer and the slot array is fed from ridge GWGs. Due to the topology of the BFN, the slot array is oriented along the diagonal plane and as a result, the multibeam antenna is 45° linearly polarized. To handle the dip emerging in the side beam caused by the finite ground of the BFN, several metal fences working as a soft surface are applied to suppress the edge diffractions. Besides, the gain is increased by 0.78 dB compared to the case without metal fences at 29 GHz. Thanks to the low-loss property of GWG technology, high gain, and high radiation efficiency are obtained. The maximum gain is 17.46 dBi with the beam direction at −11° for Port 1 and 16.51 dBi with the beam direction at 37° for Port 2.

The proposed metasurface is formed by the two layers of printed metallic patch unit cells on either substrate surface to miniaturize the metasurface size and enhance design flexibility by regulating the extent of electromagnetic coupling between the two layers. Despite the low profile of the antenna, a wideband operation is accomplished by operating the metasurface in the nonresonant region that facilitates wideband phase compensation and its truncation to a finite dimension with an additional transverse electric (TE) surface wave resonance. The guidelines for the design of the surface is derived from a comparison of unit cell structures and an approach is introduced to correlate their potential with surface susceptibility parameters. A detailed parametric study addresses the critical concern on the overall dimensions of the finite metasurface. A ±45°-polarized dipole antenna with an overall thickness of  $0.15~\lambda _{0}$  ( $\lambda _{0}$  is the wavelength in free space at the center operating frequency) is designed as example. The measured results show a  $\vert \text{S}_{11}\vert \le -10$  dB impedance bandwidth of 46.4% over the frequency range of 1.69–2.71 GHz with average boresight gain of 9 dBi with a ground plane of  $1.1\lambda _{0} \times 1.1\lambda _{0}$ , well covering 2G (1.71–1.92 GHz), 3G (1.88–2.17 GHz), and LTE (2.3–2.4 GHz and 2.5–2.69 GHz) bands.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3098554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9496268","Metasurface;low profile;wideband antenna;susceptibility;surface waves","Metasurfaces;Broadband antennas;Surface waves;Antennas;Substrates;Dipole antennas;Surface impedance","","28","","48","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ESAs traditionally suffer from a stringent tradeoff between bandwidth and efficiency that is caused by a high reactive input impedance. Conventional resonant-matching networks can reduce this impedance to improve efficiency, but at the cost of having a narrow operational bandwidth and often a large physical structure. In this article, we propose a time-varying matching technique that removes the need for resonant matching entirely. Our concept is to rapidly vary the conductivity of the antenna in order to prevent reflections from returning to the antenna feed, effectively making the antenna nonreciprocal so that it appears infinitely long and is therefore matched to the characteristic impedance of the surrounding transmission line. An ESA with such a matching scheme would be able to radiate over a wider bandwidth since the matching occurs in the time domain. This technique would be particularly useful for generating very-low-frequency (VLF)/low-frequency (LF) waves, which are uniquely suited for many applications such as long-range and underwater communication. We present the theory of operation for such an antenna as well as results from numerical modeling, which suggests improved performance over that of a conventional ESA.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3096950","Office of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator Program of the Georgia Institute of Technology(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2526); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) through the Georgia Institute of Technology(grant numbers:HR0011-16-2-0031); Air Force STTR Program of Long Wave Inc. and Georgia Institute of Technology(grant numbers:FA8750-20-C-0205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490519","Efficiency–bandwidth tradeoff;electrically small antenna (ESA);matching network;nonreciprocal network;pulse amplitude modulation (PAM);time-varying antenna;very low frequency (VLF)/low frequency (LF)","Antennas;Bandwidth;Dipole antennas;Broadband antennas;Impedance;Resistance;Transmitting antennas","","12","","60","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the context of leaky-wave antennas (LWAs), it is important to have accurate design rules for optimizing the gain of the antenna for practical finite-length structures. In this work, taking advantage of the recent formulas derived for the accurate evaluation of the beamwidth in finite-size 1-D unidirectional LWAs, we obtain optimum conditions for this general class of antennas. In particular, design rules for minimizing the beamwidth or maximizing the gain are obtained. The latter is evaluated with a fully analytical procedure through the definition of a correction function that improves the accuracy of the common gain–beamwidth relation. The effects of material losses are also discussed to show how they can affect the optimization procedure. These results apply to any 1-D unidirectional LWA, because no assumptions are made on the wavenumber dispersion, which is instead structure-specific. However, the optimization of two practical examples, namely a holey and a slitted LWA, is discussed to show practical application of the proposed design rules.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3098560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9496128","1-D arrays;beamwidth;gain;leaky waves;leaky-wave antennas (LWAs);radiation patterns","Antennas;Optimization;Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Leaky wave antennas;Computational modeling;Two dimensional displays","","9","","44","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, the single microstrip patch antenna (MPA) is theoretically investigated by using characteristic mode analysis. It demonstrates that a large number of radiative modes, i.e., CM1 to CM7, are excited for the traditional MPA. By selecting its quarter patch configuration with shorting pins, only a few modes, i.e., CM2 and CM7, could be resonated for the quarter patch antenna (QPA). Meanwhile, their nonbroadside radiated fields could be transformed into the broadside radiation. Particularly, the polarizations of CM2 and CM7 are maintained orthogonally with each other. Next, a linear slot is etched on the patch to reduce the magnitude ratio between  $\vert E_{\mathrm {\theta }}\vert $  and  $\vert E_{\varphi }\vert $  components. After that, the resonant frequency of CM7 is moved closely to that of CM2 for nearby 90° phase difference. With these arrangements, the compact CP performance is acquired by combining its CM2 and CM7. Furthermore, a pair of QPAs with CP diversity is deeply studied. The results prove that the antenna has successfully acquired both of left-handed CP (LHCP) and right-handed CP (RHCP) performances at dual ports. Moreover, the low mutual coupling between them is generated under extremely small spacing. In final, the proposed antenna is fabricated and tested. Both of LHCP and RHCP patterns are formed of around 4.785 GHz. Besides, the proposed antenna occupies the small overall volume  $0.023\lambda _{\mathrm {g}}^{3}$  ( $\lambda _{\mathrm {g}}$  is the guided wavelength), that is only half of the traditional patch ( $0.045\lambda _{\mathrm {g}}^{3}$ ), and maintains the isolation as high as about 24 dB under extremely small distance (0.3 mm).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111344","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801348,61971475); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2019JM-201); University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00073-FST,FDCT0095/2019/A2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538988","Circularly polarized diversity;characteristic mode analysis (CMA);compact size;extremely small spacing;mutual coupling;patch antenna","Antennas;Patch antennas;Resonant frequency;Current;Diversity reception;Antenna radiation patterns;Characteristic mode analysis","","32","","27","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

General expressions are provided that relate the coupling between radiated beams to the associated current distributions on the radiating aperture. When expanding the currents in terms of basis functions, the beam coupling can be also written in terms of coupling contributions due to each pair of basis functions. The analysis is applied to antenna arrays with different levels of mutual coupling between the array elements. More specifically, arrays of resonant elements, characterized by very low mutual coupling, are compared with arrays of connected elements, which are strongly coupled.

A waveguide-based feeding network with serpentine-shaped transitions is implemented to feed the eight-element cross-slotted array topology. The design of the feeding network ensures an equal power split and in-phase distribution between the eight elements with a phase deviation that does not exceed 20°. The overall cross-slotted waveguide array is prototyped as a proof of concept. The measured results show a maximum gain of 24.5 dBi for both polarization schemes. The measured half power beamwidth (HPBW) is 8° in the elevation plane and 12° in the azimuthal plane. The measured cross-polarization between the two circularly polarized schemes at both ports reaches a level of more than 26 dB. The comparison between the simulation and measurement results proves the validity of the proposed approach in achieving a high-gain dual circularly polarized structure for millimeter-wave communication.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3090863","Air Force Research Lab Cooperative Agreement(grant numbers:FA9453-16-2-0073); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465669","Cross-slots;dual circularly polarized;waveguide network","Planar waveguides;Gain;Topology;Phased arrays;Rectangular waveguides;Polarization;Waveguide transitions","","14","","22","IEEE","25 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed structure is based on a typical tapered balun loaded with several extra varactors. The proposed balun operates similar to a loaded line (LL) phase shifter, in which the varactors are added between the microstrip line and ground plane. It can provide balanced feed for broadband antennas and, at the same time, change the phase of the balanced feed in a cost-efficient way. It is found that range of the tunable phase shift relies on the number and variable capacitance of the varactors. To simplify the design procedure and explore the optimum performance, characteristics of a uniform microstrip line loaded with lumped capacitors are studied. It is found that gap between the capacitors and length of the microstrip line has relatively large effects on the impedance matching characteristics. According to this observation, the proposed balun is designed by applying the LL structure to a tapered balun. Within the frequency range of 0.8–2 GHz, the proposed balun loaded with two varactors achieves a tunable phase shift ranging from 17° to 61°. If the number of varactors increases to four, the range of tunable phase shift is from 41° to 161°.

The proposed ME dipole element backed by a cavity can reduce the mutual coupling and enhance the scanning performance of the antenna array. To achieve continuous beam-scanning ability, reflection-type phase shifters are designed with varactor diodes and integrated with the feeding network. The polarization agility is determined by embedding two switchable cross strips into the ME dipole element. By manipulating the states of the two switchable cross strips through dc bias controls, three different polarization states including linear polarization (LP), left-hand CP (LHCP), and right-hand CP (RHCP) can be realized. For verification, a prototype of the antenna array was fabricated and measured. A good agreement between the simulation and the measurement is obtained, thus validating the multiple reconfigurable capability of the antenna array in polarization and radiation pattern.

The NSA is introduced into a sparse phased array and the grating lobe is suppressed by keeping the radiation pattern null of NSA pointing at the angle of the grating lobe during beam scanning. Meanwhile, the beam direction of NSA is steered to a wider angle with the variation of null angle. The main lobes during beam scanning are located within the 3 dB beamwidth of NSA.

The solution is based on the near-field meta-steering (NFMS) method, which is implemented through a pair of highly transmitting hybrid metasurfaces (HMs) that are placed above a high-gain CP RLSA antenna in the near-field region. Cells in HMs, unlike conventional metasurfaces (CMs), can provide exact or close to exact phase shift with transmission magnitude larger than −1 dB. This is achieved by combining the nonoverlapping phase ranges of two dramatically different phase-shifting cells. The RLSA is stationary, while the two HMs are rotated to steer the beam in a 2-D (azimuth and elevation) space. The measured results of the prototype demonstrate that the system can steer its beam to a maximum elevation angle of 40.6° with a maximum gain of 30.9 dBic. The axial ratio remained less than 3 dB in the 3 dB beamwidth even when the beam is steered. The height of the system is only 4.5 cm, which is much less than mechanically steered reflector antennas.

By optimizing the size parameters of the unit cell, the optimal SA shows more than 90% absorption in the frequency range from 3.4 to 18 GHz by employing a lightweight porous carbon derived from sustainable biomass. The lightweight porous biochar provides the SA low-density properties with a surface density of only 0.574  $\text{g}\cdot $ cm $^{-2}$ . In such a SA, the greatly enhanced absorption performance mainly originates from the synergistic effect of microscopic and macroscopic scales. By optimizing the pattern design of the SA, the effective impedance is matched with free space in a wide frequency range, thus dissipating more electromagnetic waves through multiple resonances and edge scattering effects.

With properly designed unit cell structures, the ESS is almost transparent to an incident wave of low power, while it fully rejects the high-power incidence. Meanwhile, the ESS unit cells are endowed with different reflection phases. Therefore, when arranged in a chessboard configuration, the high-power waves rejected by the ESS are diffused into other directions resulting in a low backscattering. To demonstrate the design concept, a diffusive ESS with an operating frequency of 3 GHz is designed. A unit cell with an asymmetric structure is proposed, which provides identical transmission coefficients but opposite reflection phases on its two sides. By properly assembling the unit cell and its mirror, an ESS with low-power transmission and high-power diffusive backscattering is designed. Equivalent circuit models are constructed to analyze the unit cell and to formulate the design guidelines. Moreover, the diffusive ESS is fabricated and measured based on the free-space setup, where a good agreement is observed between the simulation and measurement. The transmission magnitude is larger than −0.5 dB and smaller than −25 dB under the low- and high-power normal incidences at the operating frequency. In addition, the backscattering of the ESS is reduced significantly in comparison with a metallic plate of the same size.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3098603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9496107","Backscattering;diffusion;energy-selective surface (ESS);frequency-selective surface (FSS)","Backscatter;Integrated circuit modeling;Surface waves;Equivalent circuits;Encoding;Mirrors;Metasurfaces","","32","","37","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through combined experimental and simulated analysis of multiple carbon fiber antennas, the effective conductivity for a biaxial weave carbon fiber composite was determined to be between 7000 and 13 000 S/m in the VHF spectrum. Carbon fiber antenna performance is found to be particularly sensitive to the contact between the carbon fibers and the copper feed; however, radiation efficiencies (REs) of carbon fiber composite antennas are found to be within 2%–10% of a geometrically identical copper antenna, and their bandwidths are nearly identical.

Due to the very large number of possible pixel connection combinations, this optimization needs to be performed by heuristic algorithms. In this work, the sensitivity analysis is proposed for the efficient optimization of pixel antennas. In the approach, each individual pixel of the antenna is perturbed in turn to obtain the sensitivity vector of the objective function. The sensitivity analysis at each step is performed efficiently through the use of algebraic simplification that avoids matrix inversion and leads to a significant saving in computational load. The optimization process then selects the perturbation with the greatest sensitivity. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed optimization method. For both examples, the proposed approach performs the optimization with significantly fewer iterations and either achieves a better or similar minimum in the objective function compared to genetic algorithm approaches.

The use of nonconformal meshes provides improved flexibility for computer-aided-design (CAD) prototyping and tessellation. The proposed formulation can readily address nonconformal multimaterial junctions, where three or more material regions meet. The continuity of the electric surface current across the junction contours is enforced by the combination of the boundary conditions implicit in the JMCFIE formulation and the weakly imposed interior penalty (IP) between the contacting surfaces within each region. This completely avoids the cumbersome junction problem, which no longer requires any special treatment.

In this article, the curl–curl eigenvalue problem in a resonator coupled with a waveguide boundary in a way that allows outgoing waves along longitudinally homogeneous waveguide structures is considered. This problem has a square root dependence on the frequency, and thus, adapted integration contours are required to reliably find eigenvalues in the vicinity of branch cuts. The filter function-based analysis of the quadrature rules has been used and improved to reduce the problem to consider the behavior of filter functions on eigenvalues and singular points only. First, conformally mapped circular contours are considered for problems with one branch cut. For problems where there are several branch cuts necessary, the Gauß–Legendre quadrature rules on closed polygonal contours had been analyzed. In both cases, exponential convergence rates were obtained.

Previous measurement campaigns exist for outdoor areas and higher frequencies; however, extensive indoor measurements at these frequencies are missing from the literature. Both WLAN and LTE networks use 2.4- and 5-GHz bands. For this work, indoor measurements were carried out in two distinct indoor environments, at two frequencies, and various models were compared. The measurements were made at the Deutsches Museum Bonn and the ICT cubes, an office space at RWTH Aachen University. Both empirical and deterministic models are tested on the data; the free-space path loss model, the single and dual-slope models with line-of-sight and nonline-of-sight, ray tracing models, and artificial neural network models were all tested and evaluated.

The MPA structure consists of an array of  ${m\times n}$  magnets stacked in  $n$  rows (m magnets of the same magnetization per row) and a solenoid that encompasses the array. The magnetic flux generated by the solenoid couples to the magnets through a mechanical motion and creates a strong time variant magnetic field at the resonance frequency of the array. The proposed MPA is developed utilizing bearings with extremely small damping which hold the magnets, enable efficient oscillation, and guarantees a high-quality factor ( $Q$ -factor). A comprehensive analysis to study the performance of the MPA and a conventional solenoid will be provided and accordingly, characteristics of an arbitrary  ${m\times n}$  array in terms of field strength, resonance frequency, transmission efficiency and inductance are studied. Furthermore, a figure of merit (FOM) is introduced as the ratio of efficiency to the maximum linear dimension of the antenna. The experimental results for a fabricated  $5 \times 11$  array show a resonance frequency of 715 Hz and a Q-factor of 94 while the maximum linear dimension of the antenna is just 9 cm. Moreover, measurement results show 24.9 dB improvement in the transmission efficiency of the MPA compared to the efficiency of a single solenoid of the same dimensions. The MPA has the FOM of  ${1.26\times 1}{0}^{{4}}$  which is noticeably higher than that of proposed antennas in the literature.

While such studies are useful, they do not capture the form-factor constraints of user equipments (UEs), such as moderate array sizes, gains, and beamwidths. In this work, we study the impact of hand/body blockage with a UE at 28 GHz built on commercial millimeter-wave components. We report five controlled studies with different types of hand holdings/grips, antenna types, and directional/narrow beams. For both hard and loose hand grips, we report considerably lower blockage loss estimates than prior works. Critical in estimating the loss is the definition of a “region of interest” (RoI) around the UE where the impact of the hand/body is seen. Toward this goal, we define an RoI that includes the spatial area where significant energy is seen in either the no blockage or blockage modes.

Previous work reveals that the channel transfer function (CTF) of a standard NHP home cage in the 915 MHz and 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands resembles a resonant cavity exhibiting deep nulls throughout the cage volume, which are particularly acute for round-trip backscatter paths. In this work, we investigate a novel application of passive antenna mode stirring via switched parasitic antennas (SPAs) to reduce the magnitude and prevalence of deep nulls in the cage CTF. We present a system leveraging four cage-ceiling-mounted SPAs with two dynamically controlled impedance states each, yielding 16 total mode stirring configurations. We compare the frequency-domain power ratio measurements at 126 positions throughout the cage taken with and without passive antenna mode stirring. In the 915 MHz ISM band, the optimized SPA configuration improved the maximum two-way insertion loss in 68% of testing locations, reducing the worst case two-way insertion loss by 60.2 dB. In the 2.4 GHz ISM band, the maximum two-way insertion loss was improved in 53% of testing locations, reducing the worst case two-way insertion loss by 35.6 dB.

The mode-group (MG) superposed by specific single-mode plane spiral OAM (PSOAM) waves has been proved to be a flexible beamforming method to achieve the azimuthal pattern diversity, which inherits the spiral phase distribution of conventional OAM wave. Thus, it possesses both beam directionality and vorticity. In this article, it is the first time to show and verify a novel PSOAM MG based multiple-in–multiple-out (MG-MIMO) communication link experimentally in a line-of-sight (LoS) scenario. A compact multimode PSOAM antenna is demonstrated experimentally to generate multiple-independent controllable PSOAM waves, which can be used for constructing MGs. After several proof-of-principle tests, it has been verified that the beam directionality gain of MG can improve the receiving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level in an actual system. Meanwhile, the vorticity can provide another degree of freedom (DoF) to reduce the spatial correlation of MIMO system. Furthermore, a tentative long-distance transmission experiment operated at 10.2 GHz has been performed successfully at a distance of 50 m with a single-way spectrum efficiency of 3.7 bits/s/Hz/stream.

This allows for addressing a legitimate user in real-time who can retrieve the signal via synchronous demodulation with the pseudorandom key of the metasurface while camouflaging the signal from the adversary by lowering the probability of detection.

The DSPR is placed above the arrays with orthogonal and parallel dipole elements. After applying the DSPR, the mutual coupling at the center frequency of 3.5 GHz is reduced to −40 dB for both arrays, and the overall mutual coupling is better than −26 dB within the band of 3.3–3.7 GHz, and the reflection coefficients remain below −12 dB. The antennas maintain stable radiation patterns within the operation bandwidth with a 0.5 dB increase of the realized gain. Since the DSPR can effectively reduce both co- and cross-polarization coupling, the mutual coupling between circularly polarized antennas in a  $1 \times 4$  array is reduced to below −35 dB thanks to the DSPR.

Based on this mechanism, a three-layer patch antenna with two radiation nulls is designed. Two radiation nulls are introduced on both sides of the passband, consequently, a quasi-elliptic bandpass response can be obtained. Moreover, the proposed antenna features high efficiency since no extra filtering circuit is utilized. A prototype antenna operating at 1 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured for validity verification. The measured results agree well with the simulated one, showing that the prototype antenna has a fractional impedance bandwidth of 16% (0.91–1.07 GHz), a flat passband gain response with peak value of 8.83 dBi, a high efficiency about −0.41 dB in the passband.

To obtain a DP implementation of ENZ antenna, an antiphase ENZ (AP-ENZ) mode is used based on a slot-fed substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) antenna at its cutoff frequency, in which the electric field presents a sign-function-like distribution, presenting a fixed operating frequency independent on length. The proposed DP length-irrelevant antenna design is composed of a cross-shaped SIW operating on two orthogonal AP-ENZ modes, which are excited by a cavity-backed cross-shaped slot with good port isolation. The SIW lengths for both polarizations can be tuned independently without disturbing the operation frequency with controllable radiation patterns. To be specific, we study two cases of different lengths where sidelobe elimination and high gain radiation are realized, respectively. To verify this design, two antenna prototypes Ant. 1 and Ant. 2 are fabricated and tested, exhibiting agreements between simulation and experiment. The proposed Ant. 1 presents no sidelobes at 2.42 GHz while Ant. 2 shows a high gain of 10.56 dBi from 2.45 to 2.55 GHz. The proposed design method enables antennas with a variety of radiation patterns to be designed at a fixed frequency and both symmetric and asymmetric patterns for DP antennas.

Initially, the radiated fields of the traditional slot antenna are theoretically studied using characteristic modes (CMs). The results demonstrate that its CM1, CM2, and CM3 are resonated around 2.39, 4.78, and 7.17 GHz, respectively. Both CM1 and CM3 maintain the bidirectional radiation patterns, whereas CM2 generates a radiation null in the broadside direction. Then, in order to utilize the nearby CM1 and CM2 for wide bandwidth, the linear slot is properly folded so as to transform the nonbidirectional pattern of CM2 into the bidirectional one. After that, the narrow slot is reformed as the stepped scheme, thus reallocating these dual modes in proximity to each other. With these arrangements, the impedance bandwidth of the antenna is dramatically widened with two attenuation poles, while keeping a compact size and stable radiation pattern. Finally, the proposed antenna is fabricated and tested. Measured results show that the antenna without any extra feeding network has gained a wide bandwidth ( $\vert S_{11}\vert < -10$  dB) of around 31.4% ranging from 3.22 to 4.42 GHz, which is about 2.24 times wider than its traditional counterpart (14%). Besides, the overall size of the slot radiator is kept as small as about  $0.42\lambda _{0} \times 0.06\lambda _{0}$  ( $\lambda _{0}$  is the free-space wavelength).

Most of the existing planar Bessel beam generators are implemented in a central feeding radial topology and hard to generate the Bessel beam with the transverse linear polarization. In this communication, a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) slot array antenna is proposed to generate the transverse linearly polarized Bessel beam. The desired phase and amplitude distribution of the Bessel beam can be easily realized by such an array. With the inherent 0°/180° output phase of the comb-like divider considered, the desired 0°/180° phase distribution is implemented by placing adjacent slots on the opposite (0°) or the same side (180°) within a linear array and by employing adjacent linear arrays with the inverse (180°) or the same (0°) slot offset direction accordingly. The offset of the slot, as well as the tuning metalized vias within the comb-like divider, is modulated to generate the desired amplitude distribution. After reducing the influence of the rectangularly truncated aperture by adding a Gauss-tapered amplitude distribution, a transverse linearly polarized Bessel beam SIW slot array antenna is designed with more than 100 mm depth-of-field (DoF) and less than −25 dB cross polarization.

In fact, although the aperture excitations optimization problem, given two specific continuous or DAs, has been already researched, the effect of antenna arrays design choices (such as the number of antenna elements or their spacings) on the WPT efficiency has not been investigated yet. In order to do that, WPT efficiency formulation has been theoretically analyzed to understand the different antenna parameters contributions to the power transfer efficiency (PTE). After that, the problem of the array excitation optimization in the sense of maximum PTE has been revisited including cases with or without perfect impedance matching. Finally, different array designs and relative achievable PTEs have been compared systematically, and it is shown that arrays with interelement spacing in the order of  $0.3\lambda $ – $0.4\lambda $  (tightly coupled arrays) provide the largest PTE (also for oblique WPT cases) when the array excitation is calculated taking into account the impedance mismatching.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3098581","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1802102); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971113,61901095); Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Planning Program(grant numbers:2020YFG0039,2021YFG0013,2021YFH0133); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9540783","Antenna arrays;antenna radiation patterns;mutual coupling","Antenna arrays;Aperture antennas;Microwave antenna arrays;Optimization;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna theory;Transmitting antennas","","6","","30","IEEE","17 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The difference between array diversity and super-resolution imaging is discussed first. The phase differences caused by the “effective space” between adjacent antenna elements are the critical factors of diversity enhancement. The scatterer array, which is made of cross-structure periodically, is placed on top of the antenna array to adjust the phase center of the radiation pattern of each antenna port. By increasing the “equivalent size” of the antenna array, the correlation of part of the adjacent ports in the antenna array is decreased; thus, the array diversity is improved. Through a set of comparative examples, the effectiveness of the scatterer array is clearly demonstrated.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3098568","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFA0709800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9496170","Capacity;diversity;multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna;scatterer array","Antenna arrays;MIMO communication;Correlation;Imaging;Phased arrays;Mutual coupling;Microstrip antenna arrays","","36","","25","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
