First, we demonstrate that the DDL doublet’s in- plane synchronous counter-rotation and co- rotation could scan its focus radially and azimuthally, respectively.

Periodic radiating semicircular patches are incorporated into the vicinity of the TL that form an additional momentum caused to convert the slow-wave SP mode to radiating leaky-mode and placement of extra metallic ground makes the radiated beam unidirectional.

We first propose a broadband impedance matching between the input port and the slot aperture based on two-section wideband distributed network (TWBDN). We also propose a TWBDN matched stacked patch (TMSP) network based on constant VSWR circles to attain broadband matching between the slot aperture and patches in an ACSP. To facilitate the measurements, a novel low-loss transition from a ground-signal-ground (GSG) port to a feedline is proposed. The proposed structure suppresses surface waves induced in the WR-08 band by placing via arrays around the feedline, which largely reduces unwanted resonance modes, thereby leading to uniformly high radiation efficiency across the band.

The lack of dielectrics not only substantially reduces the cost and weight but also increases its potential in space and high-power applications. More importantly, the new MMs are designed such that they can be made by cutting narrow slots in fully planar thin metal sheets, retaining structural rigidity while reducing the complexity, cost, and weight. The same MM works for any polarization. Each cell in the new MMs has close to ideal phase shift and transmission magnitude greater than −0.9 dB.

A hybrid decoupling method is used to mitigate the mixed types of mutual couplings among the multiple IFAs: introducing multiple decoupling capacitors for the couplings of two back-to-back IFA pairs and T-shaped mode transformers for the remaining couplings. The decoupling capacitors not only decouple the back-to-back IFA pairs but also broaden the impedance bandwidth of each IFA. The T-shaped mode transformer transforms the concerned antenna from an IFA mode into a balanced loop mode, preventing the induced current on the victim IFAs of the face-to-face and back-to-face pairs. One four-element example and one eight-element example are designed and measured to justify the proposed decoupling concept. The measured results of the four-element IFAs show that after decoupling, all the six mutual couplings among the four IFAs are reduced by about 10 dB from 3.3 to 3.8 GHz, with average total efficiencies throughout the band improving from 57% to 72% for IFA 1 and from 47% to 55% for IFA 2.

The presented design exploits substantial changes in the overlapped Moiré patterns to minimize the needed actuation for antenna reconfiguration. The novel antenna design is based on stacking two circular FR4 substrates on top of a truncated edge rectangular patch antenna. The top layers of both the substrates are milled into horizontal stripes forming the Moiré patterns. One of these substrates is fixed with respect to the antenna, while the second one rotates with respect to the fixed substrate. Upon rotation, these stripes from the two substrates overlap in pattern, which shapes the antenna. As a result, the antenna design is capable of switching its polarization scheme between vertical, horizontal, and circular with left-hand orientation. In addition, the Moiré patterns can also enhance the directivity and gain of the proposed antenna. The reconfiguration’s mechanical actuation is achieved via a nontraditional ratchet mechanism that uses shape memory alloys (SMAs). This realized actuation system is fast, flexible in its positioning, has low energy expenditure, and minimizes interference with antenna operation. An antenna prototype is fabricated and tested where measured results match the simulated performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3187509","American University of Beirut (AUB), University Research Board (URB); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9818861","Mechanical actuation;Moiré patterns;polarization reconfiguration;ratchet mechanism;reconfigurable antennas;shape memory alloys (SMAs)","Antennas;Actuators;Shape;Springs;Substrates;Wires;Shape memory alloys","","4","","40","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two parts are coupled through the slot on the ground. The cavities are completely enclosed by the metal holes and copper cover to eliminate radiation loss. The loaded slots can tune the frequencies of the first two modes in the FSD-QMSIW cavity for dual-band operation.

The HCLA is wearable with a compact size of 2.62 cm3 and operates across the 1–5 GHz bandwidth. The quasi-bowtie antenna is loaded with a high-contrast (i.e., alternating layers of high- and low-permittivity materials) and low-loss dielectric to improve directivity and gain into the biological tissues. Measurement results at 2.4 GHz are in good agreement with simulations and show 5.72 dB improvement in transmission loss over the most efficient into-body radiator reported in the past. At the high end of the frequency bandwidth, the simulation results for two antennas placed across each other with tissue in between show ~12.5 dB improvement in transmission loss.

A coaxial-fed probe structure effectively excites traveling waves that propagate along a closed path in the toroidal waveguide. Inverted L- and planar helical-shaped radiators, whose pickup structures extract power from the waveguide through its top wall, are introduced to radiate, respectively, linearly-polarized (LP) and circularly-polarized (CP) directed beams. The dispersion properties of the closed waveguide’s traveling wave are determined and the associated propagation phase along circular paths with specific radii guides the placement of these radiators to achieve a directive beam at a specified angle.

For this purpose, two critical issues are significantly investigated and explored. The first effort is attempted to construct two pairs of orthogonal polarization with opposite rotation, i.e., ( ${\it \lambda }$ - and  $0.5{\it \lambda }$ -modes) and ( $0.5{\it \lambda }$ - and  $2{\it \lambda }$ -modes), by properly reshaping the equivalent magnetic currents of the slot radiator. Another attempt is to reallocate these modes in proximity to each other in virtue of stub-loaded technique and ensure them to resonate in the designated sequence of  ${\it \lambda }$ -,  $0.5{\it {\lambda }}$ -, and  $2{\it \lambda }$ -modes instead of the inherent sequence. With these improvements, the dual-CP performance can be successfully realized for our designed antenna. Finally, for experimental verification, a dual-band dual-CP slot antenna in virtue of the proposed design approach is implemented and tested. It proves that the left- and right-hand CP radiation patterns toward the  ${z}$ -axis are satisfactorily obtained around 1.88 and 2.39 GHz by simultaneously employing the triple resonance, thus revealing a small FR of 1.27. Moreover, the dual operation bands hold stable in-band gains of about 2.8 and 3.5 dBic.

The antenna is constructed based on a configuration of coupled-mode patch antenna (CMPA), which consists of two coupling cavities with a shorting wall, and can generate vertically polarized modes. The CP is realized through a pair of orthogonally polarized modes of horizontal and vertical polarizations. Meanwhile, rendering them acquires an equal amplitude and a 90° phase difference. The horizontally polarized radiation mode is realized through inserting a crossed ground slot. Offset probe feed is used to excite all the radiation modes and introduce an additional phase shift for the CP. A set of offset ground slots (OGSs) are then applied to perturb the electromagnetic coupling of the modes and adjust the phase and magnitude of the radiating electric fields (E-fields). Several effects are synthesized, which results in a wide-beam circularly polarized (CP) endfire radiation. Aiming to improve the radiation performances, a cavity-backed planar reflector was applied in the experiment. Simulated and measured results are detailed and analyzed, which demonstrate that the measured 3 dB axial ratio (AR < 3 dB) bandwidth (ARBW) ranges from 3.385 to 3.428 GHz (1.2%), and the peak gain can be up to 3.4 dBi if the planar reflector is added.

To allow a completely free receiver movement, both the misalignment problems are concurrently addressed by forming widespread distributions of switched polarized H-field in the receiver region. To achieve this, current circulations through the four quadrant coils composing the proposed antenna are judiciously controlled to form three orthogonal H-field components. For lateral misalignment mitigation, the widespread field distributions are obtained by using a field-forming approach for optimizing the antenna parameters. To produce the switched polarized H-field for angular misalignment mitigation, time-switching of the orthogonal H-field components is performed. This switching operation is realized by three double pole double throw (DPDT) switches interconnecting the coils and integrated within the design for a cost-effective planar antenna solution. The fabricated prototype is measured and the experimental results are corroborated with the analysis.

This work is an attempt to extend the theory of characteristic modes (TCMs) to the lossy smartphone antenna for gaining insight into what causes efficiency variation and realizing efficiency improvement. Compared with the classical TCM, the CM analysis (CMA) adopted in this work has the capacity to handle lossy smartphone antenna. By using such an analysis approach, we find, quite interestingly, that suppressing the higher-order modes is an effective optimization strategy to enhance efficiency. Then, an optimized antenna with considerable improvement in efficiency is proposed. Finally, to meet the requirement of practical application, the additional LC circuit and through holes are introduced into this proposed optimized antenna. GSM 900 of 890–960MHz can be covered by this finally proposed antenna, and the measured peak total efficiency is improved from 26% to 43%.

This article investigates the Lorentz force and dissipated power of a VLF space-borne linear antenna in an anisotropic magnetoplasma as well as the deorbiting time of the system. By considering the inhomogeneity of the current and the effect of ordinary and extraordinary waves, we systematically quantified and analyzed the Lorentz force on the antenna in an anisotropic scenario. The dissipated power and system deorbiting time are then determined by integrating antenna theory and electrodynamics. The results show that the Lorentz force and the power will increase with the antenna length and radius, whereas the deorbiting time will decrease accordingly. It is also found that as the geomagnetic inclination angle increases, the Lorentz force and the power will slightly decrease. The proposed method can estimate the Lorentz force, power, and deorbiting time for arbitrary antennas, low Earth orbital conditions, and VLF ionospheric parameters.

Based on the original method, the wideband pattern can be regarded as a spatiotemporal spectral distribution, and the relationship between the spatiotemporal spectral distribution and finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter coefficients can be built as an STFT, which can be efficiently calculated by using 2-D fast Fourier transform (2-D-FFT). To achieve desired FI-shaped pattern performance, the spatiotemporal spectral distribution is iteratively adjusted by two new techniques called wideband pattern shaping and linear phase response (LPR)-based modification. Different from the constant phase response (CPR) processing in the original iterative STFT method, the LPR-based modification uses more relaxed phase requirements, thus releasing much more degrees of freedom. Numerical results show that the proposed method is effective even for very complicated pattern requirements, and it is very efficient in terms of both computation and storage.

Several numerical simulations comparing the proposed approach to some of the algorithms available in the open literature demonstrate the excellent performance of the approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3187513","Ministero dell’Istruzione dell’Università e della Ricerca (MIUR) Program “Dipartimenti di Eccellenza 2018–2022.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9818846","Antenna arrays;antenna radiation pattern synthesis;optimization methods;sparse array antennas","Layout;Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Convex functions;Iterative algorithms;Upper bound;Prototypes","","20","","54","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The endfire dipole antenna is designed as the radiating element of both bands. To eliminate the shading effect of the horizontal-polarized Ku-band antenna caused by the common ground, the director is loaded on the Ka-band antenna to increase the height of the equivalent phase center of the Ka-band antenna. The high-order mode of the horizontal-polarized Ku-band antenna is excited when the Ka-band antenna scans to a wide angle in H-plane within the frequency range of 33–34 GHz. An etched square ring is loaded on the Ku-band radiating arm to induce the reverse current to prevent such a high-order mode. The scanning blind spots occur at 33 and 35.8 GHz when the Ka-band antenna scans to 50° in E-plane owing to the mutual coupling between the Ka-band antenna and the vertical-polarized Ku-band antenna. A metallic strip is loaded on the vertical-polarized Ku-band antenna to eliminate the blind spot at 33 GHz. The feeding position of the vertical-polarized Ku-band antenna is elevated to eliminate the blind spot at 35.8 GHz. The periodic cell and finite array are simulated to verify the design proposed in this article. The results demonstrate that the design is effective and the beam-scanning coverage reaches  $\pm \mathrm{50}^{\circ }$  at both bands.

To meet this challenge, this work proposes a TMA with chaotic-enabled phase modulation (CPM) for secure transmission. The proposed CPM technique offers the chaos features of high randomness, unpredictability, and initial condition sensitive characteristic, to increase the information uncertainty for eavesdropping receivers. An optimization-based time sequence design approach is introduced to design optimal CPM time sequences for secure transmission in a given direction. Thus, a variety of security strategies including beam scanning, directional modulation (DM), and chaotic encryption are simultaneously enabled by the optimized CPM time sequence. Moreover, the CPM is a radio frequency (RF)-domain security technique without requiring any baseband modulation modules, which exhibits a simplified hardware architecture. Numerical analysis and experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed CPM technique. The results indicate that the security is improved by lowering the bit error rate (BER) between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter, and reducing the mutual information between eavesdropping receivers and the transmitter.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3191162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9834253","Beam scanning;secure transmission;time-modulated array (TMA)","Security;Receivers;Phase modulation;Phased arrays;Eavesdropping;Harmonic analysis;Amplitude modulation","","12","","40","IEEE","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The scan gain of the DDA can be manipulated by properly choosing the defined scan amplification factor  $K(\theta)$  of the DDL.

Rotation of antennas on curved surface is mathematically described by rotating its vectorial active element pattern (VAEP) in its local coordinate system (LCS). Then the scalar patterns and polarization unit vectors of all the rotated VAEPs are properly transformed and then interpolated at a unified angle sampling grid in a common coordinate system, where they are summed to obtain an approximated array expression. With this expression, element rotations and phases can be optimized using the constriction factor particle swarm optimization (CF-PSO) to synthesize desired shaped-beam pattern with controlled sidelobe level (SLL) and cross-polarization level (XPL). However, since rotations on curved surface introduce considerable variations to the element curvature and mutual coupling (MC), the synthesized array pattern would have considerable errors. A refined strategy is adopted then to improve the synthesis accuracy. The proposed method uses uniform amplitude weighting, thus saving many unequal power dividers. Three typical shaped pattern synthesis examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. A cylindrical array prototype with 24 rotated U-slot loaded patch antennas is fabricated and measured for practical validation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209268","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61871338,61721001); University of Technology Sydney; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906845","Conformal array;constriction factor particle swarm optimization (CF-PSO);cross-polarization level (XPL);rotation and phase optimization;shaped power pattern","Antenna arrays;Optimization;Antennas;Phased arrays;Matlab;Mutual couplings;Arrays","","20","","36","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Contrary to what has been previously done to get further insights from the electromagnetic behavior, a reliable reduced-order model completely describing a microwave circuit in a frequency band of interest is carried out. Following a theoretical analysis starting from time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations, we identify the dominant contributions to electromagnetics in a band of analysis. Making use of the reliable reduced-order model, we present the electromagnetic information in that reduced-order model in a more insightful manner, using a specific dynamical system representation of electromagnetics. As a result, a full-wave coupling matrix completely describing electromagnetics in the band of analysis is identified, where no narrowband approximation is considered, such as it is the case in classical coupling matrix circuit theory. No approximation is taken into account other than carrying out the analysis in a given frequency band, which can be arbitrarily large. The proposed approach provides a way to understand electromagnetics, where a full-wave coupling matrix allows the description of electromagnetics in a band of interest as a simple physically insightful circuit, and not the other way around. Finally, several real-life microwave circuits, such as a dual-mode filter and diplexer, will illustrate the capabilities and efficiency of the proposed approach.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3206536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9896729","Computer-aided engineering;design automation;finite-element methods (FEMs);Galerkin method;microwave circuits;reduced-basis methods (RBMs);reduced-order systems","Electromagnetics;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave circuits;Couplings;Mathematical models;Behavioral sciences;Integrated circuit modeling","","10","","51","IEEE","20 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, computing the effective refractive index of glide-symmetric waveguides with existing full-wave analysis techniques results in cumbersome parametric studies for each new design. This article presents a new analytic homogenization technique for glide-symmetric holey parallel-plate waveguides (PPWs). The dispersion equation of these structures, found by way of mode-matching, is simplified at low frequency using the properties of the modes resonating within the holes, independently of the hole shape. This simplified equation yields a closed-form expression of the effective refractive index, relying on the eigenmodes of the hole cross section. This formula avoids solving a 3-D full-wave problem and is fully analytic in the case of canonical hole shapes. Although derived in the quasi-static regime, it characterizes propagation over an ultrawide band, due to the low dispersive properties of glide symmetric structures. It is a function of the angle of propagation within the waveguide and can thus be used to study anisotropic properties. Its efficiency is demonstrated with the example of glide-symmetric PPWs with rectangular and circular holes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3187527","French Government under the ANR grant HOLeYMETA ANR JCJC 2016(grant numbers:ANR-16-CE24-0030); COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) through COST Action Symat(grant numbers:CA18223); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9818959","Analytic methods;glide symmetry (GS);homogenization;metasurfaces;mode-matching;periodic problems","Metasurfaces;Optical waveguides;Dispersion;Refractive index;Transmission line matrix methods;Harmonic analysis;Lenses","","10","","52","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, to reduce this high computational cost, nonuniform MSs can be modeled as zero-thickness boundaries, with sheets of electric and magnetic polarizations related to the fields by surface susceptibilities and the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs). While these two-sided boundary conditions (BCs) have been extensively studied for single sheets of resonant particles, it has not been shown if they can correctly model structures where the two sides are electrically isolated, such as a fully reflective surface. In particular, we consider in this work whether the fields scattered from a fully reflective MS can be correctly predicted for arbitrary field illuminations, with the source placed on either side of the surface. In the process, we also show the mapping of a perfect electric conductor (PEC) sheet with a dielectric cover layer to bianisoptropic susceptibilities.

The array factor of the metasurface with  $N \times N$  unit cells shows that controlling the number of prephases with varying values over the reflective surface can equivalently control the amplitude. Different from optimizing the prephase distribution, selection of the 0 and  $\pi /2$  prephases in specific  $N$  regions is used to suppress the SLLs. Therefore, the number of parameters in the optimization can be dramatically reduced from  $N^{2}$  to  ${N}$ . The prephase distribution is then designed based on the optimized number of prephases and a symmetric matrix for SLL suppression in the entire space. The SLLs are further suppressed by optimizing some of the unit cell states based on similar equivalent amplitude tailoring. Simulations and measurements of a set of 1 bit reflective metasurfaces with 20  $\times $  20 unit cells verify that the phase-only control metasurface realizes SLL suppression to −13 dB for multiple beam directions from  $- 30^\circ $  to 30 ° with a 10° step under normal plane wave incidence.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3184968","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001101,61960206006); Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20200349); Ministry of Education of Singapore(grant numbers:R-263-000-E86-112); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9807634","1 bit;phase control;plane waves;reflective metasurface;sidelobe level (SLL);single-beam","Metasurfaces;Optimization;Surface waves;Planar arrays;Control systems;Symmetric matrices;Transmission line matrix methods","","13","","24","IEEE","27 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the off-center placement, the radiation pattern of the monopole is not omnidirectional anymore, with ripples in the H-plane measured by un-roundness. The RIS is introduced above and in parallel with the finite ground plane and the monopole is placed in the center of the RIS. Characteristic mode analysis (CMA) is used to analyze the RIS-loaded monopole and to reveal the mechanism. It is found that two desired modes determine the bandwidth of the omnidirectional radiation together. The resonant frequency of the RIS mode can be easily tuned by changing the sheet impedance of the RIS. A metal-dielectric-metal constructed MTS is proposed to realize the RIS. The grid impedance of the MTS can be tuned easily by changing the size of the patch in the unit cell. For a single monopole placed off-center above a rectangular ground plane (150 mm  $\times300$  mm), the impedance bandwidth is increased from 19.6% to 32.4% with  $\vert \text{S}_{11}\vert < -10$  dB at  $f_{0} =2.5$  GHz. And the maximum un-roundness is reduced by 66.7% from 4.8 to 1.6 dB over the frequency band of 2.2–2.8 GHz. For a two-monopole antenna system with the same ground plane mentioned above, the loading MTS increases the impedance bandwidth of the monopole from 19.2% to 32.4% with  $\vert \text{S}_{11}\vert < -10$  dB at  $f_{0} =2.5$  GHz. When only one monopole is loaded with MTS in the system, the maximum un-roundness is reduced by 65.5% from 5.5 to 1.9 dB in the frequency band of 2.2–2.8 GHz.

Next, at each band, the spin-decoupled meta-atom is designed to realize the independent control for dual circular polarizations. Subsequently, the designed MS illuminated by CP feed source would generate left-hand CP (LHCP) beam with OAM mode +1 and right-hand CP (RHCP) beam with OAM mode −1 at Ku-band; meanwhile, the LHCP beam with OAM mode +2 and the RHCP beam with OAM mode −2 are generated at Ka-band. Finally, the MS is designed, manufactured, and measured. Both simulated and measured near-field and far-field performance verify that the proposed MS can generate four independent CP OAM beams along the same spatial axis at dual bands.

In this article, we demonstrate the perfect transformation of linearly polarized (LP) surface waves into CP waves through cylindrical anisotropic holographic metasurfaces consisting of gradient H-shaped slits etched on the periodic circular patches. Especially, the linear-to-circular polarization conversion rate can always maintain a very high level for the beam synthesis no matter how the curvature of the metasurface changes, and such high-purity CP beams also demonstrate very good quality of steerable characteristics over conformal surfaces.

A reduced-basis approximation is taken into account to accurately and efficiently describe the electromagnetic field in a frequency band of analysis. The reduced-basis space is made up of snapshots of the electric field adaptively chosen on a physics-based greedy algorithm. Following a theoretical analysis starting from time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations, in- band eigenresonances are shown to significantly contribute to the electric field in the band of analysis. An impedance matrix transfer function description of the microwave circuit is used and a pole-residue expansion of this matrix-valued impedance transfer function is detailed. A fundamental physical property is identified, from which a straightforward a posteriori error estimator arises, namely, matrix residues in the pole-residue expansion of the impedance transfer function must be rank-1. This cheap computation is well-suited for fast greedy algorithm strategies in adaptive construction of the reduced-basis approximation. Contrary to what has been previously done, a straightforward physics-based greedy algorithm that does not need to scan the whole frequency band of interest to enrich the reduced-basis approximation is proposed.

Unlike existing parallel BEM solvers, we use a formulation that rigorously models the skin effect, which results in two coupled computational workloads. The external-problem workload models electromagnetic coupling between conductive objects, while the internal-problem workload describes field distributions within them. We propose a parallelization strategy that distributes these two workloads evenly over thousands of processing cores. The external-problem workload is balanced in the same manner as existing parallel solvers that employ approximate models for conductive objects. However, we assert that the internal-problem workload should be balanced by algorithms from the scheduling theory. The parallel scalability of the proposed solver is tested on three different structures found in both integrated circuits and metasurfaces. The proposed parallelization strategy runs efficiently on distributed-memory computers with thousands of CPU cores and outperforms competing strategies derived from existing methods.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3188403","Advanced Micro Devices; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Compute Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9827935","Electromagnetic modeling;high-performance computing;lossy conductors;parallel task scheduling (PTS);surface impedance;surface integral equations","Mathematical models;Conductors;Electromagnetics;Program processors;Computational modeling;Skin effect;Task analysis","","5","","56","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These characteristics make them attractive solutions, among others, for satellite communications or mobile radar antennas. Notwithstanding, available microstrip implementations are inherently narrow-band and heavily affected by conductor and surface wave losses. RAs based on grounded dielectric layers offer improved performance and flexibility in terms of shaping the phase reflection response. In either case, a large number of variables (induced by the need for independent adjustment of individual unit cell geometries) and the necessity of handling several requirements make the design process of reflectarrays a challenging endeavor. In particular, RA optimization is extremely expensive when conducted at the level of electromagnetic (EM) simulation models, otherwise necessary to ensure reliability. A practical solution is a surrogate-assisted design with the metamodels constructed for the RA unit elements. Unfortunately, conventional modeling methods require large numbers of training data samples to render accurate surrogates, which turns detrimental to the optimization process efficiency. This work proposes an alternative approach with the unit element representations constructed using deep learning with automated adjustment of the model architecture. As a result, design-ready surrogates can be constructed using only a few hundred samples, and the total RA optimization cost is reduced to only a handful of equivalent EM analyses of the entire array. Our approach is validated using an RA incorporating 3-D pyramidal-shaped elements and favorably compared to benchmark techniques.

It is based on a recursive multilevel field-of-view (image space) subdivision buffer approach, whereby a point’s status is determined by only checking against a small subset of elements. It is error-free and formulated to maintain efficiency for inhomogeneous meshes and grazing incidence, which result in concentration of projected elements in small areas of the buffer plane.

It is demonstrated that whereas the additive method leads to the same asymptotic field representation irrespective of the sign of the image, the multiplicative variant yields distinct results in these two cases, both of which differ from the unique result of the additive method. It is further found that the positive-image Ott–Clemmow method yields the well-known Norton formula, but the negative-image variant is inaccurate and predicts a zero field in the on-surface transmitter–receiver configuration. It is also demonstrated that the first-order multiplicative method yields an incomplete representation of the first order in the inverse distance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3184478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9806315","Half-space problem;Hertzian dipole;modified saddle point method;near-ground propagation;Norton surface wave","Additives;Surface waves;Reflection;Media;Electric fields;Systematics;Surface impedance","","1","","58","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, the EM scattering from a slit in an impedance boundary condition (IBC) plate with different surface impedances on its both sides placed on interface of two different chiral media is analyzed by the KP method for both right circularly polarized (RCP) and left circularly polarized (LCP) excitations. A chirality parameter is a more degree of freedom—than dielectrics—presented by a chiral medium to affect the EM scattering. Initially, Fresnel coefficients are calculated as closed-form formulas; then, the slit’s contribution is expressed in terms of unknown weighting functions. Next, the method automatically and analytically satisfies boundary and radiation conditions applying Weber–Schafheitlin (WS) integrals, which leads to infinite summations. The infinite summations are effectively truncated with high accuracy. Finally, the weighting functions and, subsequently, the EM scattering are calculated. A finite-element method (FEM) and a convergence analysis are carried out to validate the formulations. The effects of different parameters of the problem on the EM scattering are also analyzed. It is shown that the maximum scattered fields are occurred at non-specular angles. Also, this solution can be a facilitator to analyze the inverse scattering of the problem to determine the properties of the structure.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3187510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9818943","Chiral;electromagnetic (EM) scattering;impedance boundary condition (IBC);interface;Kobayashi potential;slit;Weber–Schafheitlin integral","Scattering;Surface impedance;Media;Dielectrics;Impedance;Electromagnetic scattering;Surface treatment","","3","","38","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We denote the technique as the extended RA for lossy media (xRA-LM). xRA-LM significantly improves upon the existing noniterative linear scattering approximations such as RA and Born approximation (BA) by providing a validity range for the permittivity of objects of up to 50 times greater than RA.

In this work, a multiple-incidence framework (MIF) is introduced by incorporating the information from multiple incidences into an extra dimension of data space, helping to enrich physical knowledge in DLSs. A 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) structure is further introduced to explore cross-frame information of the data space, which enables simultaneous utilizations of multiple-incidence information. The proposed MIF can be easily adapted into previous DLSs in the literatures, where two widely used DLSs including back-propagation scheme (BPS) and dominant current scheme (DCS) are used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework.

The formulation includes efficient boundary recognition as well as accurately initializing geodesic equations on the next trimmed surface. For boundary recognition, inscribed or peripheral polygons are constructed to estimate the boundary and to effectively initialize numerical methods of quadratic convergence to determine the exact exit point. To get the initial point and initial direction on the parametric domain of the next trimmed surface, two optimization problems are efficiently solved. The proposed algorithm is applicable even if first/second-order surface discontinuity is encountered during the transition. The proposed method is validated on canonical surfaces and nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surfaces for various trimming curves. Accurate computation of geodesic paths is observed.

However, in these techniques, the nature of the physical processes responsible for the randomness is not considered directly. Moreover, it is not clear how the model parameters are related to the physical environment. Recent research studies found that in random media, such as underwater, the exact physical processes in effect can significantly alter the distribution of the received signal intensity. In this article, a novel intensity distribution model is derived based on Rytov theory of propagation through weak turbulence.

Cross-correlations of the scattered signals received by individual array elements provide spatial frequency samples of the scene, from which the scene can be reconstructed via inverse Fourier transform. As the spatial frequency sampled by an antenna pair is dependent on the antenna baseline vector, dynamic rotation of the linear array generates sampling curves in the spatial frequency domain, providing a denser sampling function and a more accurate scene reconstruction. While traditional static interferometric imaging arrays utilize nearly an order of magnitude fewer antenna elements than phased arrays, our dynamic array concept relies only on a sparse linear array, further reducing the number of hardware elements required.

On the other hand, it has to be carried out at the level of full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation models, which incurs considerable computational expenses. Executing UQ tasks at practically acceptable costs can be realized using surrogate modeling methods; however, the construction of reliable metamodels is hindered by the curse of dimensionality. This article proposes a novel approach to the robust design of antenna structures, where the task is formulated to increase the maximum values of parameter deviations for which 100% fabrication yield is ensured. Low cost of the optimization process is enabled by incorporating feature-based regression models for rapid yield estimation, as well as the employment of the trust-region framework for adaptive adjustment of design relocation but also as a convergence safeguard. Our methodology is validated using three microstrip antennas, including two dual-band and a triple-band structure.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3187665","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:217771); Gdańsk University of Technology through the Argentum Triggering Research Grants Program—“Excellence Initiative—Research University”(grant numbers:DEC-41/2020/IDUB/I.3.3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9818855","Antenna design;design centering;fabrication tolerance;response features;uncertainty quantification (UQ)","Optimization;Antennas;Fabrication;Uncertainty;Analytical models;Costs;Task analysis","","16","","56","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Plane spiral OAM (PSOAM) mode-group (MG) technique as a reconfigurable beamforming method can be used for building a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) system to achieve the reduction in subchannel correlation, which benefits from the spiral phase distribution within the mainlobe. However, the demultiplexing process still depends on the MIMO algorithm, in which the receiver complexity is same as the conventional MIMO systems. In this article, a PSOAM MG orthogonal multiplexing communication link at the X-band using partial arc sampling receiving (PASR) scheme has been demonstrated experimentally. The MG channels have a good isolation of about 15 dB, and the existing performance can ensure the reliable 16-QAM wireless transmission. Besides, a real-time dual-channel video transmission experiment has been carried out to verify the channel isolation caused by MG’s orthogonality intuitively. More importantly, the demultiplexing procedure using the PASR scheme can be implemented by simple analog phase shifting operation with a lower receiver complexity compared with the conventional MIMO systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3188386","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB2201700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171409,61571391,61975177,U20A20164); Zhejiang Laboratory(grant numbers:2020LC0AD01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9827931","Mode-group (MG);orbital angular momentum (OAM);orthogonality;partial arc sampling receiving (PASR);wireless communication","Multiplexing;Receiving antennas;Spirals;MIMO communication;Directive antennas;Demultiplexing;Complexity theory","","10","","46","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Flight transponders used in collision avoidance systems advise pilots with information of potential collisions and avoidance resolutions. Some transponders are capable of transmitting the instantaneous position of the vehicle which might be turned off. To prevent autonomous flights from collisions, the transponder signals shall be used to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DoA). Recently, multimode antennas have been investigated for communication and localization purposes. Multimode antennas provide several orthogonal ports on a single radiator surface. This leads to a reduction of space and weight, which is of interest in airborne applications. To perform DoA estimation as well as communication, a suitable channel model is required. In this contribution, a channel model fulfilling the requirements for both multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication and DoA estimation is proposed. This channel model relies on the manifold matrix representation of the UAV under consideration. The derived description of a manifold matrix for the UAV use-case is used for an optimization to achieve a close to omnidirectional radiation pattern. Therefore, different optimization functions are derived and their performance is compared.

Therefore, in this article, the modeling of WBAN channels using spherical wave functions (SWFs) is utilized for antenna de-embedding and for deriving optimal antenna characteristics that maximize the transmission coefficient for the respective channel. It is evaluated how typical factors influencing WBAN channels (different body anatomies, body postures, and varying positions of the communication nodes) can be modeled statistically with SWF.

One possible impediment is that many prior systems perform worse in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) indoor scenarios than in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios or even fail to work. Nevertheless, realizing localization in both LoS and NLoS scenarios is indispensable for a viable system working in indoor environments. Since existing state-of-the-art solutions mainly aim to localize a target in LoS indoor scenarios, we present a system that uses multipath channel parameters to achieve localization with a single AP in indoor NLoS scenarios. The proposed introduces deployable and simple custom-designed radio relays to assist localization, which can receive signals from the target and forward them to the AP in NLoS scenarios. Field trials conducted in a real NLoS scenario show that our system achieves a median 3-D localization accuracy of 86 cm with a uniform circular array (UCA) in most NLoS conditions, i.e., the direct path from a target to AP is not completely blocked. More importantly, even if in a challenging NLoS condition, i.e., the direct path does not exist, our system can still achieve a median 2-D localization accuracy of 85 cm.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3191222","Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJQN202100647); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9834216","3-D indoor localization;multipath propagation;non-line-of-sight (NLoS);radio relay;uniform circular array (UCA)","Location awareness;Relays;Reflection;Antenna arrays;OFDM;Reflector antennas;Estimation","","4","","51","IEEE","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The simulations were done using anatomically accurate as well as spheroid models of the insects. The maximum absorbed power, which ranged from 7.55 to 389 nW for an incident electric field strength of 1 V/m for the studied insect types, was obtained at wavelengths comparable to the insects’ size. We created a log-linear model that can estimate absorbed power in insects with an average relative error of  $ < 43\%$  between 6 and 120 GHz using only the insects’ volume and the frequency as an input using the simulation results. In addition, our simulations showed a very high correlation ( $r > 0.95$ ) between the absorbed power predicted with anatomically accurate insect models and those predicted with spheroid models at the frequencies between 6 and 24 GHz.

A parasitical square loop is loaded for bandwidth enhancement at a lower frequency. In addition, four split rings with a small square loop are firstly adopted for antenna resonance tuning, the impedance bandwidth is thus improved effectively. The antenna size is only  $0.18\,\times \,0.18\,\times \, 0.22\,\,\lambda _{0}$  at the center frequency. The measured result of the fabricated prototype exhibits a relatively large operation bandwidth of 32.73% (VSWR < 1.6) with stable radiation patterns and relatively flat broadside gains. Moreover, to verify the feasibility of the proposed miniaturized antenna element in the base-station application, an array of  $2\,\times \, 4$  is further designed. The measured results of the array indicate isolation over 20 dB with an impedance bandwidth of 32%. Due to the good performance and compact feature, the proposed miniaturized broadband antenna element can find large application potential in multiband wireless communication base stations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209273","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010115001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971195,61931009); Natural Science Foundation of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202102020476); Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program(grant numbers:2017ZT07X032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906816","Base-station antenna;broadband antenna;dipole;dual-polarization;miniaturization","Dipole antennas;Broadband antennas;Impedance;Bandwidth;Antennas;Loaded antennas;Antenna arrays","","14","","18","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite a 260° phase range, the maximum aperture efficiency is 35.8% at an aperture dimension (F/D) ratio of 0.58, the highest aperture efficiency at the lowest F/D ratio among LCRAs designed to operate on the mmWave band. The proposed LC-based reflectarray unit cell (LC-RUC) has significantly low reflection loss compared to other LC-RUCs. Also, the bias topology of the proposed LC-RUC makes the LCRA capable of 2-D beam scanning. The beam-scanning range of the proposed LCRA is ±50° on the xoz plane and 0°–65° in the yoz plane at 9.55 GHz. A  $2 \times 2 $  patch array antenna is designed as the feed antenna to achieve a small F/D ratio system and ease of optimization. When designing the feed antenna, the number of elements or the element spacing is considered to achieve high feed efficiency.
