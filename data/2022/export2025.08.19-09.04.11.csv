Various electric and magnetic characteristic modes of a slotted patch antenna are investigated and utilized effectively to create a stable broadside radiation pattern, covering fifth-generation (5G) frequency bands from 24.25 to 40 GHz. To implement this, the lifted ground (LGND) concept is applied to achieve a 57.1% impedance bandwidth for a single antenna element. In addition, the three resonances of the antenna can be manipulated independently. The use of differential feeding allows more than 36 dB of port-to-port isolation across the entire operating band. The measured gains of the single element and  $2\times $  2 array are 8.4 and 13.4 dBi, respectively. Also, the measured results indicate symmetrical E- and H-plane radiation patterns and cross-polarization levels lower than −26 dB.

Different from the traditional differential feeding structure, the proposed method has four physical feeding points on the patch. Our analysis results indicate that the proposed feeding approach can not only effectively excite the desired fundamental TM $_{\mathbf {01}}$  mode but also flexibly allow for the elimination of high-order modes by selecting suitable feeding positions. Just relying on this feeding method, unwanted harmonic radiations can be totally removed up to  $4{f} _{\mathbf {0}}$  without any additional elements. For demonstration, a prototype of a stacked patch antenna with filtering response has been then designed. With resorting to the proposed feeding scheme, both driven and stacked patches are indeed able to support good excitation of TM $_{\mathbf {01}}$  mode with other harmonics to be suppressed, leading to a wide upper stopband performance. In addition, several radiation nulls are generated in the stopband to improve the filtering selectivity. Measured results agree well with the simulated ones, indicating that the designed differential antenna possesses enhanced fractional impedance bandwidths, high in-band gains, low cross polarization, as well as intrinsic wide stopband rejection, further verifying the proposed feeding concept.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209184","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001243); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200756); Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications Scientific Foundation(grant numbers:NY220075); Science and Technology Development Fund of Macao (FDCT)(grant numbers:0095/2019/A2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906833","Differential patch antenna;filtering antenna;mode suppression;multi-point feeding;wide stopband","Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters;Filtering;Patch antennas;Resonant frequency;Manganese;Harmonics suppression","","15","","34","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed dual-reflector antenna breaks this tradeoff by drastically reducing the array formation time while maintaining the relative simplicity that comes with using a single transceiver element. It consists of a dual-mode horn feed, a rotating ellipsoidal subreflector, and a conic main reflector. The rotating subreflector creates a virtual phase center that rotates about an axis to produce a synthetic circular array with a diameter of  $120\lambda $ . The main reflector redirects the beams from each of these virtual phase centers to overlap and illuminate the scene over a wide field of view (FOV). Two cases are simulated, one with a 14° FOV and another with 25° FOV in both azimuth and elevation. The former case is experimentally verified and achieves a measured half-power beamwidth of 0.4° over the entire scan range. The proposed system can reduce the image acquisition time to the order of milliseconds/seconds, which makes real-time SAR imaging a practical alternative to multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) and phased arrays at millimeter-wave and sub-millimeter-wave frequencies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209276","endowment funds; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906858","3-D printed reflectors;digital beamforming;dual-reflector antennas;high-resolution 4-D imaging;millimeter-wave imaging radars;synthetic aperture radars (SARs)","Radar imaging;Phased arrays;Reflector antennas;Imaging;Feeds;Array signal processing;Transceivers","","18","","56","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Standing-Wave Microstrip Leaky-Wave Antenna on EH₁/EH₃ Modes With Enhanced Broadside Gain","H. -D. Li; L. Zhu","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"21 Dec 2022","2022","70","12","11313","11323","A conventional microstrip EH1-mode bidirectional leaky-wave antenna (LWA) usually works as a traveling wave antenna, and its typical maximum broadside gain is commonly obtained when the phase and leakage constants of the used EH1-mode are exactly equal to each other. In this article, it is, for the first time, revealed that this bidirectional LWA can alternatively operate under standing-wave states when its terminations may be open-circuited. Under some of these states, the open-terminated LWA attains higher efficiency due to the extremely small leakage constant. However, it is unfortunately illustrated that split beams are generated at these concerned states owing to the inherent opposite directions of equivalent magnetic current distributions along the two edges of the strip conductor. In order to transform the unwanted split beams into a single high-gain beam at the broadside, a novel standing-wave bidirectional LWA is presented under the operation of the hybrid EH1 and EH3 propagating modes. By analyzing the transversal electric fields of EH1- and EH3-modes, respectively, it is demonstrated that their leaky electric fields can be crucially made in an antiphase manner. Next, the EH3-mode electric field is employed to periodically replace the original EH1-mode counterpart, so as to reshape the electric fields along the two parallel radiating edges toward a desired in- phase pattern. In such a way, the appealing high-gain beam can be successfully achieved. As an example, such a hybrid-mode standing-wave bidirectional LWA is designed, simulated, and tested. The measured and simulated far-field radiation performances show excellent agreement, and they both powerfully indicate that our reported antenna has enhanced its radiation gain at the broadside compared to the conventional EH1-mode traveling-wave bidirectional LWA","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209193","National Natural Science Foundation of China; General Program(grant numbers:61971475); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:0095/2019/A2,0085/2020/AMJ); University of Macau(grant numbers:CPG2021-00003-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906836","Broadside radiation;enhanced radiation gain;hybrid modes;standing-wave leaky-wave antenna (LWA)","Microstrip antennas;Impedance;Power transmission lines;Leaky wave antennas;Substrates;Structural beams;Patch antennas","","4","","41","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with traditional methods, the TCM provides a method and theory to design a conformal implantable antenna with MIMO properties. The designed antenna has the advantage of simple structure, low space occupation, and little multipath reflection. The newly designed structure adopts two planar helical radiators to achieve size miniaturization. Some I-type patches are located between two radiators and slotting structures on the ground plane to reduce coupling. The biocompatible flexible polyimide is used as a dielectric substrate, enabling the conformal property and compatibility with the human tissue. Measurements of the fabricated prototype have been finished in the minced pork and skin-mimicking gel.

The FDRA consists of two same rectangular DRs embedded in air cavities, which are fixed by the hollowed substrate rings. A T-shape feeder, rectangular feeder, and metalized holes are introduced to excite the fundamental  ${\mathrm {TE}}_{\delta 11}^{x}$  mode of DRA. The substrate rings and DR are regarded as a composite dielectric to miniaturize the antenna and have effects on the radiation nulls. Because of the different loading effects from the different feeders, the resonance frequency of the  ${\mathrm {TE}}_{\delta 11}^{x}$  mode excited by the different feeders is slightly different. Therefore, a wide bandwidth can be achieved. In the hybrid feed scheme, three radiation nulls are introduced near the edge of the frequency band without an extra filtering circuit. To improve the suppression level, the effective size of the radiator is increased by increasing the width of the substrate rings without changing the size of the whole structure. Therefore, two prototype antennas with different widths of substrate rings are designed, manufactured, and measured. Good agreement can be observed between simulated and measured results.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209199","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001324); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020TQ0223); National Natural Science Foundation of China for Key Project(grant numbers:61831017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906872","Composite dielectric;dielectric resonator antenna (DRA);filtering antenna;self-packaging;substrate-integrated suspended line (SISL)","Substrates;Antennas;Filtering;Antenna feeds;Dielectrics;Antenna measurements;Resonant frequency","","14","","32","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Distinct from the conventional low-RCS PCMS, a metallic surface with etched open and closed slits is integrated into a PCMS consisting of double L-shaped particle pairs. Due to the edge capacitance induced by open slits and the surface inductance imposed by closed slits, the PCMS is endowed with reactance features that act as a perturbation to modulate the near-field interactions, thereby expanding the polarization conversion bandwidth. Besides, the reactance-loaded metallic surface, which has the same period as L-shaped particle pairs, combined with the grounded substrate, constitutes a broadband metasurface radiator. With the help of characteristic mode analysis, a linearly polarized aperture-coupled PCMS antenna is proposed, which effectively stimulates two resonant modes with broadside radiation to help bring about a broad operating bandwidth of 45.52%. Subsequently, the checkerboard-layout PCMS array is coupled to a sequentially feeding network through apertures on the ground plane, implementing a circularly polarized MTA with a broad 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth of 20.11%.

To solve this problem, this article proposes a method to realize a filtering series-feed V2X antenna. This antenna consists of two radiators connected to a double-sided parallel strip line (DSPSL). The DSPSL operates as the series-feed structure and the first resonator. The radiators function as the second resonator. An equivalent filtering network is analyzed and derived. Then, based on the filter synthesis, the initial design parameters are obtained to realize a second-order bandpass response. However, the synthesis method only involves  $S_{11}$  and efficiency ( $S_{21}$ ). The radiation performances are not concerned and satisfied. To solve this problem, the antenna currents are manipulated to generate the taper exciting. Thus, the upper sidelobe and the gain are improved. Moreover, to further enhance the out-of-band suppression level, three radiation zeros are generated by manipulating the current distribution on the DSPSL. The fabrication prototype demonstrates that the out-of-band suppression of the proposed antenna is better than 8.8 dB, which significantly reduces the mutual coupling.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209699","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62031016); Huawei Device Co., Ltd., China(grant numbers:YBN2020095024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9908480","Double-sided parallel strip line (DSPSL);filter synthesis;filtering antenna;series feed;vehicle-to-everything (V2X)","Filtering;Antennas;Integrated circuit modeling;Vehicle-to-everything;Equivalent circuits;Power transmission lines;Current distribution","","7","","26","IEEE","3 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, both the active VSWR and the array gain pattern are formulated as analytical expressions with respect to amplitude and phase excitations for analyzing the design freedom of edge effects. Aimed at suppressing the edge effects within an ultrawideband operation band, a nonconvex optimization problem is established for the synthesis of tightly coupled dipole arrays (TCDAs), where array gains at considered scanning angles and frequencies satisfying given maximum active VSWR and amplitude dynamic range ratio (DRR) are maximized. The nonconvex problem is transformed into an iterative convex optimization problem by the use of an iterative way, and the amplitude and phase excitations are efficiently solved by the convex optimization algorithm accordingly. By comparing to the traditional uniform amplitude and progressive phase excitation (UAPPE) method, the simulated and measured results of the ultrawideband TCDA show that the proposed method can slightly improve array gains at most frequencies, while the active VSWRs are suppressed to 3 over a 10:1 bandwidth when scanning up to 45°.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209158","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101103,61721001); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M683284,2022T150094); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906801","Convex optimization;edge effects;tightly coupled antenna arrays (TCAAs);ultrawideband phased arrays","Finite element analysis;Antenna arrays;Phased arrays;Wideband;Ultra wideband antennas;Dipole antennas;Baluns","","17","","48","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it leads to high design complexity due to the lack of structural repetitiveness. Different from the previous idea, the periodicity of the subarray tiling configuration is broken by introducing asymmetrical feeding phase into subarrays in this article. Specifically, a regular subarray tiling configuration (RSTC) is proposed, and it is obtained by replication and flipping of a regular subarray with asymmetrical feeding phase. In this way, the structural repetitiveness is achieved, while the periodicity of the RSTC is broken. Furthermore, to enhance the beam scanning ability, the aperiodicity of the RSTC is maximized by minimizing the predictability of the RSTC, based on the anticorrelation relationship between the aperiodicity and the predictability. Numerical results show that compared with the irRSTC, the proposed RSTC can expand the beam scanning range by 10° and improve the directivity of larger angle scanning by 2.9 dB only at an expense of 1.9 dB reduction at the boresight. Besides, the design complexity of the proposed RSTC is reduced to 1/64 of that of the irRSTC for a 16  $\times16$  array.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209709","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807404); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9908460","Aperiodicity;invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm;predictability;structural repetitiveness;subarray tiling configuration","Phased arrays;Complexity theory;Gratings;Apertures;Prediction algorithms;Optimization;Predictive models","","21","","45","IEEE","3 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on our novel approach, the desired RF frequency, a sub-6 GHz signal, is first up-converted to a mm-wave frequency, where it undergoes the desired processing (i.e., the required time delays are introduced), and then it is down-converted back to the initial RF frequency for transmission through the antenna array.

It contains at most only two admittances and one complex turns ratio. The real parts of these admittances can be assured to be nonnegative, an interesting aspect in the modeling of lossy surfaces such as those present in absorbers. Moreover, due to the capability of decomposition into the eigenexcitations of the structure, the circuit provides an important physical insight. Different cases of scatterers have been analyzed: symmetric and asymmetric, and lossy and lossless. In all these cases, modeling of the circuit admittances has been successfully achieved with a few positive and frequency-independent RLC elements. In the case of structures with symmetries, the turns ratio directly reflects the physical orientation of the scatterer eigenexcitations. Furthermore, in the case of lossy scatterers without symmetries, the resulting equivalent circuit reveals that their eigenexcitations are not linear polarizations, but elliptic polarizations whose properties are described by a complex turns ratio.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209226","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades (MCIU), the Agencia Estatal de Investigación (AEI), and the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) (Programa Estatal de I+D+i Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad)(grant numbers:RTI2018-097098-J-I00); Regional Government (Junta de Andalucía) PAIDI 2020(grant numbers:PY20_00452); Universidad de Málaga(grant numbers:UMA20-FEDERJA-001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906786","Bi-periodic;eigenstates;equivalent circuits;frequency-selective surfaces;lattice network;rasorber;reflectarray;scatterer;transmitarray","Integrated circuit modeling;Topology;Equivalent circuits;Surface impedance;Admittance;Transformers;Scattering parameters","","4","","32","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, the theory of the analytical modeling of periodic planar metasurfaces, placed on a dielectric substrate for normal incidence, is extended to general oblique cases. This method is based on an independent analysis of the electromagnetic behavior of the constituent particles and the interactions of the particles with each other. Since the interaction coefficients are calculated analytically, this method is time effective. The reflectance and transmittance of different substrated metasurfaces under oblique incidence, which is obtained from our proposed method, are compared to the results of numerical full-wave simulations. Two different cases are considered here—a metasurface consisting of isotropic spherical particles and a more general case of a bianisotropic metasurface composed of SRR inclusions.

Consequently, a novel bias signal design tool is proposed to significantly reduce the transition times of LC cells and hence of electrically large antennas composed of them.

Here, we propose the concept of localized loss engineering in electromagnetic (EM) metasurfaces, showing that an ordinary symmetric retroreflector can be switched to an extraordinary asymmetric one by introducing absorptive defects in local regions. The asymmetric performance begins with zero at the Hermitian state, gradually increases under non-Hermitian localized loss modulation, and reaches the maximum at the exceptional point (EP). The metasurface at the EP exhibits extremely asymmetric performance without the need of deeply discretized subwavelength elements. As a proof of concept, the localized loss-assisted asymmetric reflection is experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies via the observation of near-field distributions and far-field scatterings from a planar metasurface. Our methodology opens new opportunities for engineering EM systems with small perturbations and designing reconfigurable or multifunctional metadevices.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209282","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62171407,11961141010,61975176); Top-Notch Young Talents Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906870","Asymmetric reflection;exceptional point (EP);loss;metasurfaces;non-Hermitian","Metasurfaces;Reflection;Diffraction;Surface impedance;Slabs;Optical losses;Tuning","","12","","53","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, in order to reduce the influence of high-order modes above U-band, the space mapping (SM) technique was introduced to optimize the absorber’s parameters, which greatly expanded the high-frequency absorption bandwidth.

Traditionally, the electromagnetic FWI is usually performed using the  $L_{2}$  norm misfit function, which suffers severely local minimum problems since the  $L_{2}$  norm misfit function is nonconvex in the model space. To mitigate the local minimum problem, the quadratic Wasserstein metric ( $W_{2}$ ) derived from the optimal transport theory is proposed to replace the  $L_{2}$  norm to define the misfit function. Since the computation of the  $W_{2}$  metric requires the signal to be mass conservation and nonnegativity, the softplus function is applied to rescale the signal to meet these two requirements. Based on the softplus scaling method, a hierarchy inversion strategy that involves multiple scaling coefficients is proposed to mitigate the local minimum problem without sacrificing the inversion resolution. The numerical experiments prove that the FWI based on  $W_{2}$  ( $W_{2}$ -FWI) is more independent on the initial model than the FWI based on the  $L_{2}$  norm ( $L_{2}$ -FWI), and the  $W_{2}$ -FWI could be more robust to zero-mean random noise than the  $L_{2}$ -FWI.

This is achieved by extending the current methods, which are restricted to dipolar responses and weak spatially dispersive effects, so as to include quadrupolar responses and higher-order spatially dispersive components.

First, each PRS element is constructed using a pair of parallel-coupled slotline sections with open-short-ends, which are etched on vertically and horizontally inserted single-layer printed circuit boards (PCBs), respectively. Then, under vertically polarized incident waves, one of the slotline sections can convert the incident spatial waves into guided waves through its open end. After which, the guided waves are coupled to the other slotline section and the electric field direction will be rotated by 90° through the coupling path, thus leading to a 90° polarization rotation. Subsequently, a direct coupling matrix is used to synthesize and design the proposed PRS based on the microwave filter theory. Investigations reveal that a desirable bandpass filtering response can be obtained by properly designing the internal coupling of the parallel-coupled slotline sections and the external coupling between the incident spatial waves and the PRS. To validate the design concept, two examples with different fractional bandwidths at the same center frequency of 5 GHz and the same return loss of 20 dB were designed, fabricated, and measured. Consequently, a good agreement was attained among the results from coupling matrices, full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations, and measurements. All the results demonstrate that the proposed PRSs feature simple topologies, easy fabrications, low insertion losses (ILs), high polarization-rotating ratios, and stable filtering performances under large oblique incidences.

Furthermore, in the guided mode, it is seen that both slow wave (SW) and backward wave (BW) exist due to the inherently skewed boundary of the helical geometry. The parametric study of helix radius and pitch angle as well as dielectric constant gives optimized parameter values, which help in designing the proposed structure in the desired mode and at the desired frequencies. Moreover, it is reported that pitch angle aids in controlling and figuring out the leaky mode bandwidth. The analytical cum numerical MATLAB results are successfully verified using CST Microwave Studio computational analysis and are found to be in good agreement.

It instead leverages an indirect Müller formulation in terms of free-space Green functions that entails integration over the entire unbounded penetrable boundary. The integral equation domain is effectively reduced to a small-area surface by means of the windowed Green function (WGF) method, which exhibits high-order convergence as the size of the truncated surface increases. The resulting (second-kind) windowed integral equation is then numerically solved by means of the standard Galerkin method of moments (MoM) using the Rao–Wilton–Glisson (RWG) basis functions. The methodology is validated by comparison with the Mie series and Sommerfeld integral exact solutions as well as against an LGF-based MoM.

R3M aims to accelerate the EM validations of DCMs with varied codebooks, which involves the analysis of a group of similar but not identical structures. The method transforms general DCMs to rigorously periodic arrays by replacing each coding unit with the macro unit, which comprises all possible coding states. The system matrix corresponding to the rigorously periodic array is globally shared for DCMs with arbitrary codebooks via implicit retrieval. The discrepancy of the interactions for edge and corner units is precluded by the basis extension of periodic boundaries. Moreover, the hierarchical pattern exploitation (HPE) algorithm is leveraged to efficiently assemble the system matrix for further acceleration. Due to the full utilization of the rigid periodicity, the computational complexity of R3M-HPE is theoretically lower than that of  $\mathcal {H}$ -matrix within the same paradigm. Numerical results for two types of DCMs indicate that R3M-HPE is accurate in comparison with commercial software. Besides, R3M-HPE is also compatible with the preconditioning for efficient iterative solutions.

In the traditional VSIE formed by combining the surface electric field integral equation (EFIE) and volume integral equation (VIE), the fictitious surface charge, which does not exist physically, is accumulated on the PEC–dielectric interfaces. This will lead to the inaccuracy of numerical results, which can be eliminated by the CC. To correctly enforce the CC, the equivalent surface current distribution on both sides of open PEC should be distinguished. For this purpose, the combined field integral equation (CFIE) consisting of electric field and magnetic field integral equations is used to model the open PEC part. In the proposed approach, the number of surface unknowns needs to be doubled, which can be balanced by reducing the volumetric unknowns through the enforcement of CC. Furthermore, by fully considering the numerical symmetry between both sides of open PEC surface, the filling process of the matrix as well as the excitation vector in implementing the method of moments (MoMs) can be simplified. Numerical experiment demonstrates that the enforcement of CC can improve the VSIE accuracy obviously.

To circumvent this difficulty, the dispersive susceptibility of the medium is modeled by Padé approximants. It is proven that under certain conditions the Padé approximant is equal to a weighted sum of Debye terms, while the physical restrictions for positive weights and relaxation times are fulfilled with certainty. Hence, a set of first-order auxiliary differential equations (ADEs), which approximate the original fractional polarization relation, is derived and directly embedded in the FDTD scheme. In contrast to previous works, the derivation of the Debye expansion of the original dispersive permittivity is carried out in a straightforward manner without involving nonlinear optimization techniques.

For large-size platforms, the interference can be reduced by compromising the aperture efficiency, and this tradeoff is the metric to quantify the effective use of the platform. This metric fails for antenna platforms that are not electrically large, for which the aperture efficiency is no longer a useful parameter. Here we resort to the concept of the observable field, related to the maximum theoretical directivity, to estimate the potential number of independent links supported by moderate-size platforms. This allows the introduction of coupling coefficients between the beams associated with the observable portion of the incident field and the beams associated with the receiving antennas. These coefficients are bounded to unity for any platform dimension, unlike the aperture efficiency, and they are maximized when the antenna pattern is equal to the pattern predicted by the observable field. Accordingly, selecting beams dictated by the observable field constitutes a benchmark for the effective use of the volume. Any antenna design can be compared to this benchmark to assess its merits.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209203","HUAWEI Technologies Sweden AB, UNB Project(grant numbers:YBN2020045031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906851","Interference;line of sight (LoS);multi-beam antennas;observable field;signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)","Antennas;Couplings;Receiving antennas;Aperture antennas;Measurement;Interference;Benchmark testing","","1","","24","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To have a fast and accurate path loss prediction, this article applies a deep learning-based image-to-image translation technique to construct a path loss model in urban environments. The proposed method combines a variational autoencoder with a generative adversarial network to translate images from the domain of street maps to the domain of path loss. It is trained in a supervised manner using paired samples, where the input is the street map with 3-D building information and the output is the path loss in the area obtained from the ray-tracing model. Based on a realistic digital map of urban Taipei city, simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms conventional ones when operating at the 3.5 GHz frequency band. The standard deviation of prediction error is reduced by over 62%. Besides prediction accuracy, the proposed model has the advantage of low computational complexity over ray-tracing techniques. Hence, it has great potential for the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted base stations (UAV-BSs) for future communication systems.

In this article, a subspace-based CGM (S-CGM) is proposed to improve the performance of the linearized CGM. This approach retrieves the deterministic part of the variational-induced current. Therefore, the total electric field is estimated by adding the variational-induced current. This new total electric field approximation is more accurate than that of the linearized CGM, and thus, it achieves a faster convergence speed and higher accuracy.

The problem is solved by the following steps: first, mathematically shift the reference phase origin (RPO) of the damaged far-field (FF) to the position of each element of the array one by one, then represent the shifted FFs with orthogonal mode, and then extract the base mode. In this way, the mapping from the element positions to the shifted base modes is established. Because the base mode is a sinc function of the off-center distance, the base mode shifted to the position of the faulty element will change significantly compared with the one shifted to its adjacent element. Since the larger sampling interval will not cause the base modes aliasing, the method can fast locate the faulty elements from sparse sampling (close to but less than twice the Nyquist interval). Compared with the existing methods based on compressive sensing and genetic algorithms, the proposed method avoids the prior knowledge of the failure-free array radiation pattern and the iteration solution, which can remarkably reduce the time of the measurement and data postprocessing.

While most often performed in a local sense, it still entails considerable computational expenses when carried out at the level of full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation models. Moreover, the optimization outcome may be impaired if a good initial design is not available. This article proposes a novel approach to fast and improved-reliability gradient-based optimization of antenna structures. Our approach employs a frequency-based regularization to facilitate the relocation of antenna operating parameters to their target values, which increases the chances of identifying a satisfactory design under challenging conditions (e.g., poor-quality starting point). At the same time, the computational efficiency of the tuning process is enhanced through the involvement of variable-resolution EM models, and restricting the finite-differentiation (FD) sensitivity updates to selected parameters only. The latter is decided upon based on the analysis of the design relocation between the subsequent iterations of the optimization algorithm. The presented technique is validated using three examples of microstrip antennas optimized under different scenarios (matching improvement, gain enhancement, and size reduction). The results demonstrate superior performance in terms of reliability and design quality as compared to conventional gradient-based and derivative-free search procedures. At the same time, a significant speedup is achieved over the frequency-regularization-based procedure not using the acceleration mechanisms.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209281","The Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:217771); National Science Centre of Poland(grant numbers:2020/37/B/ST7/01448); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906815","Antenna optimization;frequency-based regularization;restricted sensitivity updates;simulation-based design;variable-fidelity simulations","Antennas;Optimization;Sensitivity;Linear programming;Tuning;Computational modeling;Computational efficiency","","9","","99","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Indeed, such modalities are noninvasive, nonionizing, and low cost and proceed without registration for free pending breasts, not like other joint modalities that impose compression. Because of the strongly contrasted electromagnetic parameters of breast constituents, MW yields high-contrast images of low resolution and converse with the US when faced with weakly refracting elements. The key benefit is the common breast structure, and fusion should produce images with both high contrast and resolution. A Bayesian formalism is chosen, and an unsupervised joint variational Bayesian approximation (JVBA) is developed. In that, edges’ hidden variables and hyperparameters are automatically tuned along with the optimization. The mathematics is detailed in a general setting of fusion, and then, one proposes imaging of realistic MRI-derived breast slices. A wealth of numerical simulations from noisy single-frequency MW and multiple-frequency US data preserved from inverse crime yields means (i.e., breast maps) and variances of the unknown electromagnetic and acoustic parameter distributions as probabilistic realizations, evolutions of hyperparameters, as well as global indicators of accuracy.

First, the AUT is connected to three standard loads, a short, an open, and a matched load consecutively. Then an electrostatic discharge (ESD) is used as an impulsive source to excite the AUT. Concurrently, a probe connected to an oscilloscope captures the impulse responses. Finally, the input impedance of the AUT is determined by extracting complex natural resonances (CNRs) from three impulse responses. Four different antennas are designed and prototyped.

The idea is to extract as much useful signal (relating to the tag information or tag ID) from the total signal using a dedicated bistatic reading configuration. This extraction step is implemented from a hardware point of view, which is different from classical approaches based on signal processing. Indeed, based on this technique, it is possible to read tags even in highly reflective environments (metallic surfaces) without applying a calibration method, such as subtracting the environment without the tag or advanced postprocessing steps. For this purpose, a bistatic antenna configuration is employed, where the angle between the incident wave and the backscattered signal is chosen to maximize copolarization configuration. First, a model based on the general scatter theory is evaluated; it highlights the scattering mechanism involved in the problem. Then, a proof of concept (PoC) is evaluated, and afterward, a chipless tag composed of an array of dipoles is studied for identification purposes. The analytical evaluation and the channel modeling allow a general implementation of the proposed technique. Anechoic and real scenario measurements are evaluated considering the presence of surrounding objects. Finally, nonsystematic errors related to the positioning of the tag are considered each time without considering a reference (or background) measurement or the use of specific signal processing techniques.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209223","University Grenoble Alpes; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:772539); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906793","Bistatic measurement;chipless radio frequency identification (RFID);detection reliability;frequency-domain reading method;scattering pattern","Semiconductor device measurement;Resonant frequency;Antenna measurements;Calibration;Antenna arrays;Time-domain analysis;Clutter","","2","","24","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, the electric-field distributions of the traditional MPA are theoretically studied by using characteristic mode analysis (CMA). The results demonstrate that the of electric-field nulls could be bent by combining its two modes. Hence, when the antenna is excited at the left port, electric-field nulls could be formed around the right port. In contrast, electric-field nulls are formed on the left port for the MPA under excitation of the right port. Next, a set of shorting pins is loaded below the radiating patch. Hence, the MPA reallocates the resonant frequencies of these dual modes closely to each other and combines them for low mutual coupling. After that, the slot is cut on the radiator, aiming to improve the impedance matching over the operating band. With these arrangements, the mutual coupling of the MPA between dual ports is successfully decreased with good impedance matching. In final, the proposed MPA is fabricated and measured. Good agreement between the simulated and measured results is obtained, and it proves that the  $\vert S_{11}\vert < -10$  dB of the antenna is operated in a range from 5.3 to 5.54 GHz. Besides, the antenna maintains the low-profile, single-layer, and single-element properties. Most importantly, it has generated a broadside radiation pattern with the same polarization, and its isolation is satisfactorily enhanced to above 17 dB, which is much higher than the 3.5 dB of the traditional counterpart.

As a result, the MTS works as a radiator and a filter simultaneously. A  $3\times3$  array MTS antenna is implemented to demonstrate the concept. Targeting the broadside radiation pattern and 5G operating band, two candidate MTS modes are selected. A ground slot is used to excite them and introduce an extra slot mode.

Using superposition and linearity, the spatial impedance distribution of the FSS is calculated. The devised FSS consists of indented patch elements consisting of four symmetric via structures to exhibit a wide tunable transmission phase range and less than 1 dB insertion loss at the center frequency of 30.0 GHz for proof-of-concept. The proposed scattering mitigation FSS is verified in transverse magnetic (TMz)- and transverse electric (TEz)-polarized cylinder scattering scenarios. The measurement confirms the improvements of the main beam peak gain and restoration of far-field radiation patterns. The proposed investigation is expected to provide concise and practical scattering reduction solutions for blockage scenario such as vehicular communication in urban areas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209720","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant through the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2020-0-00858,2021-0-00763); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9908451","Blockage mitigation;cloaking;frequency-selective surface (FSS);scattering","Scattering;Electric fields;Antenna radiation patterns;Electromagnetic scattering;Antenna feeds;Propagation losses;Horn antennas","","6","","21","IEEE","3 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, a single patch resonator (PR) loaded with two sets of shorting pins is theoretically studied by using the characteristic mode analysis (CMA) method and by applying periodic boundary conditions, respectively. The results demonstrate that the radiation pattern and resonant frequency of TM00 mode in the PR can be effectively reshaped and controlled by the shorting pins, so that the TM00 and TM01 modes can be simultaneously excited under the normal incidence of a plane wave. As such, the single-mode PR is transformed into a DMPR. Moreover, such DMPRs are arranged in a back-to-back manner with coupling apertures etched on the common middle metallic layer to form an AC-DMPR-based bandpass FSS element. By reasonably reallocating the resonant frequencies of these two resonant modes and etching different apertures to provide magnetic and/or electric couplings in the AC-DMPR, single- and dual-band high-order bandpass FSSs can be conveniently and flexibly constructed, respectively. Finally, the conceptual designs are validated by measurements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209659","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFE0205900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071243,61971475); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:0085/2020/AMJ,0095/2019/A2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9908476","Aperture-coupled dual-mode patch resonators (AC-DMPR);bandpass response;dual-band;frequency selective surfaces (FSSs)","Resonators;Pins;Resonant frequency;Couplings;Dual band;Antenna radiation patterns;Filtering","","12","","30","IEEE","3 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is based on compact closed-form expressions of mutual impedance among filamentary sinusoidal monopoles. Using piecewise sinusoidal basis functions, the mutual impedance of thick-wire sections can be computed through an azimuthal integration of the mutual impedance between filamentary dipoles. Each element of impedance matrix is calculated through a rapidly convergent single integral only. This is unlike other MoM techniques, where double or triple integrals are needed to evaluate impedance matrix. In our formulation, it has been assumed that the wire current is uniform in azimuth, and changes along the axial direction only. No approximation on the segment length or radius of the thick-wire is made, and hence our formulation remains efficient for arbitrarily long/thick antennas.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209277","Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021B1515120029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906838","Magnetic frill;method of moments (MoM);monopole;thick-wire","Impedance;Manganese;Wires;Method of moments;Dipole antennas;Antennas;Kernel","","6","","40","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To evaluate energy, momentum, and force in the YL-FDTDM, electric and magnetic fields must be colocated in both space and time. Colocation operations can be computationally intensive while introducing implementation complexity and numerical error. As an alternative to the YL-FDTDM, the Hauser and Verhey electrodynamic lattice-Boltzmann method (HV ELBM) is implemented on a single lattice representing electric and magnetic fields at the same location and time. Since colocation is not required on a single lattice, its central differences are simpler to implement and more accurate. Continuous plane-wave scattering of electric and magnetic fields from a nondispersive dielectric sphere is solved using the YL-FDTDM, the HV ELBM, and Mie scattering analysis. The YL-FDTDM and HV ELBM are compared in terms of numerical error and computational time representing the analytical Mie solution for the Einstein and Laub time-averaged force density. The HV ELBM requires less computational time to evaluate a time-averaged force density with half the error of the YL-FDTDM. At a similar absolute error, the HV ELBM evaluates a time-averaged force density in less than 10% of the computational time.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3209253","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906852","Finite-difference time-domain method;force density;lattice-Boltzmann method;Mie scattering;Yee-lattice (YL)","Force;Magnetic fields;Lattices;Electrodynamics;Kinetic theory;Time-domain analysis;Scattering","","2","","29","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second set (VPIE-2) uses the same condition as VPIE-1 for the tangential component of the vector potential but enforces its divergence to be zero. In both the sets, unknowns are the electric current and the normal component of the vector potential on the scatterer surface and are expanded using the Rao–Wilton–Glisson (RWG) and pulse basis functions, respectively. To achieve a conforming discretization, RWG, scalar Buffa–Christiansen (BC), and pulse testing functions are used.

Instead of taking advantage of the Toeplitz symmetry by discretizing integral equations (IEs), HPE partitions the array hierarchically to form considerably larger geometrical repetitions, which result in identical interaction blocks inside the system matrix. These interaction blocks representing patterns are characterized and hashed to generate a directory, which maps the patterns to the references of the submatrices. Due to the large proportion of repetitions in hierarchical matrix ( $\mathcal {H}$ -matrix), HPE accelerates the matrix assembly and reduces the required storage drastically. Numerical examples show that the HPE outperforms the classical  $\mathcal {H}$ -matrix by a large margin with much less storage and CPU time cost for the analysis of finite periodic arrays. Compared with the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) and the characteristic basis functions method (CBFM), HPE also demonstrates competitive performance, which validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3211742","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101408); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9915035","Finite periodic arrays;hierarchical matrix (H-matrix);hierarchical pattern exploitation (HPE);integral equations (IEs)","Integral equations;Method of moments;Transmission line matrix methods;Microwave antenna arrays;Layout;Green's function methods;Finite element analysis","","3","","26","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we overcome this drawback by proposing a unified simulation method for  $\alpha $ – $\mu $ ,  $\eta $ – $\mu $ , and  $\kappa $ – $\mu $  fading processes that accommodates full-range values of all the fading parameters. Not less important, the proposed method is simple, exactly matches the fading models’ first-order statistics, and well approximates their second-order statistics. We derive the analytical expressions for the proposed method and optimize a crucial simulation parameter to improve the match for the second-order statistics. In passing, we obtain useful series representations and asymptotic expressions for essential first- and second-order statistics of the fading models investigated.

The simulation results are compared with a reference set of data in terms of transmission coefficients and radiation patterns to evaluate the performance of the MPM in the probe-generated echo filtering procedure. To verify the functionality of the MPM in practice, two antennas are exploited as different probes to implement a spherical measurement system in a mini-anechoic chamber, which is developed for conducting the over the air (OTA) measurements of the fifth-generation (5G) antennas.
