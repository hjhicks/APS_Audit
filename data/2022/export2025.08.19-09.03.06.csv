The proposed antenna constructively combines a patch dipole (electric dipole radiation) and a folded loop antenna (magnetic dipole radiation), which are differentially excited by a longitudinal slot etched on the top layer of the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW). The combination of the proposed patch dipole and the folded loop antenna results in a paralleled electric dipole and magnetic dipole which can generate two orthogonal electric field components and 90° phase difference in the far-field radiation when they are in-phase excited. The proposed antenna achieves a wide impedance bandwidth of 46% from 48.47 to 77.46 GHz and a wide 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) of 47.3% from 51.64 to 83.61 GHz with an overlapped bandwidth of 40%. To further enhance the antenna gain, sequential rotation technique is adopted to construct a  $2 \times 2$  subarray, which is further employed in a  $4 \times 4$  subarray. The  $4 \times 4$  subarray is then used to construct an  $8 \times 8$  antenna array, which achieves a wide impedance bandwidth of 33.8% from 56.11 to 78.95 GHz and a wide 3 dB ARBW of 38.8% from 53.57 to 79.32 GHz, with a maximum antenna gain of around 25.2 dBic.

Herein, the tri-polarization consists of the left-handed circular polarization (LHCP), right-handed circular polarization (RHCP), and linear-polarization (LP). First, the resonant frequencies of the traditional MPA are deeply studied. It is demonstrated that a set of radiative modes are excited in a single patch resonator. In order to suppress a few undesired modes, an array of shorting vias is loaded around two edges of the quarter patch1. Then, a linear slot is introduced to move dual orthogonal modes closely to each other, resulting in achieving LHCP patterns with harmonic suppression. Similarly, both of RHCP patterns and harmonic suppression are acquired for the quarter patch2 via this method. After that, the shorting vias and slots are adopted on the half patch3, aiming to suppress or push up higher modes for LP generation and harmonic suppression. Lastly, all these three patches are integrated with each other for size reduction. Finally, the proposed MPA is fabricated and measured. The results illustrate that the antenna has satisfactorily gained LHCP, RHCP, and LP radiation patterns of around 2.65 GHz. Besides, the volume of the radiator ( $0.0058\lambda _{0}^{3}$ ,  $\lambda _{0}$  is the free-space wavelength) is only half of the traditional counterpart ( $0.01\lambda _{0}^{3}$ ). Additionally, the port isolation is kept as large as about 22 dB in the operating band. Most importantly, the harmonic suppression of around  $2.7~f_{0}$  ( $f_{0}$  is the operating frequency) is successfully acquired without extra feeding circuits.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3145440","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971475); University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00073-FST,FDCT0095/2019/A2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696222","Compact size;harmonic suppression;microstrip patch antenna (MPA);tri-polarization","Harmonics suppression;Resonant frequency;Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters;Patch antennas;Antennas;Polarization","","12","","34","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This antenna is a composite structure consisting of a novel width-tapered slotted substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) and an ALTSA fed by the SIW. The former also serves as a radiator to produce vertically polarized radiation, which is crucial to achieve a fully planar endfire CP antenna when a thin substrate is deployed. Compared to the previous ALTSA fed by the SIW, this proposed antenna utilizes slots on the spare broad walls of the SIW to form an extra slotted width-tapered SIW radiator, which presents an extension of the conventional width-uniform slotted SIW. Moreover, there are no space harmonics in the slotted width-tapered SIW; it is a slow wave that produces the vertically polarized radiation. The proposed antenna is demonstrated at 28 GHz, which is one of the millimeter-wave bands specified for 5G.

The radiation operator that maps the equivalent currents to the far-field is built from the outer dimensions of the antenna under test (AUT) and is discretized into the so-called radiation matrix using the methods of moments. This matrix is approximated up to the measurement accuracy by truncating its singular value decomposition (SVD) accordingly. This operation enables to construct numerically a reduced basis of the radiated fields. The dimension of this basis and consequently the number of field samples is shown to be determined by the area of the equivalent current convex surface, in agreement with the fundamental works on the minimum non-redundant samplings. The influence of the field sampling strategy and noise on the far-field pattern reconstruction is investigated to determine a realistic small number of field samples. Finally, the characterization of two radiating structures from the so-derived reduced number of samples validates experimentally the proposed approach and demonstrates its practical relevance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3118711","European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); French region of Brittany, Ministry of Higher Education and Research, Rennes Métropole and Conseil Départemental 35, through the CPER Project SOPHIE/STIC & Ondes; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573335","Antenna measurements;antenna radiation pattern;method of moments;reduced-order systems","Antenna measurements;Antenna radiation patterns;Surface impedance;Reduced order systems;Matrix decomposition;Mathematical models;Current distribution","","12","","34","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The annular hyperbolic lens regulates the spherical wavefront from the LP radiator into a cylindrical shape prior to propagating into the conformal artificial anisotropic polarizer. Each curved slab of the polarizer is conformally tilted 45° to the incident electric field. Therefore, the conformal polarizer is the three-dimensionalization of the 2-D planar artificial anisotropic polarizer. The polarizer designing methodology is the first of its kind to generate wideband CP wave omnidirectionally. The hyperbolic lens and the conformal polarizer are fabricated together using stereolithography (SLA) 3-D printing technology. The measurement results show that the antenna has a wide operating bandwidth of 45% (from 24 to 38 GHz), which completely covers potential 5G 28 GHz spectra.

This four-port antenna consists of a circular patch and a square patch, where the square patch is located above the circular patch. Taking into account the mutual coupling between four ports, the active reflection coefficient (ARC) is adopted to describe the impedance matching of the antenna, and a simplified form of ARC is derived. The abnormal electric field distribution generated in the square patch is attributed to the superposition of the electric fields of two orthogonal TM10 modes, which is theoretically verified. Due to the coupling between TM11 mode and TM10 mode, a new resonance mode appears in a square patch, where the abnormal electric fields on the two diagonals are generated simultaneously. The effect of the square patch on the circular patch is equivalent to a capacitor at the lower frequency end and the higher frequency end of −10 dB impedance bandwidth, while it acts as an inductor at the middle frequency band. Besides the horizontal patch of  $\lceil $ -shaped feed is sandwiched between two radiators to enhance coupling. Finally, a wideband feed network composed of Wilkinson power divider and phase shifter is devised to provide four signals of equal magnitude and quadrature phase for proposed antenna. To verify the design concept, a prototype is fabricated and measured. The results show that left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) radiation is achieved. The 3 dB gain variation bandwidth is 44.6%, ranging from 1.48 to 2.33 GHz, in which VSWR < 1.5 and AR < 1.5 dB.

The feeding structures of these two microstrip feedings and the separation are optimally designed to ensure the mutual coupling signals out-of-phase, and therefore, the signal cancellation can be achieved, leading to a high isolation between these two ports. In this design, the slot length is  $0.92\lambda $  at 24.125 GHz, forming an equivalent short circuit at the other port. Given the initial design criteria, the design with the optimal isolation could readily be found by minimal full-wave simulations. Meanwhile, the equivalent circuit model was used to investigate the working principles and to improve the isolation bandwidth and impedance matching at the central frequency.

The antenna consists of a circular, thin grounded dielectric layer printed by a texture of metallic patches modulated in shape and size. The patch layer can be modeled as a spatially variable capacitive impedance sheet, which together with the grounded slab contribution provides an overall, modulated, inductive boundary condition (BC). The antenna aperture is divided into four identical angular quadrants each of them radiating independent broadside beams when excited by an individual monopole launcher. Each of the four launchers excites a TM cylindrical surface wave (SW), which is progressively converted into a leaky-wave (LW) by the MTS. The four subapertures are virtually separated by properly designing the MTS modulation. To this end, the LW attenuation constant is calibrated for dumping sufficiently each individual SW, thus preventing the interaction between the adjacent regions. Therefore, the printed structure is not delimited by any physical separation, but only by a continuous change of the equivalent BCs. The monopulse-type linearly polarized  $\Sigma $ ,  $\Delta \Delta $ ,  $\Delta _{\mathrm{ E}}$ ,  $\Delta _{\mathrm{ H}}$  beams are obtained by combining the source excitation with a simple phasing scheme.

First, the working principle about how to excite multiple modes with the same order/electrical-length is theoretically investigated based on an equivalent transmission line model. Under this method, the antenna, in theory, breaks down the limitations in the number of applicable resonances and the number of available operating bands. Second, how to load parallel capacitor to shift resonant modes to the desired band is investigated, so as to achieve the enhanced-bandwidth in multiple working bands. With these arrangements, a simple dual-band ILA is proposed as an application example to highlight the merits of above approach. Herein, the same 0.25 and 0.75 wavelength modes are generated at different operating bands so that the balanced radiation performance can be well maintained at dual bands. This ILA has gained both the lower 4G band (1.71–2.69 GHz) and upper 5G band (3.3–4.2 GHz) as desired. As a result, it not only achieves two wide bandwidths of around 44.5% and 24%, but also keeps the electrically short length of around  $0.15\lambda _{0}$  and a small clearance of 3 mm.

Accordingly, we can enforce all reflected waves to constructively interfere with each other in all target directions. To feed the proposed reflectarray cells, an omnidirectional monopole antenna is installed at the center of the reflectarray, which illuminates the reflectarray evenly. In addition, because the monopole feeder is directly connected to the reflectarray, we can significantly reduce the overall volume of the antenna down to about  $0.5~\lambda ^{3}$  with a small F/D ratio of 0.147. Consequently, the proposed antenna attains a wide scan coverage and directional beam patterns.

In order to obtain lower scan loss over a wider beam coverage range (BCR), a multibeam optimization method considering the illumination weighting factor is introduced to obtain minimum phase errors for the designed beam direction. To improve antenna compactness and alleviate the mutual couplings among multiple feeding sources, small-size substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity-backed slot antennas are employed as the feeding sources, which are integrated with the single-layer reflector board. An incident-angle-insensitive circular polarizer is designed and integrated over the antenna aperture to achieve circularly polarized (CP) radiation over a wide BCR.

The newly proposed decoupling approach is implemented by symmetrically loading several U-type, I-type, and cross strips around the antennas to change the original couplings, so that two elements in the  $1\times2$  subarray can form a pair of phase-reversed coupling paths into adjacent element in different subarray for coupling cancellation. Then, the couplings from the subarray to adjacent element are effectively suppressed, thus the isolations between different subarrays of the array are promoted. Moreover, the method can be also applied in improving the isolation between different polarizations in the same subarray. In addition, these strips not only have little influence on radiation characteristics of the antenna array, but also can be etched on the antenna layer without extra profile and process. For demonstration, one dual- polarized patch antenna array based on the new decoupling mechanism is designed. The results indicate that all the isolations between the subarrays of the proposed dual-polarized antenna array can achieve a very high level of over 25 dB in an operation band of 3.4–3.6 GHz. Compared with other decoupling methods, the proposed method can simultaneously improve complex multiple-port isolations among different subarrays and different polarizations to realize a very high isolation with less impact on antenna radiation. Due to above features, the proposed decoupling mechanism is expected to find potential applications in 5G dual-polarized multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) antenna array.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137170","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010115001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971195,61931009); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515010897); Natural Science Foundation of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202102020476); Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program(grant numbers:2017ZT07X032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664468","Decoupling;dual polarization;energy cancellation;isolation;subarray","Couplings;Antenna arrays;Lead;Loading;Mutual coupling;Phased arrays;MIMO communication","","22","","19","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the CM analysis, radiating mode (RM) and decoupling mode (DM) of the antenna element are identified. An effective loading technique is proposed to enhance the modal significances of the DMs. The coupling between the DMs and the adjacent antenna element is enhanced, while the coupling with the dominant rms of the antennas is suppressed. Because of the coupling energy dispersion in the DMs, the corresponding unwanted induced currents flowing into the feed ports of the antenna element are suppressed, and the port isolations are efficiently improved.

Wideband polarization-independent FSS bandpass filters are predominantly made of multiple microwave dielectric substrates or noncommercially available composite materials with or without active components, contributing to a very high manufacturing cost. The presented FSS filter has neither microwave substrates, nor any active devices, while it has a large controllable operational frequency band, which can support all polarizations, due to its symmetrical configuration. To the best of our knowledge, such a polarization-independent wideband bandpass response has never been achieved by any low-cost fully metallic FSS filter. The proposed FSS filter is made of three thin metal sheets composed of an engineered metallic substrate (EMS) and a metallic orthogonal dipole resonator (ODR). The EMS is responsible for ensuring the mechanical integrity of the filter without imposing electromagnetic (EM) restrictions throughout the desired frequency band. The integration of EMS and ODRs realizes a fully controllable wideband bandpass verified thorough circuital and modal analyses. According to the predicted and measured results, the FSS filter has a large bandwidth of around 31%, extending from 8.76 to 11.96 GHz with sharp roll-offs for the normal incidence. Simulated and measured results show a low sensitivity of the FSS filter response to oblique angles of incidence for both TM and TE polarizations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3138256","Macquarie University Research Fellowship Grant; University of Technology Sydney, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (IT) Strategic Start-Up Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9676478","All-metal structures;bandpass response;frequency selective surface (FSS);laser technology;low-cost fabrication;metasurface;modular reconfigurability;polarization independence;radar;radome;space explorations;TE and TM polarizations;wideband","Frequency selective surfaces;Microwave filters;Band-pass filters;Resonator filters;Spatial filters;Resonant frequency;Wideband","","96","","42","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reflective flexible material metasurface formed by two switchable microfluidic layers— the top layer comprising an array of meandered half-rings and the lower layer, straight meander lines—can be reconfigured into four states. The proposed metasurface becomes a reflector with emptied channels, whereas it exhibits linear-to-circular polarization conversion (or linear-to-cross-polarization conversion) properties when the top (or bottom) layer is filled with a liquid metal alloy. Upon normal excitation of linearly u/v-polarized waves and activation of the bottom layer, the metasurface reflects cross v/u-polarized waves in the frequencies from 9.83 to 17.42 GHz (53% bandwidth) with a polarization conversion ratio (PCR) of at least 90%. On the other hand, the metasurface operates as a linear-to-circular polarizer (for u/v-polarized waves) over 8.97–11.30 GHz (23% bandwidth), reflecting left- or right-hand circularly polarized waves. To verify the polarization conversion performance, a  $25\times 25$  element metasurface array is fabricated and measured.

The method takes advantage of the ability of full-wave commercial simulators to deal with finite structures having anisotropic media. In particular, the proposed method extends the possibilities of commercial eigenmode solvers in the following ways: 1) anisotropic materials with nondiagonal permittivity and permeability tensors can be analyzed; 2) the attenuation constant can easily be computed in both propagating and stopband regions, and lossy materials can be included in the simulation; and 3) unbounded and radiating structures, such as leaky-wave antennas (LWAs), can be treated. The latter feature may be considered the most remarkable since the structures must be forcefully bounded with electric/magnetic walls in the eigensolvers of most commercial simulators. In this work, the proposed method is particularized for the study of liquid crystals (LCs) in microwave and antenna devices. Thus, the dispersion properties of a great variety of LC-based configurations are analyzed, from canonical structures, such as waveguide and microstrip, to complex reconfigurable phase shifters in ridge gap-waveguide technology and LWAs.

The branches of this structure are modeled as conductor-backed coplanar waveguide segments with integrated series capacitors, while the node region is modeled as a grid of microstrip (MS) lines with suitably augmented propagation velocities. The dispersion properties of the canonical UC-EBG unit cell are simulated in Ansys HFSS and compared with those of an equivalent simulation model based on a 2-D arrangement of weakly loaded MTM-EBGs, as well as similar data produced by the MTL equivalent-circuit model, which are all found to be in agreement. It is then shown that additional capacitive loading allows for substantial miniaturization, a regime in which even better agreement is produced between the equivalent circuit model’s dispersion data and the data produced by an equivalent HFSS model. Using these data, the Bloch modes of this structure are analyzed in detail.

By extending the length of vias and folding the shape of the pattern on the top, the unit size of this proposed absorber is reduced greatly, while its absorption performance maintains. Furthermore, the adopted hybrid metal–graphene structure avoids loading multiple lumped elements, and the complexity and the cost of the fabrication are reduced by screen-printing technology. Because of the elements with miniaturized periodicity, the proposed absorber can shift the grating lobe (GL) out of the absorption band when illuminated by a large-angle oblique incident wave. A prototype absorber is fabricated and measured. The period of the proposed absorber is about  $0.045\lambda _{L}$  at the lowest operating frequency.

Thereby, the problem of achieving the scattering profile is recast into finding the ground-state solution of the associated Ising Hamiltonian. To rapidly explore the configuration states, we encode the Ising coefficients with quantum annealing (QA) algorithms, taking advantage of the fact that the adiabatic evolution efficiently performs energy minimization in the Ising model. Finally, the optimization problem is solved on the D-Wave 2048-qubit quantum adiabatic optimizer machine for binary phase as well as quadriphase reflective MSs.

Instead, a rigorous formula is obtained for the computation of the surface current from the scattered electric field. Besides, the algorithm only contains convolution operations with the scalar Green’s function and second derivatives operations to iteratively update the surface currents and scattered electric field. Also, hypersingular integration arising from the singularities of the surface current and scattered electric field is properly regularized. Furthermore, the algorithm converges fast and satisfactory results are obtained after a few iterations, and it is about ten times as fast as the MoM.

The traditional one-region formation with the approximation of perfectly electric conductors (PECs) or surface impedances may not be valid anymore, and two-region integral equation formations are needed in the integral equation approach. Also, the electric field integral equation (EFIE) tends to break down at low frequencies, and augmented electric field integral equation (AEFIE) has been proposed to remedy the problem. In this work, we treat lossy conductors as penetrable objects and propose two-region augmented hybrid field integral equations (AHFIEs) for low-frequency analysis. The HFIEs consist of the EFIE of describing the exterior of a conductor and the magnetic field integral equation (MFIE) of describing its interior. Since the magnetic current density appears in the  ${\mathcal{ L}}$  operator in the HFIEs, we select the magnetic charge density as a new unknown function to be solved and introduce the continuity equation of magnetic current density as an extra equation. By incorporating the volume integral equations (VIEs) of describing the substrate with arbitrary penetrable media in the interconnect structures, the two-region augmented volume-surface integral equations (AVSIEs) are formulated for entire structures. The AVSIEs are solved by the method of moments (MoM) where the Rao–Wilton–Glisson (RWG) and Schaubert–Wilton–Glisson (SWG) basis functions are used to represent the surface current densities of AHFIEs and volume current densities of VIEs, respectively, while a pulse basis function is employed to represent the charge densities of AHFIEs. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the approach and good results have been obtained.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3118849","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671328,62071331); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573382","Augmented integral equations;lossy interconnect structures;low frequency;two-region formulations","Conductors;Integral equations;Current density;Mathematical models;Substrates;Method of moments;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","","4","","42","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new digital maps, referred to as RADIO maps are defined as RADIOS and RADIOS2 maps. The RADIOS maps, which are world maps of refractivity gradients and atmospheric ducts, are obtained from data collected at radiosonde stations at 892 sites. The RADIOS2 map, which is a world map of the wet term of surface refractivity, is obtained from data collected at radiosonde and surface stations at 3218 sites. To test the consistency between RADIO maps and ITU-R ERAI (International Telecommunication Union Recommendations employing ERA-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis-interim) reanalysis data for 36 years from 1979 to 2014) maps; a comparison is performed with the cumulative distributions of refractivity gradients at two radiosonde stations. The accuracy of RADIO maps is checked through comparisons with the maximum, mean, and standard deviation of the relative errors, which are obtained from observed values and predicted values, between RADIO maps and ITU-R ERAI maps. Our results show that: 1) RADIOS2 map is consistent with the current ITU-R ERAI map with respect to the wet term of surface refractivity; 2)  $\Delta N_{65\,\mathrm {m}}$ (50) and  $\beta $  obtained from RADIOS maps are larger than those obtained from ITU-R ERAI maps in low-latitude coastal and marine areas; and 3) comparisons between RADIOS and ITU-R radios_duct maps (i.e., the world digital maps obtained from a 20-year (1977–1996) dataset of 661 radiosonde stations released by ITU-R P.453-14) show that ITU-R radios_duct maps predict lower occurrences of surface and elevated ducts at low latitudes.

The proposed method lifts the conventional bandwidth limitation enforced by the performance of a single PCM and expands the RCS reduction bandwidth. A systematic strategy for ultrabroadband RCS reduction design is developed and an effective reflection coefficient amplitude of the composite surface ( $\Gamma _{ {eff}}$ ) is derived as a new RCS reduction indicator. Based on this indicator, complete polarization conversion (CPC) frequency points of PCM are identified as important characteristics, and PCM pairs with interleaved CPC points, termed as initial PCM (I-PCM) and complementary PCM (C-PCM), are designed to compensate each other for ultrabroadband RCS reduction. A scaling-and-tuning two-step method for designing the C-PCM of a specific I-PCM is developed and validated. To further improve RCS reduction performance, taking the  ${\Gamma _{ {eff}}}$  as an indicator, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to select the optimal I-PCMs, C-PCMs, and their area ratios. Finally, an ultrabroadband RCS reduction surface is designed, fabricated, measured, and validated. It realizes 10-dB monostatic RCS reduction ranging from 7.6 to 26.2 GHz (110.7% relative bandwidth) which exceeds the polarization conversion bandwidth of each individual PCM.

Radiated waves from the antenna with different propagation directions interfere in space. Regions of enhanced waves are formed when the interference is predominantly constructive at the observing point. The coherently enhanced wave propagates at the group velocity. If the antenna is perpendicular to the background magnetic field, the regions of strong waves form two back-to-back Fresnel zones that are parabolic-shaped cones along the background magnetic field from the antenna. The power within each cone drops with distance at a rate of  $1/r$  much more slowly than the  $1/r^{2}$  thinning of a spherical wave as in vacuum. The total radiation can be approximately derived by the total energy flux integrated over the Fresnel zone. The derived radiation resistance is much greater than that in vacuum. It is proportional to frequency as  $1/f^{2}$  and proportional to the antenna length as  $d^{2}$ . To radiate more power, a longer antenna is preferred, a result that is opposite to some previous theoretical studies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3121144","U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA9453-18-C-0056); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9585627","Dipole antenna in magnetized plasma;electromagnetic wave propagation in plasma;Fresnel zone;radiation resistance;whistler wave transmission","Resistance;Antennas;Plasmas;Dipole antennas;Transmitting antennas;Magnetic fields;Antenna theory","","7","","28","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents a real-time, fully automatic algorithm for the wideband millimeter-wave (mm-wave) radar reconstruction of the nominal human body contours, even in the presence of an affixed weak dielectric object or when a portion of the body cross section is not captured by the imaging scanner. The algorithm extracts the main contours from a noisy collection of 3-D reconstructed reflectivity and approximates the nominal human body cross section via fitting a low-order angular Fourier series. This important step is essential for precise characterization of concealed body-worn explosives. A ranking algorithm is developed as a metric for the nominal body reconstruction accuracy. We verify the developed algorithm by applying it to the actual images of the high definition–advanced imaging technology (HD-AIT) system, a laboratory prototype mm-wave scanning system developed recently by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The measured results show that the right-handed CP (RHCP) scanning range of the incident beam is −31° to −8° and 5° to −14°, and the left-handed CP (LHCP) scanning range of the corresponding reflected beam is 31°–6° and −6° to −15°.

The implemented antenna can be excited by two different RF signals, at 450 and 1500 MHz, with a controllable power level between 1 and 50 W to adjust the effective length of the antenna. The proposed configuration allows both communication and excitation waves to be applied to a single coupling sleeve on the plasma column using a diplexer.

First, a polarization-rotation transmitarray is designed based on a new Fabry–Perot (FP)-liked phasing element. Unlike its counterparts, this new FP-liked phasing element twists the polarization of electromagnetic (EM) waves and provides sufficient phase tuning range only in the operating band of FTA. In the meantime, in the band of FRA, the transmitarray acts as the polarizing grid, which reflects one polarization while allowing the orthogonally polarized one to pass without affecting its polarization and phase. Second, a polarization-rotation-ground-integrated (PRGI) reflectarray is designed. The reflectarray collimates the EM wave in the band of FRA and twists its polarization by 90°, forming the folded reflectarray. Meanwhile, it also twists the polarization of the EM wave in the band of FTA. By hybridizing the FTA and FRA sharing the same aperture, the proposed design achieves dual-band high-gain radiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the FRA and FTA are combined to form a shared aperture antenna, which inherits the advantages of both FRA and FTA, such as high gain, low profile, and reduced blockage effect of the feed.

Some in-body applications demand high data rates, so ultrawideband (UWB) spectrum has been proposed as a good candidate because of its large bandwidth available. Besides, breathing can lead to internal movement of the torso and consequently, of devices installed in this area. Thus, the radio channel performance can be affected by such movement leading to a malfunction of the radio interface of the medical device. This work aims at analyzing the effect of breathing on the propagation channel by means of in vivo measurements in living animal models. Continuous wave (CW) measurements have been carried out for five different frequencies in the lower part of the UWB band, and the effects of breathing on the relative received power (module and phase) are analyzed and discussed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3118724","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación(grant numbers:RTI2018-099880-B-C31); Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Innovación y Transferencia de la Universitat Politècnica de València through the Colorrectal Diagnosis of Tumours Based on EM Properties (COLODEM) (First Research Projects)(grant numbers:PAID-06-18); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573508","Antenna;breathing;implant communications;in-body;in vivo;path loss;ultrawideband (UWB);wireless medical devices","Antenna measurements;Antennas;Frequency measurement;Animals;In vivo;Implants;Wireless communication","","2","","29","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We categorize the focusing problem into the frequency focusing for wideband systems and the range focusing for narrowband systems. In an out-of-focus wideband system, a shifted shadow of the object is present in the reconstruction, whereas for a range out of the focused system, the recovered images are blurred. To overcome these issues, first, we theoretically show that the defocusing variations for both categories are bounded. Then, we present a universal formulation for focusing problem, which covers both wideband and narrowband systems. As the true focused images are sharp at the boundaries of the objects, our strategy for solving the problem is to maximize a defined sharpness metric. Moreover, we propose an autofocusing zero-knowledge algorithm, which concerns with maximizing the sharpness metric from an unknown object, while the exact gradient of the cost function is unknown. The proposed method is suitable for practical applications since it is simple, fast, and computationally efficient. The simulation results on synthetic and measured data are promising and support our claims that the proposed method increases the quality of the reconstruction.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3119100","Iran National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576617","Coherent points;gradient approximation;millimeter-wave (MMW) imaging;range focusing;wideband focusing","Imaging;Focusing;Wideband;Measurement;Mathematical models;Image reconstruction;Transceivers","","4","","16","IEEE","15 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The update equation (57) proposed in [1] instead enforces a weaker interpolation condition at the interface between a coarse and a fine finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) grid, as discussed in this correction. It can be shown that this weaker condition is sufficient to ensure dissipativity of the system and that the update equations described in the original publication [1] give rise to a stable subgridding algorithm. The only equations of [1] affected by this correction are (43a)–(43c), (61a)–(61c), (67), and (68). Also, the proofs in (47)–(49), (69), and (70) need to be updated accordingly, but the conclusion remains unchanged.
