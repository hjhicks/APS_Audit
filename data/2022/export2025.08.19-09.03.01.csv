Passive electrically small antennas (ESAs) have low bandwidth and poor efficiency values, which makes them challenging to radiate instantaneously broadband, high-power signals for applications such as electronic warfare. To address these challenges, we present the design and experimental demonstration of an active ESA capable of transmission over the entire HF band. The proposed antenna consists of a 2-m long dipole integrated with a class-AB push–pull amplifier. The amplifier circuit that drives the antenna is specifically designed to behave as a high-voltage current buffer to the antenna, resulting in ultra-wideband operation. The amplifier uses high-power vertically diffused MOSFET transistors capable of sustaining the high voltage and current swings that occur at the terminals of the highly reactive dipole during transmission. A prototype of the antenna is fabricated and characterized in field tests. Experiments demonstrate stable, ultra-wideband operation over the entire HF band. Measurement results show that the proposed active antenna can offer total efficiency improvements of over 15 dB compared to a passive matching scenario. The advantages of this approach over non-Foster impedance matching techniques are also highlighted.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3119095","Office of Naval Research (ONR)(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2207,N00014-16-1-2098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576607","Dipole antennas;electrically small antennas (ESAs);transmitting antennas;ultra-wideband antennas","Dipole antennas;Bandwidth;Transmitting antennas;Antennas;High-voltage techniques;Voltage;Capacitance","","10","","29","IEEE","15 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rather than using conventional method of radiation pattern and polarization diversities, this work demonstrates that by taking advantage of a proper superposition of some even/odd modes, it is able to generate similar radiation pattern and polarization no matter which port is excited. It is also found that port isolation and impedance matching are dependent on not only operating modes but also input couplings. The proposed CMs method consists of three main steps. First, adjust desired even and odd modes to be equal in resonant frequency (ResF). Second, suppress unwanted modes without affecting desired ones. Lastly, determine feeding positions to obtain proper input couplings. In this way, satisfactory port isolation and impedance matching could be achieved simultaneously and quickly, getting rid of complicated decoupling structures and time-consuming optimization. To exemplify how the proposed CMs method works, two MIMO antennas are successfully designed by just using simple slots and shorting pins.

With the integrated design of VP and HP elements, the proposed antenna shows a much more compact size compared to existing schemes. To enhance the bandwidth of low-profile VP radiation, a slot is etched on the cavity to create a new mode for dual-resonance response, realizing a wide bandwidth of 24.5–29.5 GHz for both polarizations. In addition, radiation pattern modification techniques are employed to achieve good endfire beams with a high front-to-back ratio for both polarizations, thus enabling a high peak gain of 10.3 and 11.3 dBi for VP and HP, respectively. A wide beam scanning range of ±50° with realized gain above 7 dBi is realized at 27 GHz for both polarizations.

However, the majority of the research on it focuses on adding supplementary structures to produce more resonant modes to achieve more functions. Here, we focus on the inherent modes of the dipole itself. Dipole antenna has alternating odd and even modes. In classical antenna theory, only odd modes are excited. The even modes are difficult to be excited due to their very high input impedances. In this article, both odd and even modes of the dipole antenna are excited simultaneously by a single port with a novel feeding structure. Moreover, to tune the resonant frequencies of such multiple modes, a method by combining antithetical structures of indentations and outdentations is proposed. Its principle is explained intuitively by eigencurrent distribution. By these new techniques, all the first six modes of a dipole are excited, among which five modes are used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The antenna can cover industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands of 868 and 2450 MHz, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) band of 1575 MHz, and 5G bands of 3500 and 4900 MHz.

The proposed dual-band antenna consists of a low-band (LB) and high-band (HB) antenna elements. The HB element is coaxially located under the radiator of the LB element, minimizing the overall size. The proposed LB element consists of a two-layer-FSS-based radiator (FSS-radiator) and two pairs of differential feeding probes. Besides, the passband of the proposed FSS-radiator is designed to cover the operating band of the HB element. As a result, the radiation of the HB element can transmit through the FSS-radiator of the LB element. Without reducing HB element gain, instead, the average HB element gain can be improved more than 1 dB by the feeding probes of the LB element. For demonstration, a prototype of the dual-band antenna operating in the LB of 2.3–2.7 GHz and the HB of 3.3–3.8 GHz is fabricated and measured. The dual-band prototype features high gain (~9.1 dBi in the LB and ~8.6 dBi in the HB) in a compact radiation aperture of  $0.32\lambda _{lc} \times 0.32\lambda _{lc}$  or  $0.45\lambda _{hc} \times 0.45\lambda _{hc}$  (where  $\lambda _{lc}$  and  $\lambda _{hc}$ , respectively, denote the guided wavelengths at the central operating frequencies in LB and HB).

However, a single TM cylindrical leaky wave is known to be incapable of radiating a directive broadside beam. To solve the conundrum, a generalized pencil-of-function analysis of the exciting field is performed. It is found that a nonnegligible TE component is present, which exhibits a radial decay different from the TM component but the same complex radial wavenumber. Based on the geometrical symmetries of the structure, an electromagnetic model for the surface currents excited on the annular microstrips is developed and validated by full-wave results for both the currents and the associated radiation patterns.

The system is completely passive and suitable for millimeter-wave applications, including some in defense, where both discrete beam steering and continuous beam steering in two dimensions (elevation and azimuth) are required at a reasonably fast speed. The beam-steering capability is achieved using a pair of distinct low-profile and planar phase transformers (PPTs) placed in the near-field region of a fixed-beam radiating source. The antenna system demonstrates a steering and impedance-matching bandwidth of 28.6%, from 30 to 40 GHz. A prototype of the new antenna system, including a pair of thin PPTs and a completely automated mechanical system to rotate each of the PPTs around the antenna axis, has been fabricated and tested. The pair of rotating PPTs, equivalent to a pair of 3-D dielectric PTs (DPTs), introduces a precalculated phase gradient to the input near field from the fixed-beam antenna and creates an output near field that will radiate toward a selected direction, which can be varied within a large conical region with a maximum apex angle of 108°. The system exhibits the predicted and measured peak gains of 21.5 and 21.7 dBi, respectively, and the measured gain variation over 2-D beam steering is less than 2.2 dB.

We analyze the radiation of three kinds of half-wavelength dipoles (strip, U-shaped strip, and folded strip). It is found that these three diploes produce omnidirectional radiation patterns when they work on half-wavelength mode. In the proposed design, we make these three dipoles couple with each other to achieve wide bandwidth. In addition, both electric coupling and magnetic coupling are observed at the lower band and the upper band, respectively. Therefore, two radiation nulls can be achieved without any extra circuit, which makes the proposed antenna filtering property and compact. A prototype is fabricated and measured to verify our idea. The results show that the proposed antenna has a 10 dB bandwidth of 42.51%, an in-band gain of ~2.4 dBi, and an out-of-band radiation suppression of more than 10 dB with a total size of  ${0.4}{ {\lambda }}_{{0}}\,\,{\times }\,\, 0.06{ {\lambda }}_{{0}}$ .

The proposed antenna consists of a main radiating element, a metallic wall, a ground plane, and a single-layer partially reflective surface (PRS). To improve the UBS performance, a single radiating element is designed such that it provides a tilted beam with good radiation performance over the scanning angles. The metallic wall is used close to the radiating element as a reflector to suppress the propagation in undesired directions. A general design guide is given by a theoretical analysis of the FPC structures using the ray-tracing method to formulate the beam-steering functionality versus frequency over desired predetermined angles. The PRS layer is designed without any tuning elements to provide the beam scanning over the angles of  $10^\circ < \theta < 45 ^\circ $  and the frequency range of 24–30 GHz. The proposed Fabry–Perot cavity antenna (FPCA) structure is fabricated and the measurement results show a beam steering from 19° to 54° over the frequency band from 24 to 30 GHz, which is in good agreement with the calculated results from the theoretical analysis.

Second, the mm-wave SIDRA is a 3-D-type device, and in the case of coplanar integration, its height can be freely adapted to the thickness of 3.5 GHz antenna without concerning the impact from surface waves as many 2-D-type antennas have to do.

In this way, enhanced gain is successfully attained in broadside at the desired frequency. To theoretically investigate such an attractive property, an equivalent circuit model is first established to illustrate that the working frequency as well as the phase and leakage constants can be independently controlled by altering the shunt inductance and resistance, and further properly adjusting their quantities. Then, a row of shorting pins is appropriately loaded at one side of the MSL, so as to realize the inductive-loaded periodical leaky-wave structure for broadside radiation. After that, a more effective and practical transmission line model is derived to fully investigate the side pin-loaded MSL. Based on this transmission line model, an efficient method is proposed to design the working frequency and the values of  $\beta /k_{0}$  and  $\alpha /k_{0}$  in a controllable way. Furthermore, a gain enhancement of such an LWA is carried out with resorting to the directivity and radiation efficiency, aiming to acquire the maximum antenna gain. In final, the proposed EH0-mode LWA with broadside radiation is simulated, fabricated, and measured.

To address this challenge, a two-channel rectenna with an asymmetrical coupler feeding network (ACFN) has been proposed for WIPT under the power-splitting and time-sharing (PS and TS) schemes. The proposed two-port rectenna consists of a receiving antenna integrated with ACFN where one output port is connected to a rectifying circuit, whereas the other is used for information recovery. Different from the conventional PS scheme with equal division, the proposed rectenna can adjust ratios of power at two outputs. That is, routing high power to the radio frequency (RF)-dc port, and transferring low power but of a sufficient signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) to the port being used for signal demodulation/decoding. As a result, the simulated/measured maximum RF-dc conversion efficiency of the rectenna can reach up to 73.9%/70.4% for quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulated signals and 63.9%/60.7% for continuous wave (CW) signals.

First, a uniform-aperture structure is presented and its limitations on forming the beam are studied. Then, a sinusoidal curve is employed to modify the geometry of guided-wave structure which divides the slot into a number of segments, making a periodic aperture. After that, a method is proposed to regulate the guided waves inside the ESIW. To this end, a modulation function is derived to simultaneously determine the local amplitude and segment length of the physical sinusoidal curve at each individual points on the structure. This results in manipulating the phase constant  $(\beta)$  and leakage rate  $(\alpha)$  across the aperture which ultimately controls both the tilt angle and sidelobe-level (SLL) of the constructed beam.

This is enabled by synergizing dynamic phases and local geometric phases within 0° and 90° rotations. As a consequence, similar focusing behavior is expected when it is illuminated by a plane wave of arbitrary polarization since any incoming wave is a superposition of  $\sigma +$  and  $\sigma -$  wave. Such an intriguing feature can be utilized to engineer a polarization-insensitive reflectarray/transmitarray in a shared aperture by placing a feeding source of different polarizations at its focal spot without altering the array aperture. Therein, the polarization of the meta-array is determined by its feeding which is readily to be changed in practice. For demonstration and possible applications, two reflectarrays composed of  $50\times50$  elements at Ku band with one in normal and the other in offset configuration were designed and experimentally characterized. Numerical and experimental results illustrate that both reflectarrays are able to work in Dual linear polarization (LP) and Dual CP states by utilizing LP and CP horns of different orientations.

To obtain insights into how the angular and spectral bandwidth of meta-atoms relate to the metasurface focusing performance, point dipole models are used which incorporate different aspects of the meta-atoms’ angular response. It is emphasized that despite the meta-atoms being designed under the assumption that they support a single dipolar resonance, other resonances exist within the meta-atom geometry and become stronger at oblique incidence. These resonances disturb the designed phase and amplitude responses, resulting in lower focusing efficiency at higher incident angles. The modeling of higher order modes leads to good agreement with the experimental measurements, confirming that angular dispersion of the meta-atoms is the dominant mechanism in determining off-axis aberrations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3118848","Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP)(grant numbers:PRJ-1081/LPDP.3/2017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573479","Angular dispersion;focusing efficiency;metasurface;oblique incidence","Metasurfaces;Focusing;Dispersion;Degradation;Bandwidth;Antenna measurements;Surface impedance","","4","","48","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, we performed wider band measurements using GPS E5a (≈10 Mcps—chips per second— > 20 MHz bandwidth) and obtained estimations of power delay profiles. Due to lack of dynamic range and delay resolution, in these measurements, no conclusive information was gathered on the time spreading caused by the channel. What was clear is that the time spreading was not significant outside the first signal chip, i.e.,  $\approx 0.1~\mu \text{s}$ . Still wideband modeling is required within this spreading range. Now, we want to extend the model to the wideband case. To achieve this goal, we have used a rough surface scattering model applicable to sea surfaces and employed it to characterize the time dispersion to be expected.

To this end, two extra steps will be performed prior to the inverse scattering step. First, an inverse source algorithm inverts the desired far-field performance criteria to infer a set of equivalent surface currents on a boundary close to the design domain. These equivalent currents are then converted to a set of field values that constitute the required aperture fields. Second, these aperture fields are scaled such that the input incident power to the design domain is approximately equal to the output power leaving the design domain. Finally, the desired scattered fields are formed and then inverted by an inverse scattering algorithm to reconstruct a lossless reflectionless dielectric profile within the design domain.

Perhaps the most important reason is a high cost of full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis of antenna systems. Although imperative in ensuring evaluation reliability, it entails considerable computational expenses. These are especially pronounced when carrying out EM-driven design tasks such as geometry parameter tuning or uncertainty quantification, both requiring repetitive simulations. Conducting some of the design procedures, e.g., global search or yield optimization, directly at the level of simulation models may be prohibitive. The use of fast replacement models (or surrogates) may alleviate these difficulties; yet, accurate modeling of antenna structures faces its own challenges. The two major obstacles are the curse of dimensionality, manifesting itself in a rapid growth of the number of training data samples necessary to render a reliable model (as a function of the number of antenna parameters) and high nonlinearity of antenna characteristics. Recently, the concept of performance-driven modeling has been introduced, where the modeling process is focused on a small region of the parameters’ space, which contains high-quality designs with respect to the considered performance figures. The most advanced variation in this class of methods is nested kriging, where both the model domain and the surrogate itself are constructed through kriging interpolation. Domain confinement is realized using a set of preoptimized reference designs and allows for significant improvement of the model predictive power while using a limited number of training data samples. In this work, the constrained modeling concept is coupled with a novel pyramidal deep regression network (PDRN) surrogate, which offers improved handling of highly nonlinear antenna responses. Three examples of microstrip antennas are used to demonstrate the advantages of constrained PDRN metamodels over the nested kriging surrogates with the (average) accuracy improved by a factor of 2 without increasing the training dataset cardinality.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111299","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:217771); Narodowe Centrum Nauki(grant numbers:2018/31/B/ST7/02369); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538974","Antenna design;deep neural networks (DNNs);domain confinement;nested kriging;surrogate modeling","Antennas;Data models;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Optimization;Deep learning;Training data","","56","","115","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During the last years, unauthorized access has become an issue, as it has been proven on numerous unpleasant occasions. A typical theft scheme is based on approaching a victim with a card reader. However, a straightforward adaptation of the reader’s antenna elements allows performing the attack from a distance, opening a severe security loophole. Here, we propose and demonstrate hardware-based protection capable of preventing a far-field attack of this kind. Our solution is based on an RFID chip shielding with an opaque metal. The Faraday type of the enclosure has a small aperture, which suppresses electromagnetic field leakage from the device. This property affects both up and down interrogation links, virtually making the far-field attack impossible. Activation of the card is done by holding it in hand–this way, it is made accessible to an authorized readout, which still remains wireless. The physical principle of the operation is placing a high-index dielectric structure next to a subwavelength aperture, making it electromagnetically larger and, as a result, supporting the field leakage. Our experimental prototype, validated by several different users, shows the capability to diminish far-field attacks on ultrahigh frequency (UHF) RFID tags. This hardware security solution can find usage in numerous applications, such as biometric passports, credit cards, and many others, where unauthorized access to sensitive data is highly undesirable.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3118846","Russian Science Foundation(grant numbers:19-79-10232); Russian Science Foundation for Basic Research, Sirius University of Science and Technology, JSC Russian Railways and Educational Fund “Talent and success”(grant numbers:20-37-51011); ERC StG “In Motion”(grant numbers:802279); PAZY Foundation; Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology through the Project “Integrated 2D and 3D Functional Printing of Batteries With Metamaterials and Antennas; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573359","Electromagnetic shielding;radio frequency identification (RFID);wireless security","Apertures;Dielectrics;Antennas;Security;Metals;Wireless communication;Uplink","","18","","22","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The vertical height of the spike is typically  $\lambda $ /4 and a further investigation demonstrates shortening of its effective height by folding the same by 90°. A set of prototypes has been experimentally studied to ensure the predicted characteristics viz. the 12 dB consistent suppression of XP level over the whole range of elevation in H-plane and an average of 5–7 dB suppression in backside radiation. These achievements are also associated with more than 1 dB improvement in peak gain. The design is straightforward, low cost, and commercially viable.

It is demonstrated that leakage of the topological edge mode is capable of both frequency and bias scanning to generate a steerable beam across the broadside direction. Moreover, the mechanism behind the immunity of PTIs to defects is also investigated in detail. Although topological edge waves can bypass PEC-slab defects ideally, the phase change along the defect affects the radiation pattern. The switch between sum-difference beams by tuning the scale of the PEC-slab is direct evidence to verify our analysis.

The proposed strategy is shown to offer an improved accuracy/efficiency trade-off in the computed radar cross section.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538987","A posteriori error estimation;adaptive h-refinement;edge singularity;electric field integral equation (EFIE);Rao–Wilton–Glisson (RWG) basis function","Indexes;Integral equations;History;Standards;Radar cross-sections;Electric potential;Surface waves","","7","","14","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Modeling such structures in the finite-element method can require a very dense mesh near the structures, which increases the computation cost and degrades the mesh quality. In this work, the surface current boundary condition is incorporated into the framework of the spectral-element spectral-integral method to efficiently model thin structures with double periodicity embedded in layered media. The thin structures are viewed as zero-thickness surfaces, and no dense mesh is required. Furthermore, a fast and convenient formulation is developed to evaluate the tangential field in the background of doubly periodic structures. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method by comparing with various reference solvers.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3112542","NSFC(grant numbers:92066105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9541013","Doubly periodic structure;finite-element boundary-integral method;layered media;spectral-element spectral-integral (SESI) method;surface current boundary condition (SCBC);thin material surface","Surface impedance;Boundary conditions;Numerical analysis;Periodic structures;Integral equations;Costs;Surface waves","","5","","22","IEEE","20 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The impact of a monolithic, thin-wall radome on antenna performance in the thermal, mechanical, and electromagnetic domains is considered. The structure must thermally handle high continuous wave power as well as mechanically withstand the impact of pressurization while preserving the electrical performance of a radome-less configuration. A simple test set for measuring radome deflection under high pressure is also discussed. Studies with available materials are conducted, and it is found that the  $76~\mu \text{m}$  thick Teflon coated fiberglass has the best performance balance in all domains. Other nonporous materials with comparable electrical and mechanical parameters will have similar behavior.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111664","Naval Research Laboratory through a contract with Leidos, Inc; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9540349","Horn antenna;millimeter wave (mmW);radome","Radomes;Gain;Temperature measurement;Antenna measurements;Horn antennas;Temperature distribution;Permittivity","","4","","30","IEEE","16 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
