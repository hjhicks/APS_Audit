The near field in this solid angle can be efficiently evaluated through the integration of the spectral Green’s function along the steepest descent path (SDP). Beyond this solid angle, defined as the shadow boundary angle, a residual contribution due to the leaky-wave pole must also be added to fully describe the near field. It is found that this shadow boundary angle can be used to define the phase center and geometry of a truncated lens that couples well to leaky-wave antennas, even in electrically small-to-medium sized lenses and low-contrast cases. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed study, we combine the SDP field calculation with a Fourier optics (FO) methodology to evaluate the aperture efficiency and radiation patterns of small-to-medium sized lenses in reception. A truncated silicon lens with a diameter of only four free-space wavelengths is presented with almost 80% aperture efficiency. Excellent agreement with full-wave simulations is achieved, which demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed design and analysis methodology.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137238","European Research Council (ERC) Starting(grant numbers:LAA-THz-CC (639749)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664436","Leaky-wave antennas;lens antennas;near fields;phase center;spherical wave","Lenses;Geometry;Solids;Leaky wave antennas;Bandwidth;Silicon;Electric fields","","6","","38","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike the traditional method of adopting frequency selective surfaces to achieve filtering characteristic, the proposed strategy focuses on the feeding source. We can obtain an excellent filtering response by utilizing a performance-improved filtering antenna to act as the source of the FPC antenna. To validate the concept, we first propose a new substrate-integrated-waveguide-fed (SIW-fed) filtering antenna element working in a 60-GHz band. By using the slotted radiating patches, two radiation nulls are first generated, respectively, on each side of the operating band. We then design a stepped-impedance waveguide feeding structure and a pair of U-shaped hairpin lines to introduce another two radiation nulls to improve the suppression level in the stopband. The proposed filtering antenna prototype shows a −10-dB impedance bandwidth of 57.5–66.6 GHz as well as a maximum gain of 7.9 dBi. Based on such feeding sources, an FPC antenna is developed and validated. It achieves a 3-dB gain bandwidth from 58 to 65.6 GHz, a peak gain of 15.8 dBi, and a suppression level of over 24 dB.

Several double-sided slots acting as radiation elements are notched on the waveguide to produce an endfire pattern. To overcome the restriction associated with the endfire radiation condition of a linear array, a metallic core periodically loaded with pins is used to control the dispersion of the proposed double-sided-slot waveguide. By optimizing the height distribution of the loading pins along the longitudinal direction using a cosine function, stable endfire radiation can be achieved over a broad operating band. Moreover, dual-polarized radiation can be automatically implemented because of the rotational symmetry of the proposed LWA. Furthermore, two rectangular waveguides connected with a square waveguide are used as the orthomode transducer (OMT) of the proposed LWA. The numerical and experimental results verify that dual-polarized endfire radiation is achieved in the frequency range of 7.6–9.1 GHz with an isolation of higher than 45 dB.

Instead of using even-numbered linearly polarized (LP) modes with quadrature phase, three orthogonal LP modes are used for CP bandwidth enhancement, where the middle mode is shared by two cross-polarized modes with the same polarization. The advantages include reduced constraints, lower complexity, and a higher degree of freedom for antenna design. Guided by the method, a U-slot antenna and an E-shaped antenna are proposed and designed with characteristic mode analysis (CMA). Both antennas work with a TM10-like mode and a TM01-like mode. Differently, the U-slot antenna works with an additional slot mode and the E-shaped antenna works with an additional TM11-like mode. The operating modes are manipulated by the slot loadings for creating phase difference. As a result, wideband CP radiation is achieved with a single feeding. CMA-based empirical formulas are derived for fast design. The proposed method and antennas are experimentally validated.

The ILA has often large height and suffers from significant scan loss. In this article, we demonstrate a low-profile, efficient, and scanloss-reduced integrated metal-lens antenna (IMLA). An IMLA is a combination of a dielectric lens and metal–plate lens. A 16- $\lambda _{0}$  diameter IMLA is designed using the HDPE and 58 stainless steel plates to achieve the  $f/d$  of 0.69. The simulated aperture and radiation efficiency of the IMLA are 73% and 92%, respectively. At 76 GHz, the simulated and measured realized gains of the fabricated IMLA are 31.24 and 31 dBi, respectively. The IMLA is designed to steer the main beam to ±30°. The scan loss is reduced by tilting the radiation pattern of the feeds at offset positions along the focal plane. The radiation pattern of the square waveguide feed is tilted using asymmetrical dielectric pins. The asymmetrical dielectric pins reduce the simulated gain scan loss of the IMLA by more than 1.5 dB at 30° steering angle. The simulation results show that the inclination of the feed radiation pattern helps limit the scan loss of the IMLA to 4.1 and 4.3 dB in the H- and E-planes for 30° steering angle, respectively. The measured scan loss of the manufactured IMLA is 3.8 and 6.2 dB in the H- and E-plane, respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111192","Business Finland through the 5WAVE Project; Academy of Finland through the ADENN Project; Nokia Foundation; Walter Ahlström Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538997","Antenna;beam switching;beam tilt;dielectric lens antenna;high gain antenna;low-profile lens;matching layers;metal–plate lens;millimeter-wave frequencies;scan loss reduction","Lenses;Feeds;Permittivity;Antenna radiation patterns;Pins;Dielectric losses;Gain","","13","","28","CCBY","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The formulation is based on the derivation of a new form of nonlinear integral equation representing the equalization of all the optical ray-path lengths, denoted as regularized ray congruence (RRC) equation, and on its closed-form solution. An analytical form of aperture efficiency is given for standard feed patterns. The application of the formulas presented here allows for an instantaneous design for medium/high gain antennas with controllable total aperture efficiency till 80%. The accuracy of the formulation is tested by a full-wave analysis and compared with other formulations available in the literature. We found that the new formulation proposed here significantly reduces the phase error in a wide range of the lens parameters, thus allowing for a more efficient, accurate, and flexible design for GRIN lenses.

While many continuous leaky-wave antennas use subwavelength strips or other comparably small elements, in this work, the surface impedance is discretized very coarsely using only three square patches per period. With this architecture, a wide range of surface reactance can be achieved while maintaining a minimum feature size of the metallic pattern that is feasible for printed circuit fabrication. Another advantage of this approach over existing works in the mm-wave frequency range is that it allows precise engineering of the aperture illumination. We demonstrate this by applying amplitude tapering for sidelobe suppression. A comprehensive experimental study is presented, including near- and far-field measurements.

The proposed AFSA can absorb the cross-polarized wave and make the co-polarized wave pass through. The in-band co-polarized scattering beams can be tuned continuously with stable radiation beams by changing the capacitance of the varactor diodes. Therefore, the proposed device can reduce the RCS for in-band co- and cross-polarized incident waves. Moreover, taking advantage of the path difference between the radiating and scattering waves, the gain enhancement and RCS reduction (RCSR) are realized simultaneously. Simulated results show that the scattering beam can be tuned dynamically from –40° to 40° with a maximum gain enhancement of 7.2 dB. The co-polarized in-band reconfigurable scattering beam and the stable gain enhancement are first implemented in a single antenna.

The simulated characteristic mode analysis results show that this element can realize good CP at three independently adjustable frequencies (2.4, 3.8, and 5.8 GHz). By combining these three frequencies, a UWB CP antenna element is realized from 2.02 to 6.03 GHz for axial ratio (AR) less than 3.0 dB.

Closed-form formulations have been derived for quantifying the coupling impacts. The proposed formulations have been further verified with numerical examples and method of moment-based commercial solver, such as Antenna Toolbox. Later, the theory of substructure modes has been combined with the theory of coupled characteristic modes to understand the perturbation in coupling behavior in the presence of ground plane or a parasitic element.

The purpose of this approach is to achieve the dual-band transceiver regime in a compact array of magnetic antennas. Our work qualitatively develops the concept of the so-called high-impedance coil (HIC), combined with the adequate interfacing circuitry, which offers the decoupling of the HICs in the array due to the very high self-impedance compared to the mutual impedance. This concept has not been previously thought applicable to dual-band transceiver arrays. We show that, by slightly modifying only the cable shield, we achieve a dual-band transceiver high-impedance coil (dual-band TRHIC). The needed modification implies two asymmetric gaps granting two useful eigenmodes to the cable loop. The resonant excitation of these modes will allow the magnetic resonant scanning of both hydrogen and Phosphorus in the 7 T dc magnetic field. To verify our ideas, we simulated and measured a single TRHIC in both transmitting and receiving regimes and similarly studied two linear arrays made of two and three proposed TRHICs. The method of asymmetric gaps, in our opinion, allows one to engineer the targeted multifrequency operation of arrayed TRHICs decoupled at these frequencies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9539033","Decoupling of antennas;high-impedance coil (HIC);magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);shielded loop antennas;transceiver antenna","Antenna arrays;Magnetic resonance imaging;Impedance;Antennas;Resonant frequency;Transceivers;Dual band","","2","","17","CCBY","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Whereas dual-polarized FUSE arrays normally consist of offset radiator pairs conforming to the ubiquitous square-lattice egg-crate configuration and capacitively coupled at the ends to achieve ultra-wideband operational frequency ranges, this work is novel in that it uses conventional manufacturing to directly machine the dual-polarized FUSE array on a triangular lattice instead. Triangular lattices for dual-polarized wideband arrays are uncommon in the literature and have the benefit of 15.5% reduction in element counts over a square lattice aperture of the same footprint and upper frequency of operation, making this a useful development for applications requiring minimum element counts, i.e., reduced cost/weight.

The proposed array is miniaturized by bending the ground plane of the slot antenna. Suppression of cross-band mutual coupling and scattering is achieved by using the filtering performance of the slot antenna and a dual-function metasurface. The filtering performance of the slot antenna is realized using coupled microstrip lines inside the radiating slot and open-ended stubs on the feeding lines. The dual-function metasurface operates as an artificial magnetic conductor reflector in the LB and bandpass frequency-selective surface in the HB. By placing the dual-function metasurface behind the slot antenna, the radiation of the slot antenna is enhanced in the LB but not HB, and the negative effect of its HB scattering on the HB antennas is reduced. The working mechanism is explained in detail.

The curl–curl operator can hence be replaced by the Laplacian to find the divergence-free component of the field solution. The Laplacian is positive definite and well-conditioned. As a result, the convergence of an iterative solution of Maxwell’s equations can be guaranteed, and also significantly accelerated. Based on the finding, we represent the divergence-free component of the unknown field solution by deducting its curl-free component. The curl-free component resides in the nullspace of the curl–curl operator, which is also analytically known from the mesh information no matter it is a regular grid or an unstructured mesh. After the divergence-free component is rapidly solved from a Laplacian counterpart of the original system matrix, the curl-free component can also be solved from a Laplacian matrix, and hence having fast and guaranteed convergence. The total computational cost of the proposed method is simply a small number of sparse matrix-vector multiplications.

The underlying analysis and synthesis schemes are inspired by the rapidly growing research on metagratings (MGs), typically used to manipulate wave trajectories in free space. These sparse configurations of subwavelength polarizable particles (meta-atoms) are designed by careful tailoring of interelement near- and far-field interactions, relying on analytical models to resolve the required meta-atom distribution and geometry to facilitate a desired interference pattern when excited by the incident wave. Utilizing these MG design concepts, we develop a modal formalism for obtaining a collection of locations inside the bend junction, in which a passive scatterer may be placed to zero out the return loss. Subsequently, we propose two different shapes for the scatterer and discuss, for each of them, the ways in which their geometrical characteristics may be retrieved. This versatile and efficient methodology, verified via full-wave simulations, can be utilized to eliminate reflection loss in diverse bend configurations, often found in complex wave-guiding systems used for antenna feeding and power transmission.

First, an augmented Lagrangian method is introduced to transform a constrained objective function to be an unconstrained optimization. In addition, it is further decomposed into four quasi-linear subproblems. Second, we unfold the iterative scheme into a layer-wise deep neural network. Each subproblem is mapped into a module of the deep unrolling network. In PM-Net, these variables including the weight, the regularization of contrast, and other parameters are learned and updated alternately by corresponding network layers. PM-Net effectively combines neural networks with the knowledge of underlying physics as well as traditional techniques. Unlike existing networks, PM-Net explicitly exploits contrast source and contrast modules. Compared to traditional iterative methods, the performance of PM-Net is comparable or even better than subspace-based optimization method in the high noise-level circumstance. Compared to the state-of-the-art learning approaches, not only less network parameters need to be learned, but also better performance is achieved by PM-Net.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111281","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62161027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9539099","Deep learning;inverse scattering problems (ISPs);unrolling network","Deep learning;Permittivity;Training;Neural networks;Mathematical model;Inverse problems;Knowledge engineering","","22","","47","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, instead of describing the metasurface in terms of scattering coefficients that depend on the incidence direction, its scattering behavior is characterized by the surface susceptibility tensors that appear in the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs). As the latter quantities are constitutive parameters, they do not depend on the incident field and, thus, enable a more compact and physically motivated description of the surface. The locally periodic susceptibility profile is expanded into a Fourier series subject to a spatially varying phase parameter, and the GSTCs are rewritten in a form that enables them to be numerically solved for the reflected and transmitted surface fields. The phase parameter can either be determined from a prescribed surface transformation or extracted from known surface susceptibilities. A method for the extraction of this phase parameter from a susceptibility profile using a spatial variant of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is proposed. The scattered field at arbitrary detector locations is constructed by evaluating critical-point contributions of the first and second kinds using a forward ray-tracing (FRT) scheme. The accuracy of the resulting framework has been verified with an integral equation-based boundary element method (BEM)-GSTC full-wave solver for a variety of examples, such as a periodically modulated metasurface, a metasurface diffuser, and a beam collimator.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9540248","Electromagnetic (EM) metasurfaces;generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs);high-frequency methods;periodic structures;short-time Fourier Transformation;uniform theory of diffraction (UTD)","Metasurfaces;Optical surface waves;Scattering;Surface waves;Tensors;Integral equations;Diffraction","","10","","45","IEEE","16 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the HF band is widely used in many important civilian and military applications, HF DF systems are of great interest in electronic warfare support applications. However, due to the large wavelength, practical DF arrays mounted on moving platforms tend to be electrically small, resulting in fundamental limitations on antenna bandwidth and DF accuracy. Furthermore, many applications require mounting the array at a single location on the platform due to limited space and mobility considerations. To alleviate these issues, we employ the platform as the major radiator by exciting several of its significant characteristic modes (CMs) using a spatially confined antenna array. Specifically, we examined four DF array designs mounted on a representative, mid-size passenger airplane operating at 10 MHz in simulation, each of which is confined within a virtual sphere with a 3 m diameter. A scaled model of one design was fabricated and characterized. Cramer–Rao bounds and Monte Carlo test results are also reported.

Antenna-in-package (AiP) integrating active RF transceivers is considered a reliable means to shorten RF circuit path lengths and connectors to enhance user equipment (UE) antennas’ radiation characteristics. However, due to the several mechanical limitations and fabrication uncertainty at mmW frequencies, AiP implementation should better consider geometric parameter effects, which may degrade its radiation performance, to reduce beamforming complexity for easy design and low-cost fabrication. Besides, by taking advantage of active RF transceiver modules to provide output amplitude ratios and phase variations, the feeding circuits can be simplified to shorten the feeding microstrip line lengths. These effects are examined and presented in this article for a practical design of an AiP fabricated for validation by comparing full-wave simulations and measurement results.

In this research, the absorbed power in a worker honey bee and the influence of the bee’s presence on antennas’ radiation performance are investigated for the newly used frequencies in 5G networks from 6 to 240 GHz. To these aims, numerical simulations using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method were performed, in which a bee model, obtained by micro-CT scanning, was employed. These simulations showed that, in the near field, the absorbed power can increase by a factor of 53 from 6 to 240 GHz. This is a factor of 7 higher than the increase reported in the far-field in previous studies. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that antennas’ radiation efficiency can decrease by up to −40% when a bee appears in the near field. Likewise, it was found that the gain pattern depends on the separation distance between the bee and the antenna with a stronger dependency for higher frequencies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111286","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(grant numbers:G033220N); FWO(grant numbers:12U1417N); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9539081","Dipole antenna;finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method;millimeter waves;near field;radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs);RF-EMF exposure;western honey bees","Insects;Dielectrics;Antennas;Dipole antennas;Numerical models;Absorption;Solid modeling","","13","","31","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, compact size is essential for emerging application areas such as Internet of Things (IoT), wearable and implantable devices, 5G technology, or medical imaging. On the other hand, reduction of physical dimensions generally has a detrimental effect on antenna performance. From the perspective of numerical optimization, miniaturization is a heavily constrained problem, with most constraints being expensive to evaluate due to involving full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation. A convenient way of handling such a task is a penalty function approach where constraint violations contribute, upon suitable scaling, to the primary objective, i.e., the antenna size. The penalty coefficients determining the aforementioned contributions are normally adjusted through engineering experience, which does not allow for a reliable control of antenna performance figures. This article proposes an efficient management scheme for adaptive adjustment of penalty coefficients, which eliminates the need for objective function setup by trial and error, and ensures precise control of the design constraints. Our approach is demonstrated using three broadband antennas optimized for minimum size with acceptance thresholds imposed on the in-band matching level. The adaptive adjustment of penalty coefficients is shown to outperform experience-driven setups in terms of constraint control precision and the final design quality.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111285","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:217771); National Science Centre of Poland(grant numbers:2020/37/B/ST7/01448); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538972","Antenna design;compact antennas;constraint handling;electromagnetic (EM)-driven optimization;penalty functions;size reduction","Antennas;Optimization;Broadband antennas;Task analysis;Dielectric resonator antennas;Reflector antennas;Constraint handling","","32","","83","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce such computational cost to build an accurate model, a general framework to build surrogate models for the FDTD computation in the human body based on the least angle regression (LARS) method and the artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. The LARS method is adapted to dynamically select a number of informative random parameters which are significantly relevant to system outputs. We design a series of convergence criteria for ANN and introduce the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) optimizer to ANN in order to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of ANN.

The signal generator is designed based on a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) and a phase lock loop (PLL). In the DDS–PLL signal generator, the conventional divider in PLL is replaced with a mixer, comb generator, and a doubler to utilize high phase control resolution of DDS (14 bit, 0.022°) as it is to synchronize the DDS–PLL signal generator with the entire system. In the DBR, the output signals of the DDS–PLL signal generators are used as the second local oscillator (LO) signal, and the beamforming technique is implemented through the change of the phase of the second LO signals. Also, for sophisticated beamforming, all signal generator components in the DBR are synchronized for generating same and fixed frequency and phase. Finally, the DBR has the same phase control resolution as the DDS, and the phase of each chain of the DBR can be adjusted up to 0.022° (14 bit). The DBR using the DDS–PLL signal generator is designed and fabricated. The DBR consists of a  $1 \times 8$  array tapered slot antenna (TSA) part, a first and second frequency conversion part, a  $1 \times 8$  data acquisition and combiner part, DDS–PLL signal generator part, and a reference signal generator part. The phase control performance of the DBR was verified by measuring the phase change of the chain in the DBR according to the DDS phase change. Also, to verify the beamforming performance of the DBR with high beam control resolution, the radiation pattern of the DBR when the angle of the main lobe was 0°, 0.2°, 0.4°, 15°, and 30° was measured in the 28 GHz band.

At first, a single frequency is modulated onto a THz carrier due to the switching activity inside the FPGA and this modulated frequency is received at a distance. The effects of polarization and the receiver distance on the backscattered signal are studied and it is found that deliberately introducing a polarization mismatch between the transmitter and the receiver can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than 10 dB. This allows the signal to be received at distances greater than 45 cm with SNR above 54 dB, making detection feasible at several meters away. Through the use of a near-field focuser, the properties of the side-channel signal are measured over the surface of the FPGA board with a resolution of 0.5 mm. Next, a backscatter signal at four distinct frequencies is created and detected through splitting the FPGA into four distinct modules. The relative strength of the frequencies is compared, and conclusions about the physical location and the strength of these signals originating from distinct modules are analyzed. It is found that focusing the backscatter system on certain locations on the FPGA can preferentially receive the signal from one module while filtering out the other modules. This helps isolating the signals created by various modules in an FPGA and significantly improving the effectiveness of side-channel detection techniques.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111165","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:1651273); Office of Naval Research (ONR)(grant numbers:N00014-19-1-2287); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538977","Electromagnetic (EM) side channel;polarization;sensing;terahertz (THz) focusing","Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency modulation;Receivers;Integrated circuit modeling;Backscatter;Monitoring;Signal to noise ratio","","4","","31","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The radiating element comprises a rectangular radiating aperture fed by two smaller flared square waveguide sections via a bifurcated H-plane surface discontinuity. For the simultaneous feeding of the two-port radiating element, the total antenna includes a compact H-plane power divider. Properly weighted TE $_{n0}$  modes ( $n\in N^{\ast }$ ) are excited at the output of the two flared waveguide sections. The bifurcation is responsible for the recombination of the incoming fields. The low-dispersive modal coupling coefficients (or transmission coefficients of the bifurcation’s generalized scattering matrix) between the excitation and the aperture modes enable the broadband realization of the targeted aperture modal content. The common waveguide section is responsible for the phase alignment of the aperture modes.

By specially engineering the metallic patch of a conventional microstrip antenna into two tightly connected radiators, i.e., a primary patch radiator and a secondary stub-loaded inverted-F radiator, this novel hybrid-mode patch antenna under dual closely located resonances of a TM01 patch resonator mode and an inverted-F resonator mode is favorably achieved. More importantly, the stub-loaded inverted-F radiator could not only introduce two radiation nulls allocated at both the lower and upper passband edges, leading to a good filtering response with a sharp band skirt and good selectivity in the boresight gain curve, but also function as an effective isolator that suppresses its near-field coupling, endowing its intrinsic self-decoupling property. Moreover, the developed patch antenna maintains the geometrical advantages of the typical microstrip antenna, including compact size, low profile, and single-layer configuration. In particular, the unique self-decoupling and filtering properties of the developed patch antenna make it a good candidate for multiantenna systems consisting of antenna elements operating at both the same bands and adjacent bands. Prototypes of the self-decoupled filtering patch antenna alone and two types of two-element arrays operating at the same band and adjacent bands, respectively, have been designed, fabricated, and measured.

First, four small patches arranged in chessboard pattern are utilized as the main radiator, and meanwhile, a cross slot with unequal slot lengths is adopted to excite triple sequentially orthogonal modes, aiming to attain two CP modes (AR1 and AR2). Second, in order to further considerably enhance the AR bandwidth and concurrently reduce the overall size, the feeding cross-slot resonance is favorably excited and effectively coupled by the chessboard patches to produce a new slotline-based CP mode (AR3) located before AR1. Finally, an I-shaped top-loaded monopole fence, as a new degree of design freedom, is employed to collaboratively regulate these multiple resonances to form a wide AR bandwidth covering AR1, AR2, and AR3. Results show that, on the premise of keeping the inherent compact-size and low-profile advantages of microstrip antenna, the 3 dB AR bandwidth is remarkably enhanced up to 30.1% by the combination of the three CP modes. Based on the design method, a wideband polarization-reconfigurable antenna with switchable linear polarization (LP), left-handed circular polarization (LHCP), and right-handed circular polarization (RHCP) states is further designed and experimentally validated.

The phase shifters further provide additional variable phases of −90° to 0° for antenna element excitation. Superposition of the initial and additional phases helps to satisfy full and continuous 360° phase coverage for a beam-steerable array.

To the best knowledge of the authors, the proposed RDA with circular polarization, which is promising for tracking free-moving targets, is the first differential RDA enabled by specifically designed low-cost CMOS chips.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3111206","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2204701); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61831006,62022023,61950410609); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20190011); High-Level Innovation and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program in Jiangsu(grant numbers:2019-2004); key research and development program of Jiangsu province(grant numbers:BE2021007-2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538842","Automatic tracking;circular polarization (CP);CMOS;differential circuits;retrodirective array (RDA)","Radio frequency;Mixers;Microstrip antenna arrays;Frequency measurement;Gain;Phased arrays;Power amplifiers","","3","","16","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
