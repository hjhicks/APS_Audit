The standard approach to this problem involves sophisticated algorithms for extraction and clustering of multipath components, following which point estimates of the model parameters can be obtained using specialized estimators. We propose a likelihood-free calibration method using approximate Bayesian computation. The method is based on the maximum mean discrepancy, which is a notion of distance between probability distributions. Our method not only by-passes the need to implement any high-resolution or clustering algorithm but is also automatic in that it does not require any additional input or manual preprocessing from the user. It also has the advantage of returning an entire posterior distribution on the value of the parameters, rather than a simple point estimate. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by fitting two different stochastic channel models, namely the Saleh–Valenzuela model and the propagation graph model, to both simulated and measured data. The proposed method is able to estimate the parameters of both the models accurately in simulations, as well as when applied to 60 GHz indoor measurement data.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3083761","Danish Council for Independent Research(grant numbers:DFF 7017-00265); Lloyds Register Foundation Program on Data-Centric Engineering at The Alan Turing Institute through the EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/N510129/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445690","Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC);calibration;kernel methods;likelihood-free inference;machine learning;maximum mean discrepancy (MMD);radio channel modeling","Calibration;Stochastic processes;Channel models;Data models;Computational modeling;Kernel;Frequency measurement","","3","","73","CCBY","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the existing clustering algorithms require prior knowledge of clusters, initialization, and threshold choices. An accurate and automatic cluster identification algorithm is therefore highly desirable for channel modeling. In this article, adaptive kernel-power-density (AKPD) and support vector machine-assisted AKPD (SVM-AKPD) algorithms are proposed. First, a new distance-based metric is proposed to calculate an adaptive-K for each multipath component (MPC), in which the AKPD can be used in scenarios where we have a complex distribution of MPCs, especially for the cluster with small MPCs. Furthermore, the SVM is applied in clustering by the full partition of MPCs’ feature space to overcome the limitation of the AKPD, where the MPCs lying at a large distance from the cluster centroids will be clustered into surrounding clusters when the clusters are closely spaced in the AKPD. Finally, the performance of the proposed AKPD and SVM-AKPD is validated with measured and simulated channels data at millimeter waveband, respectively. Both numerical simulations and experimental validation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithms enable applications in multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) channels with no prior knowledge about the clusters, such as number and initial locations. It also does not need to adjust cluster parameters manually and can be implemented for cluster-based channel modeling with a fairly low complexity.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3140538","National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61931001,61771194); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9677979","Channel measurement and modeling;cluster;kernel density;multipath component (MPC);multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);support vector machine (SVM);wireless channel","Clustering algorithms;Delays;Support vector machines;MIMO communication;Channel models;Adaptation models;Wireless communication","","8","","42","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article investigates the MPCs clustering based on machine learning (ML) and analyzes the cluster characteristics in typical high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. A variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based algorithm is introduced to achieve the space–time clustering of MPCs, which incorporates the statistical characteristics of MPCs and can automatically determine the optimum number of clusters. Moreover, a novel density-based validity index is proposed for evaluating the MPCs clustering performance. The proposed validity index improves the traditional index by considering the intracluster density, which can be calculated according to the Graham scanning method and Green’s formula. In addition to synthetic datasets, realistic MPCs datasets collected in an HSR obstructed viaduct scenario are used for the performance evaluation of the clustering algorithm and clustering validity index. Based on clustering results in the measured scenario, static cluster characteristics, including cluster number, intercluster and intracluster delay spreads (DSs) and angle spreads (ASs), and dynamic cluster characteristics such as cluster lifetime and birth and death property of clusters, are extracted and analyzed.

Especially, the refined mapping model of maximum usable frequency (MUF) propagation factor for one hop on the F2 layer is first reconstructed by using the statistical machine learning method. Then, the new mapping models of conversion factors of optimum working frequency (OWF) and the highest probable frequency (HPF) are proposed by using the fine-grained solar activity parameters and coupling with two geomagnetic activity parameters.

In this article, a general framework of Mahalanobis-distance metric is proposed for MPC clustering in the MIMO channel analysis, without user-specified parameters. Remarkably, the popular multipath component distance (MCD) is proven to be a special case of the proposed distance metric framework. Furthermore, two machine learning algorithms, namely, weak-supervised Mahalanobis metric for clustering and supervised large margin nearest neighbor, are introduced to learn the distance metric. To evaluate the effectiveness, a modified channel model is proposed based on the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) spatial channel model (SCM) to generate clustered MPCs with delay and angular information since the original 3GPP SCM is incapable to evaluate clustering quality. Experiment results show that the proposed distance metric can significantly improve the clustering quality of existing clustering algorithms, while the learning phase requires considerably limited efforts of labeling MPCs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3143253","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62027806); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9713678","Machine learning;multi-in–multiout (MIMO) channel modeling;multipath component (MPC) clustering","Measurement;Clustering algorithms;Delays;MIMO communication;Channel models;Partitioning algorithms;Machine learning algorithms","","3","","36","IEEE","14 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurate modeling and simulation of wireless channel is the base for efficient design and performance evaluation. This becomes more important for industrial scenarios, which might be highly dynamic and potentially different from well-investigated cellular deployment scenarios. In this work, a novel semi-deterministic mmWave dynamic channel modeling approach based on optimal neural network (ONN) principle is proposed. The ONNs are radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) trained with optimal variance parameters and are applied to predict large-scale channel parameters (LSCPs) [e.g., path loss (PL), delay spread (DS), and angle spread (AS)]. Based on the ONNs’ predicted large-scale parameters and simplified propagation environment including the layout of transmitter (TX), receiver (RX), and major scatterers, the proposed channel modeling approach can generate accurate dynamic channel parameters.

Statistical models with slope-intercept fit fall short in capturing large variations seen in urban canyons, whereas ray tracing, capable of characterizing site-specific features, faces challenges in describing foliage and street clutter and associated reflection/diffraction ray calculation. Machine learning (ML) is promising but faces three key challenges in PL prediction: 1) insufficient measurement data; 2) lack of extrapolation to new streets; 3) overwhelmingly complex features/models. We propose an ML-based urban canyon PL prediction model based on extensive 28 GHz measurements from Manhattan where street clutters are modeled via a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud dataset and buildings by a mesh-grid building dataset. We extract expert knowledge-driven street clutter features from the point cloud and aggressively compress the 3-D building information using a convolutional autoencoder. Using a new street-by-street training and testing procedure to improve generalizability, the proposed model using both clutter and building features achieves a prediction error [root-mean-square error (RMSE)] of 4.8 ± 1.1 dB compared to 10.6 ± 4.4 and 6.5 ± 2.0 dB for 3GPP line of sight (LOS) and slope-intercept prediction, respectively, where the standard deviation indicates street-by-street variation.

The impact of such models that can “generalize” to new geometries is more profound for large-scale computations, such as those encountered in wireless propagation scenarios. We present generalizable models for indoor propagation that can predict received signal strengths within new geometries, beyond those of the training set of the model, for transmitters and receivers of multiple positions, and for new frequencies. We show that a convolutional neural network can “learn” the physics of indoor radiowave propagation from ray-tracing solutions of a small set of training geometries so that it can eventually deal with substantially different geometries.

At mmWaves/sub-THz frequencies, MIMO channels exhibit few leading paths in the space-time (ST) domain (i.e., directions or arrival/departure and delays). Algebraic low-rank (LR) channel estimation exploits ST channel sparsity through the computation of position-dependent MIMO channel eigenmodes leveraging recurrent training vehicle passages in the coverage cell. LR requires vehicles’ geographical positions and tens to hundreds of training vehicles’ passages for each position, leading to significant complexity and control signaling overhead. Here, we design a deep-learning (DL)-based LR channel estimation method to infer MIMO channel eigenmodes in V2X urban settings, starting from a single least squares (LS) channel estimate and without needing vehicle’s position information. Numerical results show that the proposed method attains comparable mean squared error (mse) performance as the position-based LR. Moreover, we show that the proposed model can be trained on a reference scenario and be effectively transferred to urban contexts with different ST channel features, providing comparable mse performance without an explicit transfer learning procedure.

In this article, we present an efficient and credible ML-based radio propagation modeling framework for indoor environments.

Our model is trained over multiple indoor geometries and frequency bands, and it can eventually predict the PL for unknown indoor geometries and frequency bands within a few milliseconds.

However, the transformed lenses, usually having a long focal length, suffer from limited volume reduction, severe reflection, narrow beamscanning range (BSR), and low capture efficiency. The proposed TO mapping in this article, engendered by transforming the upper and lower parts of the original LL separately, preserves the original beamsteering property of an LL in half a space with the focus retained at its flat surface before exerting any index approximations. The effects of the approximations and the discretization on the performance of the transformed LL are then investigated and analyzed comprehensively. After that, a hemispherical lens with a radius of 60 mm is exemplified at X-band and fabricated using a ten-layered nonresonant gradient index MTM.

By sealing the aperture partially, the dimension of the proposed half-OCA (HOCA) is reduced dramatically without changing the matching bandwidth and the radiation performance. Compared with other OCAs with the omnidirectional radiation, the proposed dual-antenna pair realizes omnidirectional coverage in azimuth plane by the back-to-back combination of two unidirectional OCAs, which also makes the antenna have multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) performance.

It is crucial to account for these coupling effects in numerical simulations and to implement realistic antenna models, e.g., for full-waveform inversion (FWI). We present a method of developing and adapting 3-D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) models of GPR antennas, complete with electric components, dielectric material properties, and feed pulse details. We exemplify this with a commercially available, shielded 400 MHz GPR antenna, a model of which was set up by fitting synthetic data to an experimental signal of the antenna reflected at a metal plate in the air. For this FWI, we used a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm because the fit parameters show complex individual effects on the GPR waveform. The resulting antenna model is then validated against data measured in air, water, and with a metal plate in the near field of the antenna. Overall, the synthetic data reproduce the validation data very accurately. Signals of objects placed in the near field of the antenna and the change of the shape and frequency content of the radiated wavelet with varying subsurface properties are emulated correctly.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3142335","German Federal Ministry of Defence(grant numbers:C/E520/HF022/EF120,C/E520/IF008/JF005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686638","Electromagnetic (EM) propagation;finite difference methods;geophysics computing;ground-penetrating radar (GPR);particle swarm optimization;ultrawideband antennas","Antennas;Antenna measurements;Numerical models;Finite difference methods;Time-domain analysis;Geophysical measurements;Three-dimensional displays","","16","","61","CCBY","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, a pair of individual antennas is used in the radar, one for transmit and one for receive. These antennas are usually closely spaced for reasons of both portability and close in detectability. A variety of design techniques are used to achieve their wideband performance in terms of return loss, isolation, radiation patterns, polarization, and impulse formation. Not only the antenna elements but also their surrounds form the overall antenna structure and this ensemble becomes integral to the antenna performance and design process. Both the antenna and the surrounding structure can create late time signals or time sidelobes, which are in effect a form of self-generated clutter. Minimizing the duration of the antenna impulse response assists in reducing self-generated clutter and achieving optimum radar performance. This article considers the impact of the antenna on the system performance of the radar and shows that the clutter performance of the antenna can be the prime metric of system detection rather than the noise figure, given that the self-clutter often exceeds the latter.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3142309","“Scanning Electromagnetic Mine Inspection System (SEMIS III)” funded from the charity Sir Bobby Charlton Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686597","Antennas;ground penetrating radar (GPR);ring down;ultrawideband (UWB) radar","Radar antennas;Radar;Receiving antennas;Landmine detection;Clutter;Soil;Transmitting antennas","","15","","49","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The same antenna elements can still be used for multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) when not in talk position without heavily degrading their fundamental capacity limit, but this is of secondary importance. The concept could be applied to frequency ranges used in mobile communications from 1.8 to 6 GHz where the ground plane has sufficient form factor. Extensive simulations using two planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) operating at 2.4 GHz are carried out to demonstrate conceptually how two antennas can be optimized to reduce SAR by over 50% compared to a single antenna element. SAR reduction is maintained regardless of the user’s head composition and how they are handling the device in a talk position.

This previous lens, while being of lightweight and economical construction, suffered from anisotropy resulting in a focal length that varied with the inclination of the beam relative to the orientation of the cubic grid. The lens described here largely overcomes this problem and allows for simpler and more economical construction. A prototype lens designed for the 3.3–3.8 GHz band with a diameter of 400 mm and a beamwidth of 14° was tested. Radiation patterns at wide scanning angles were nearly identical, and cross-polarization for slant incident polarization was below −25 dB on boresight and below −18 dB for all angles. A characteristic of this lens construction is its extremely high efficiency. The measured gain at the mid-band was 21.6 dBi, agreeing with simulated gain based on lossless materials to within measurement error.

However, the antenna-on-chip (AoC) suffers from poor radiation due to the lossy silicon substrate in standard complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) processes. Artificial magnetic conductors (AMCs) with the ground plane above the silicon can enhance the radiation; however, fitting the AMC completely in the thin stack-up (~10–15  $\mu \text{m}$ ) is extremely challenging, particularly for frequencies below 100 GHz. In this article, metallic posts (MPs) and embedded guiding structures (EGSs) have been investigated to reduce the AMC thickness by employing the available vias and metal layers in the stack-up. An in-house CMOS-compatible process has been used to realize the AoC, where typical low-conductivity adhesion layers have been avoided to reduce the undesired losses by using the surface roughness in a unique fashion. With MP and EGS approaches, AMC thickness can be reduced by 33% and 41%, respectively. The AMC with EGS fits within an oxide of a thickness of 16  $\mu \text{m}$ . A monopole antenna, backed by this AMC, demonstrates a gain of 5.85 dBi and a radiation efficiency of 57% at 94 GHz, bettering the gain and radiation efficiency by 9.15 dB and 42%, respectively, compared to the case without AMC.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3140528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678046","Artificial magnetic conductor (AMC);embedded guiding structure (EGS);gain enhancement;metallic posts (MPs);on-chip antenna;system-on-chip (SoC)","Silicon;Substrates;Antennas;Gain;Metals;System-on-chip;Adhesives","","29","","41","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traditional strategy treats the blockage and antennas as a whole system, leading to increased difficulty in analysis and research on the mechanism of blockage. Thus, this article presents a novel method. On the basis of the Fresnel zone theory of electromagnetic propagation, the main shadow region of electromagnetic propagation of the conformal array by the fixed blockage is found. Then, the shadow region is divided into small scattering elements, which significantly reduces the scope of the solution. Additionally, an association model between the blockage–conformal array system and isolated element is established based on the characteristic modes of isolated elements and coordinate transformation.

When the conventional beam tilting method is applied to CP-RLSA antennas, the aperture efficiency of the antenna degrades significantly due to very sparse slots in some parts of the antenna. A new method is presented to prevent this, and hence a much higher gain and aperture efficiency are achieved from the same antenna area. The key to the new method is an aggressively biased truncation of the slot layout that leaves out sparse slots. Consequently, the feed point moves closer to an edge of the TEM waveguide. A reflecting wall is introduced to prevent leakage from this edge. It is shown that the gain of RLSAs with beams tilted to 25° and 45° (measured from normal direction) can be increased by 5.5 dB (from 20.5 to 26 dBic) using the new method as opposed to the conventional method. The new concept and predicted results are validated using a prototype antenna with the beam-tilted to an angle of 25°. The aperture diameter and overall thickness of the prototype are  $12\lambda _{0}$  and  $0.4\lambda _{0}$ , respectively, where  $\lambda _{0}$  is the free-space wavelength at the operating frequency of 18 GHz.

Primary and secondary feed networks are designed in series configurations, in which resonant-type phase-shifters are periodically inserted. The beam-scanning of this antenna array is solely controlled by frequency in one dimension, while it is controlled by a combination of frequency and resonant-type phase-shifter in the other dimension.

By decomposing the radiation pattern of irregular arrays (IAs) into the product of subarray pattern and subarray array factor, the principal factor for the reduction of directivity and the appearance of high sidelobes is analyzed. Aimed at maximizing directivity of IAs, a binary quadratic optimization problem (BQOP) is established for the design of subarray tiling configuration, where the directivities at considered scanning angles satisfying given peak sidelobes level (SLL) is maximized. To consider the directivities at all the scanning angles within given scan ranges, a concept of “generalized directivity” is introduced and defined. Meanwhile, it is known that high directivity usually enables to suppress high SLL to a great extent. Therefore, the BQOP is reduced to a simplified binary quadratic problem (SBQP) for the maximization of the “generalized directivity” without the high-dimensional constraint on SLL. The associated complex excitations at subarray level are solved using convex optimization after the subarray tiling configuration is determined.

In this work, we derive an optimization algorithm for an electronically switchable subarray of phased array at the ground station that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) depending on the range of elevation angles of satellite. The algorithm optimizes the SNR by adapting the interelement spacing between array elements considering the impact of molecular absorption loss and noise, thermal noise from the sky and the ground. In comparison to uniform phased array design with equal spacing, the SNR can be improved for a typical scenario by about 3 dB and thus improving the link performance.

A low profile is also highly desired to integrate the antenna system into a variety of moving platforms, such as aircraft and trains. An ultra-low-profile continuous transverse stub array is proposed here to tackle these challenges. The antenna array is realized in printed circuit board technology by adopting a contactless transition between the stacked-up layers without resorting to blind or buried vias. The proposed antenna is wideband (impedance matched within the 19–31 GHz band, i.e., ~50%) and provides multibeam radiation for polar angles as far as ±22.5°. The peak value of the gain is 19.7 dBi, and the maximum radiation efficiency equals 50%. Furthermore, the antenna array is combined with a dual-band polarization converter. The latter provides orthogonal circular polarization (CP) in two non-adjacent bands. The overall antenna system performs right- and left-hand CPs within the SatCom downlink and uplink in the K-/Ka-band, respectively.

If the objective function of adaptive beamformer is defined by some properties other than the deterministic properties of arrays such as directivity or signal-to-noise ratio, evolutionary optimization is advantageously implemented to minimize the objective function. Nevertheless, the convergence time of most of the evolutionary optimization methods exponentially increases by the number of array elements  $N$ . For large  $N$ , the above convergence issue slows down the beamforming agility. To improve the above inefficiency, we first express the array factor by a Schelkunoff polynomial of order  $N - 1$ . Second, a discrete optimization method like genetic algorithm optimally factorizes the polynomial into two polynomials of orders  $N - 1 - P$  and  $P$ , where  $N - 1 - P \ge P$ . Third, the locations of zeros of these polynomials are optimized across the visible region by a continuous optimization method like particle swarm optimization to attain the desired objective function. When these two polynomials are multiplied, the resultant polynomial of order  $N - 1$  demonstrates improved features with respect to the original polynomial of order  $N - 1$  in sensitivity, sidelobe level, and convergence.

For an arbitrary linear polarized incident plane wave, the decomposed orthogonally polarized waves can also be reflected toward two predefined directions based on the dual-polarized independent tunability of the proposed design. As for polarization conversion, the reflected waves can be flexibly switched among linear-to-orthogonal (LP-to-XP), linear-to-circular, and linear-to-elliptical polarizations in the operating frequencies depending on the phase requirement. The polarization conversion ratio is up to 90% for LP-to-XP polarization and the axial ratio is smaller than 3 dB for linear-to-circular polarizations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3140506","Guangdong-Hong Kong Joint Laboratory for Big Data Imaging and Communication(grant numbers:2020B1212030002); The Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology, China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678050","Active component;beam steering;dual polarization;multifunctional metasurface;polarization conversion","Varactors;Metasurfaces;Substrates;Voltage;Metals;Beam steering;Surface waves","","41","","45","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a novel design of a metamirror exhibiting both spin-selective absorption and phase modulation properties. A chiral metamirror with asymmetric split-ring resonators (ASRRs) is proposed to achieve spin-selective reflection/absorption. Meanwhile, a geometric phase is introduced to provide a full  $2\pi $  reflection-phase coverage. Theoretical results indicate a maximum absorption of 99.34% for left-handed circularly polarized (LHCP) wave, while keeping the reflection of right-handed circularly polarized (RHCP) higher than 91% without changing the handedness. By virtue of the above merits, we implement a metadevice that can convert incident RHCP waves into vortex waves with identical handedness from 8.3 to 10.3 GHz and absorb incident LHCP waves at its operation band. For experimental verification, a proof-of-concept metamirror is fabricated and experimentally characterized, which reveals the spin-dependent bifunctional performances of the proposed metamirror.

In this article, we propose a promising scheme to push the development of this issue and achieve wide-angle electromagnetic (EM) absorption in a dynamically controllable manner via a reconfigurable origami-based metamaterial. For this purpose, the Miura-ori sheet is applied to load the meta-atoms with cross-shaped resistive films. Accordingly, the wide-angle absorption characteristics of the origami absorber change drastically by adjusting the folded states. In contrast with the conventional 2-D and 3-D absorbers, the 3-D origami absorber state has four normal vectors. Thus, it provides an excellent approach to prevent the deterioration of absorption in a wide-angle range. When the folding angle  $\theta =35$ °, the origami absorber exhibits an ultrawideband absorption of 1.44–40 GHz and wide-angle absorption up to 70°. As a proof-of-concept, a prototype that can shift the folding angle from 0° to 90° was fabricated. The absorption performances in the two folding states of fixed folding angles are numerically simulated and experimentally verified in the microwave regime. We believe that the better coverage incident-angle characteristics of the proposed reconfigurable origami-based absorber at specific folding state broaden its applications in various fields, such as EM pollution, radar technology, and EM invisibility.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3140521","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971437,61331005,61771485,61501503,61601507); Science and Technology Research Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2015KJXX-47); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678011","Metamaterials;origami;reconfigurable absorber","Absorption;Three-dimensional displays;Metamaterials;Radio frequency;Integrated circuit modeling;Substrates;Shape","","30","","58","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the reduced orthogonal couplings, the MJC can achieve nearly independent control of orthogonally-polarized waves. Then, via BPNN, a dictionary mapping between reflection phase and structural parameters of MJC is established to facilitate metasurface design using MJCs.

The stacked metasurface will generate collimated beams at the desired angles in each band upon reflection. The conductor-backed stacked metasurface consists of two metasurfaces (a patterned metallic cladding supported by a dielectric spacer) stacked one upon the other. The stacked metasurface is designed in three phases. First, the patterned metallic cladding of each metasurface is homogenized and modeled as an inhomogeneous impedance sheet. An electric field integral equation (EFIE) is written to model the mutual coupling between the homogenized elements within each metasurface and from metasurface to metasurface. The EFIE is transformed into matrix equations by the method of moments. The nonlinear matrix equations are solved at both bands iteratively resulting in dual-band complex-valued impedance sheets. In the second phase, optimization is applied to transform these complex-valued impedance sheets into purely reactive sheets suitable for printed circuit board fabrication by introducing surface waves. In the third phase, the metallic claddings of each metasurface are patterned for full-wave simulation of the dual-band stacked metasurface. Using this approach, two dual-band stacked metasurfaces are designed.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3142277","Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-19-1-0359); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-18-1-2536); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686644","Antennas;dual band;metasurface;method of moments;multilayer;stacked","Metasurfaces;Dual band;Surface impedance;Mathematical models;Impedance;Integral equations;Finite element analysis","","24","","34","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for electrically large metasurface with complex structures, it is difficult to implement the fast mapping from the codes, i.e., states of the active components, to radiation patterns and vice versa. In this article, artificial neural networks are employed to realize code-to-pattern (C-P) and pattern-to-code (P-C) mapping accurately and efficiently. As for the C-P mapping, a novel physics-inspired neural network (PINN), which is primarily inspired by the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method, is proposed. The PINN is physically interpretable and shows a strong few-shot learning ability. The average error between the patterns predicted by the PINN and measured patterns is as low as 2.31 dB. For the P-C mapping, a deep neural network (DNN) is proposed with PINN as its teacher network, i.e., PINN is used to generate more radiation patterns to train the DNN. The average accuracy of codes prediction is higher than 98.4%. Finally, an intelligent beamforming scheme is implemented by combining the PINN and DNN. For the desired patterns, the required codes could be accurately calculated by the DNN in real time. Then, the synthesized patterns of the required codes could be achieved by the PINN to compare with the desired patterns. The proposed scheme is a first step toward practical applications of PM in the fields of sensing and communication.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3140891","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679454","Deep neural network (DNN);few-shot learning;intelligent beamforming (IB);physics-inspired neural network (PINN);programmable metasurface (PM)","Codes;Metasurfaces;Array signal processing;Neural networks;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna measurements;Deep learning","","34","","30","IEEE","12 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each unit cell comprises stacked graphene, silicon dioxide, and slotted gold layer featuring 99.9% absorptivity as well as 34.01% transmittivity across the respective bands.

The lack of experimental facility at those frequencies accessible to the authors in their country has been compensated by verifying the simulated prediction using a circuit model developed inhouse.

IPO is based on iterative refinement of physical optics (PO) currents to include multiple reflections. However, IPO does not yield sufficient accuracy in diffraction dominant regions since it does not properly include effects of edge diffractions. Hence, the proposed approach includes diffraction effects using PTD, which introduces edge currents. Diffracted fields due to these edge currents are radiated on triangular facets to modify the PO currents before IPO iterations. Scattered fields are computed from converged IPO surface currents and PTD edge currents. A new set of PTD edge currents excited by the fields due to the IPO currents are also found and the fields radiated by these PTD edge currents are added to the scattered fields. Therefore, interactions between the surface and edge currents are included. Computations are accelerated by parallel processing using message passing interface (MPI). Monostatic and bistatic RCS are predicted using the proposed approach for tail-wing and trihedral corner reflector geometries.

It is essential to design and test mmWave 5G devices under various realistic scenarios since the radio propagation channels pose intrinsic limitations on the performance. This requires emulating realistic dynamic mmWave channels in a reproducible manner in laboratories, which is the goal of this article. In this contribution, we first illustrate the dominant-cluster(s) concept, where the nondominant clusters in the mmWave channels are pruned, for mmWave 5G devices applying massive MIMO beamforming. This demonstrates the importance and necessity to accurately emulate the mmWave channels at a cluster level rather than the composite-channel level. Thus, an over-the-air (OTA) emulation strategy for dynamic mmWave channels is proposed based on the concept of the dominant cluster(s) in a sectored multiprobe anechoic chamber (SMPAC). The key design parameters, including the probe number and the angular spacing of probes, are investigated through comprehensive simulations. A cost-effective switch circuit is also designed for this purpose and validated in the simulation. Furthermore, a dynamic mmWave channel measured in an indoor scenario at 28–30 GHz is presented, where the proposed emulation strategy is also validated by reproducing the measured reality.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664391","Beamforming;channel emulation;dynamic channels and clusters;massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);millimeter-wave (mmWave);multiprobe anechoic chamber (MPAC);over-the-air (OTA) testing","Radio frequency;Probes;Massive MIMO;Emulation;Testing;Vehicle dynamics;Performance evaluation","","10","","36","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we address this problem through a novel theoretical framework that combines stochastic indoor environment modeling with advanced physical propagation simulation. This approach is particularly adapted to investigate indoor-to-indoor 5G mmWave propagation. Its system implementation, so-called iGeoStat, generates parameterized typical environments that account for the indoor spatial variations, then simulates radio propagation based on the physical interaction between electromagnetic waves and material properties. This framework is not dedicated to a particular environment, material, frequency, or use case, and aims to statistically understand the influence of indoor environment parameters on mmWave propagation properties, especially coverage and path loss. Its implementation raises numerous computational challenges that we solve by formulating an adapted link budget and designing new memory optimization algorithms. The first simulation results for two major 5G applications are validated with measurement data and show the efficiency of iGeoStat to simulate multiple diffusion in realistic environments, within a reasonable amount of time and memory resources.

Signal propagation in the evaporation duct has been simulated using the parabolic equation model and compared to results obtained from an experimental setup in the Irish Sea. The best antenna heights and frequencies to maximize signal propagation at this location are also found. Results show that the evaporation duct can be used to provide high bandwidth communications beyond the horizon with an uptime of approximately 40%, and that weather data from buoys can be used to predict the performance of the communications link.

We address this problem with a hybrid approach. We employ the equivalence theorem to separate the inhomogeneous plasma region from the surrounding free space via an equivalent (Huygens) surface and the Eikonal approximation to Maxwell equations in the large inhomogeneous region for obtaining equivalent currents on the separating surface. Then, we obtain the scattered field via (exact) free-space radiation of these surface equivalent currents. The method is extensively tested against reference results and then applied to a real-life reentry vehicle with full 3-D plasma computed via computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. We address both scattering [radar cross section (RCS)] from the entire vehicle and radiation from the onboard antennas.

We propose a millimeter-wave space–time-coding digital metasurface (STCM) to realize simultaneous in situ direction finding and field manipulation. An analytic method of direction finding is first developed using the STCM modulated by a space–time-coding (STC) matrix while maintaining its original capability of EM field manipulations. In addition, three STC matrices corresponding to different EM functions are applied to the STCM to verify the feasibility and robustness of direction findings experimentally. Finally, a proof-of-concept prototype is built to exhibit different EM functions according to the incident angle detected simultaneously.

Several approximate methods have been suggested to speed up the calculation. These rely on removing one or more of the reflecting surfaces from the calculation domain and compensating for the effect through geometric optics arguments. This article presents a unified multilevel approximation formalism, which allows the user the freedom to tradeoff the simulation time, implementation complexity, and result accuracy as required for a specific application. As part of the formalism, a strategy to reliably remove both reflectors in a dual-reflector system from the calculation domain and rely on ray tracing to correct the background temperature is developed. It is shown that this new method reduces calculation time by several orders of magnitude while maintaining accuracy in the final antenna temperature result of the order of 1%. It is fast and accurate enough to be used in numerical optimization loops. The method requires the implementation of a ray tracing algorithm, and thus, may present some unnecessary complexity if only rough temperature estimates are required. To this end, a simplified method is also presented requiring no ray tracing and only simple postprocessing of readily available feed pattern data. Though not as accurate as of the ray tracing-based method, temperatures may be estimated with around 10% accuracy over bandwidths well in excess of a decade.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3145447","National Radio Astronomy Observatory, USA; National Research Foundation of South Africa(grant numbers:75322); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696231","Noise;radio astronomy;reflector antennas","Antennas;Ray tracing;Antenna radiation patterns;Brightness temperature;Antenna feeds;Temperature distribution;Temperature dependence","","5","","25","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To prevent this leakage, we propose transforming one of the PEC–PEC surfaces into artificial magnetic conductors (AMCs), creating a PEC–AMC layer that suppresses any leakage even with no contact between the surfaces where the gap is less than a quarter wavelength. A wideband multilayer pyramidal horn antenna using substrate-integrated gap waveguide (SIGW) technology is proposed as an example that highlights the proposed solution. In each layer of the horn, the opening is surrounded by periodic cells to suppress leakage and surface waves. In addition, the upper surface surrounding the horn’s opening is surrounded by EBG mushroom cells to act as a soft surface that suppresses the surface waves and reduces the edge diffraction, and, in turn, improves the radiation characteristics of the horn.

To mitigate the blockage effect resulting from the LB element, shorted patches are loaded on the LB radiator for suppressing its scattering in the HB frequency range.

A reliable, efficient, and repeatable over-the-air (OTA) testing method is vital for the research and development of wireless devices. Due to the particular advantages of the reverberation chamber (RC), it has become a popular facility to perform OTA tests nowadays. In the RC-based OTA tests, loading the RC with radio frequency (RF) absorbers is a standardized procedure to control the frequency selectivity of the RC channel according to the cellular telecommunications industry association (CTIA). However, this procedure involves iterative manual calibrations and, therefore, is tedious and time-consuming. Moreover, it may be difficult to tune the coherence bandwidth (CBW) to a desired value accurately given fixed RF absorbers. In this work, a locally switchable metamaterial absorber (MA) is proposed for fine-tuning of the CBW of the channel in the RC. It is experimentally verified that the CBW can be easily controlled by switching on and off of the absorbing/reflection units of the MA. The proposed MA can provide fine-tuning of the CBW in an efficient and convenient manner.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137302","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171362); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664504","Coherence bandwidth (CBW);metamaterial absorber (MA);over-the-air (OTA) testing;reverberation chamber (RC)","Absorption;Wireless communication;Tuning;Switches;Bandwidth;Metamaterials;Testing","","12","","32","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed tag consists of a slotted square patch antenna with a switchable resistor and a mechanically driven slider etched with a barcode-like metallic wire array. Encoding is achieved by the presence and absence of the metallic wire on the slider, and tag identification is obtained by sequential bit reading. A special encoding strategy is applied to improve its insensitivity to the motion velocity of the slider. For a proof-of-concept demonstration, a prototype designed to operate at 2.1 GHz was fabricated and measured, and the experimental results verified the effectiveness. Compared with the methods based on time-domain reflectometry, spectral signature, and resonator-based sequential encoding, the proposed approach provides a substantially enhanced data capacity within a narrow spectrum without sacrificing its reading range and tag size, due to the design of nonresonant code cell. Such a mechanically triggered chipless RFID tag exhibits promising potentials in some practical applications, such as personal ID and credit cards.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137199","NSFC(grant numbers:61771422,62071420,61771421,51777168); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (ZJNSF)(grant numbers:LR18F010001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664441","Chipless radio frequency identification (RFID);switchable wave impedance;time-domain scattering modulation","Encoding;Resistors;Wires;Patch antennas;Antenna measurements;Switches;Resonators","","3","","18","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the shortage of design-ready theoretical models, optimization is mainly based on electromagnetic (EM) analysis, which tends to be costly. Numerous techniques have evolved to abate this cost, including surrogate-assisted frameworks for global optimization, or sparse sensitivity updates for speeding up local search. In the latter, CPU-heavy updates of the system response sensitivity through finite differentiation are suppressed based on, e.g., the magnitude of design variability during the optimization run. Another approach is to incorporate variable-resolution simulations. Recently, a technique exploiting a continuous spectrum of admissible model fidelity levels has been reported, thereby allowing for a considerable reduction of computational expenditures. Seeking further savings, this work introduces an accelerated gradient-based algorithm with sparse sensitivity updates and variable-resolution EM simulations. Our technique is validated using four broadband antennas, and demonstrated to offer substantial (around 80%) savings over the benchmark while maintaining acceptable design quality.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3138487","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:217771); National Science Centre of Poland(grant numbers:2020/37/B/ST7/01448); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9670728","Antenna design;design specification adaptation;electromagnetic (EM)-driven optimization;multiband antennas;parameter tuning","Optimization;Antennas;Sensitivity;Costs;Computational modeling;Approximation algorithms;Adaptation models","","16","","58","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
