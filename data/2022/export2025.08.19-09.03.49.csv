The traditional method to achieve wide-angle beam-scanning is to employ mechanically controlled reflectors or lenses, which are bulky, heavy, and suffer from slow beam scanning speed. Other important limitations of mechanical scanning antennas include the lack of multi-beam scanning capability and the ability to conform with non-planar structures (conformal geometries), which are essential in a number of emerging systems requiring very low-profile antennas. An alternative technique is to employ electronically beam-scanning antennas using passive or active phased arrays [1]. Main disadvantages of phased arrays are high complexity, high power consumption, and high cost due to a large number of radio frequency (RF) or microwave phase shifters and T/R modules required. The problems worsen for phased arrays at millimeter-wave, sub-THz, and THz frequencies, due to significant losses in phase shifters and feed networks at higher frequencies combined with lower efficiency of power amplifiers [2]. The digital beamforming approach is even more costly and energy hungry due to the employment of large number of RF modules and digital devices [1], [3], [4].","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3208790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9913695","","Special issues and sections;Antennas;Wideband;Gain;Antenna arrays;Phased arrays;Lenses;Antenna measurements","","11","","9","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, the proposed method can also optimize the array unit size and achieve a small inter-unit distance for wide-angle scanning capability. A low-profile dual-polarization antenna operating in the bandwidth from 4.4 to 5.0 GHz is designed as a linear array and a planar array to verify the proposed method. Regardless of the linear array or planar array, the mutual coupling in the array is below −19 dB, which is better than that in conventional arrays. Meanwhile, the antenna unit in the array can radiate a wide-beam pattern. Two arrays can scan over ±60° for both polarizations.

To achieve 9:1 impedance bandwidth with extra-low profile, the distributed capacitance structure is added into the feeding balun instead of the traditional shorting strips for the resonance suppression. This structure can avoid introducing the parasitic loop-mode, the elimination of which generally increases the antenna profile based on existing methods. Furthermore, to improve the impedance matching without prominently increasing the antenna profile, a triply-layer folded meta-surface (MS) is designed and enables the wide-scanning capacity for the proposed antenna. In addition, by etching the orthogonally polarized slots on the folded MS, the 0°/180° reflection phase for the orthogonal-polarized incident wave can be achieved. The etched slots are tightly and periodically located to improve the bandwidth of 0°/180° reflection phase and maintain the impedance matching. When an incident wave with the orthogonal polarization arrives at the array, an ultrawideband RCS reduction can be achieved and the radiating performance is maintained, owning to the multifunctional MS without lossy loads. A  $19\times19$  prototype array is fabricated and measured to validate the correctness of this design.

For a dual-band radar system, the main challenge is to realize the shared-aperture array antenna having the wideband wide angle in the lower band and well-performed in the higher band. For example, the relative bandwidths of 25% in the Ku-band and 11.4% in the Ka-band are necessary for this work. The bandwidth of both bands is wider than that of existing works. To satisfy the wideband and wide beam coverage in two dimensions simultaneously, wideband radiating elements for both two bands are used. In this case, due to the wideband Ku-band radiator, the blind area in the Ka-band appears within the scanning process because of the parasitic mode, which should be eliminated by properly adjusting the Ku-band radiator. After that, the scanning angles of ± 60° at 14 GHz, ± 50° at 16 GHz, and ± 35° at 18 GHz, and ± 40° at 33 GHz, ± 40° at 35 GHz, and ± 35° at 37 GHz can be achieved in both E- and H-planes, respectively. Each Ku-band linear array is tightly inserted into its two adjacent Ka-band linear arrays along the wide side of the Ka-band element.

When the polarizer is close to the antenna array, its performance will become difficult to predict due to the influence of the antenna source. This will bring uncertainty to the cooperative work. We propose a codesign method of polarizer unit considering the factor of antenna array. This method can better design the polarizer working in the near field of antenna array. Next, to improve the CP scanning range, the polarizer is not composed of repeated units, but adopts a codesign partition scheme. We combine the polarizer unit specially designed for large-angle incidence and for normal incidence to a polarizer plane.

For the large-spacing arrays, the most critical problem is to avoid grating lobes as the beam scans. For this reason, the appearance of grating lobes in rectangular- and parallelogram-lattice arrangements is analyzed, and a new square-rate arrangement method is proposed, in which the specific position of the square-rate array is deduced to homogenize the grating lobes. In the end, the presented method is verified by numerical calculations, full-wave simulations, and representative measurements of an 8  $\times16$  array.

A GJC matrix has  $N $  columns to feed  $N $  antenna elements and  $M $  rows to feed  $M $  beams, and the direction of each individual beam can be controlled by tuning the phase shifters in the associated row of the GJC matrix. In this article, a matrix theory is developed, and an optimization algorithm is proposed to provide a mathematical tool for synthesizing such matrices and, consequently, the multiple beams. Using a particle swarm optimization algorithm, numerical results demonstrate that multibeams with independent control of individual beam directions and sidelobes can, indeed, be synthesized in a systematic manner.

Two orthogonally polarized slotted waveguide antennas (SWAs) are cross-placed as the main radiator, which is designed based on ridged waveguides (RGWs) to reduce the width of the waveguides and obtain a wider steering range. The two SWAs are fed by two pillbox reflector beamforming networks (BFNs), and a special impedance transition is designed to reduce the reflection between the quasi-TEM wave in the parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) to the TE10 wave. By exciting different feeding patches in the focal planes of the pillbox reflectors, the SWA achieves different beams. In order to further increase the crossover level, the single-port excitation (SPE) and the dual-port excitation (DPE) method are used together to increase the equivalent source number in the compact area of the focal plane. Besides, the DPE method can also reduce the sidelobe level (SLL) of the beams excited by the side ports. A prototype is designed at the operating frequency of 10 GHz and fabricated by the 3-D-printed technology and computer numerical control (CNC) technology. The measured results show that the proposed antenna achieves ± 36° beam scanning in the multibeam plane with the minimum crossover level of −2.1 dB. The cross polarizations are below −20.0 and −15.9 dB for the horizontal polarization (H-P) and the vertical polarization (V-P), respectively.

These novel fan-shaped slots exhibit extraordinary circular polarization (CP) radiation in high efficiency over a wide frequency band. Moreover, by switching the excitation ports, both left-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH) CPs are achieved in a wide beam steering range backward or forward. An SIW LWA prototype has been designed and tested with validate LHCP/RHCP steering beams ranging from –51° to 0° or from 51° to 0° in the elevation when the frequency varies from 27.4 to 37.3 GHz. In the 30% frequency band, the axial ratios (ARs) on the main beams are all less than 3 dB demonstrating the broadband CP characteristic. In this 1-D LWA, the realized gain varies from 12.4 to 17.9 dBi. However, it requires higher gain and a fixed beam but narrow bandwidth (BW) in some applications like CubeSats. Hence, a conformal LWA array is further introduced by combining the CP radiation of two LWAs deployed in two perpendicular surfaces of a one cubic unit (1U) CubeSat. Fed by an elaborated vertical transition, the conformal array is designed at 28 GHz with a high directive sum beam along the diagonal direction, requiring each LWA to radiate at ± 45°. As a result, the total gain is enhanced from 14.4 to 16.6 dBi with an AR of 1.8 dB and a sidelobe level (SLL) of −17.1 dB.

A miniaturized and broadband hybrid metasurface with a compact size of  $0.28\lambda _{0} \times 0.28\lambda _{0} \times 0.11\lambda _{0}$  is first proposed by combining a dielectric resonator and a  $3\times3$  mushroom-like metasurface.

To increase the beam-scanning range, the proposed pattern reconfigurable antenna as the array element is adopted in a phased array. For demonstration, a five-element hybrid metasurface linear array antenna using the reconfigurable element is fabricated and measured. It is operated in the band of 3.30–3.80 GHz (5G-N78 band). This reconfigurable method can extend the beam-scanning angle of the five-element array symmetrically from [−35°, +35°] to [−70°, +70°].

In this article, an alleviating technique based on a gain-compensating approach is proposed. Isolated element pattern (IEP) and array factor are jointly considered. When calculating the array factor, mutual couplings between antennas in an array are also included. The IEP is optimized in such a way that the element gain is nearly inversely proportional to the peak gain of the array factor. As a result, the peak gain of the overall array beam can be kept almost the same in a wide scanning range. As an example, a cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) array is investigated. In such a design, a dip is introduced to the top of the element pattern so that the top peak in the array factor envelope can be compensated. This idea is demonstrated by using an X-band cylindrical DRA, with its beam shaped by using a loading peripheral metal ring and two top dielectric slabs. This shaped-beam DRA element is used to construct a nine-element H-plane linear phased array. The element and array prototypes were fabricated and measured, and reasonable agreement between the measured and simulated results is observed. The measured 3-dB beamwidths of the DRA element are 172° and 149° in the E- and H-planes, respectively. It is found that the H-plane main beam of the DRA array can scan from  $- \mathrm{72}^{\circ }$  to  $+ \mathrm{72}^{\circ }$  with a small gain fluctuation of less than 0.9 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3199567","General Research Fund (GRF) Grant from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR, China(grant numbers:CityU 11218020); Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macau Science and Technology Project (Category C)(grant numbers:SGDX20210823104002018); Fundamental and Applied Basic Research Project of Guangzhou City(grant numbers:202201011813); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Sun Yat-sen University(grant numbers:22QNTD0501); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9866006","Beam shaping;dielectric resonator antenna (DRA);low gain fluctuation;wide-angle scanning;wide-beam antenna","Phased arrays;Antenna arrays;Antenna radiation patterns;Mutual coupling;Gain;Antenna measurements;Fluctuations","","32","","37","IEEE","23 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed decoupling method shows its effectiveness in  $1\times 2$  dielectric resonator (DR) antennas (DRAs) even with zero spacing. Conformal strips are attached to the sidewall of the DRs and parallel to the E-plane of the DRAs. Coupled from the resonant DR, the conformal strips can generate an induced current, thus forming an induced field inside the DR. It can be noted that, inside the two DRs, the DR resonant field and the strip induced field are antiphase and in-phase, respectively. Tuning the conformal strips can change the amplitude ratio and phase difference between the resonant and induced fields, which can be used to cancel the fields inside the DR based on the superposition principle. When one DR is excited, the field inside the other DR can be very weak. The DRs can then work at their fundamental TE $_{\delta 11}$  modes independently. Therefore, their radiation patterns are not distorted together with high port isolation. A new indicator, energy storage proportion (ESP), is proposed to evaluate the decoupling effect. It can be found that, when the ESP gets close to 1, the radiation patterns will be restored together with high isolation. To verify the idea,  $1\times 2$  DRAs are designed, fabricated, and measured. A reasonable agreement can be observed between the measured and simulated results for both H- and E-plane decoupled cases. All the measured overlapping impedance bandwidths are larger than 6%, the envelope correlation coefficients are lower than 0.059, and the isolations are higher than 20 dB.

The antenna can electrically select its polarization among three linear polarization (LP) modes of  $x$ -,  $y$ -, and 45°-direction with stable high gain. To achieve these properties, we devise a novel polarization conversion partially reflective surface (PCPRS) as a superstrate. The PCPRS plays two crucial roles simultaneously; it reconfigures antenna polarization and maintains high gain using an FP resonance between the PCPRS and a ground plane. The FP resonance, which is the key point in our antenna design, is essential to maximize both antenna gain and polarization reconfigurability. Therefore, in order to stably achieve the FP resonance for all three polarization modes, we have designed the PCPRS to keep its reflection behavior as constant as possible for all LP modes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first FPC antenna introducing a partially reflective surface (PRS) which also functions as an active polarizer. Consequently, the proposed antenna attains remarkable polarization conversion performance with higher than 20 dB cross-polarization suppression level for all polarization modes. Moreover, in all modes, our antenna well maintains reasonably high gain of about 15 dBi with good impedance matching properties.

Compared with the traditional lens, the focal length of the proposed novel metal lens can be of any value in theory; in other words, the focal diameter ratio ( $f/D$ ) can be arbitrarily adjusted. The metal 3-D printed technology is used to reduce the fabrication cost. The unit cell of the lens is a square open-ended waveguide. Since the phase velocity of the electromagnetic wave in the metal waveguide is faster than that in the air, the phase compensation can be controlled by adjusting the height of each unit of the lens. It helps to realize the conversion from the quasi-spherical wave of the feed source to the plane wave radiation of the lens. Due to the use of symmetrical elements, the lens can support different dual-polarized radiation (dual-linear polarization and dual-circular polarization). Considering the processing cost and design difficulty, a metal lens with  $9\times $  9 unit cells was processed to verify our design. The  $f/D$  is selected as 1. Simulated results for the lens antenna show a peak aperture efficiency (AE) of 43.8% and 38% for linearly polarized (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) radiation, respectively. The antenna shows a stable pattern and wide 3 dB gain bandwidth (26–40 GHz), which covers the entire Ka-band. The measured results of the lens demonstrate a peak gain of 24 dBi and 23 dBic for LP and CP radiation with an aperture of about  $7.5\,\,\lambda \times 7.5\,\,\lambda $  ( $\lambda $  is the free space wavelength at 30 GHz). The proposed lens features a wide gain bandwidth with dual polarization, low cost, and good radiation performance, which is well suited for mm-wave wireless applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3164217","Chengdu Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2019-YF08-00173-GX); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751401","3-D printed;dual-polarized antenna;f/D;gain bandwidth;metal lens;millimeter-wave (mm-wave)","Lenses;Metals;Antennas;Apertures;Three-dimensional displays;Dielectric losses;Costs","","17","","43","IEEE","7 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to the typical air-filled 2DLWA, where a perturbation of the first higher-order mode (TE1/TM1) results in highly directed broadside radiation, in the proposed antenna, the propagation and leakage of a quasi-TEM (Q-TEM) mode results in an extremely low-profile ( $0.065\lambda _{0}$ ), high-gain (~15 dBi) antenna. In this scenario, the transverse resonance condition for a Q-TEM mode is established by employing a capacitive partially reflective surface (PRS) in a thin ( $0.065\lambda _{0}$ ) substrate with a relative permittivity of 10.2. The proposed periodic 2DLWA, unlike the conventional uniform/quasi-uniform air-filled counterparts, radiates based on the  $\mathbf {n}=-\mathbf {1}$  space harmonic operation. Due to a strong mutual interaction between the PRS and ground plane, conventional design and analysis approaches are no longer relevant in this low-profile architecture. Instead, we employ the Floquet modal expansion theory to create an equivalent circuit model (ECM) for the PRS that takes into account the contributions and mutual interactions of the Floquet harmonics as well as the ground plane effect. By employing reflecting boundaries realized with edge truncation (air trenches) in a high permittivity substrate, we show that the aperture efficiency is enhanced by 15% compared to conventional counterpart.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3168271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762618","2-D leaky-wave antenna (2DLWA);EBG resonator antenna;Fabry–Perot cavity antenna (FPCA);Floquet modal expansion;high-gain antenna;low-profile antenna;optoelectronic integrated circuit (OEIC);partially reflective surface (PRS);PRS antenna;radio-over-fiber (RoF);resonant cavity antenna","Antennas;Permittivity;Substrates;Reflector antennas;Analytical models;Antenna radiation patterns;Transceivers","","10","","62","IEEE","25 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This antenna has a very simple structure, which is basically a grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW) printed on a specially shaped printed circuit board (PCB). Its working principle is that, for a GCPW with no ground vias (leaky GCPW), there will be a parallel plate waveguide (PPW) mode between its two ground layers, which couples with its GCPW mode. Because the GCPW mode has a phase velocity higher than that of the PPW mode, leaky-wave radiation will be generated from the GCPW to the PPW. This radiation is then radiated into the free space through a metal flare. Since the GCPW is nearly non-dispersive, the beam direction of this radiation is inherently not frequency scanning. Besides its simplicity, the proposed antenna has a pretty good performance. Measured results show a 3 dB realized gain bandwidth and −10 dB impedance bandwidth of larger than 26–40 GHz, a peak gain of 17.5 dBi, and a negligible beam scanning range of only 2.5° (±1.25°) across 26–40 GHz.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3168732","Chengdu Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2019-YF08-00173-GX); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762624","Fixed beam;grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW);leaky-wave antenna (LWA);printed antenna","Antennas;Substrates;Attenuation;Electric fields;Dispersion;Bandwidth;Coplanar waveguides","","6","","22","IEEE","25 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For those reasons, antennas providing a wide quasi-isotropic and circular polarization (CP) coverage are very attractive. However, achieving wide quasi-isotropic and CP coverage simultaneously is challenging. In this work, we show that properly designed sloped dipoles on a 3-D structure can maximize the CP coverage (theoretically up to 100%) even with equal-phased feed to the dipole elements. We derive the conditions and present the design graphs for the optimum slope angle for the dipole elements on a 3-D hexagonal-shaped package to achieve a wide quasi-isotropic and CP coverage simultaneously. Based on the proposed theory, a practical antenna has been designed and fabricated using additive manufacturing. The measured results demonstrate a 7 dB isotropy of 92% and a CP coverage of 85%, which matches well with the predicted results from the theoretical analysis and full-wave simulations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3168688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762601","Circularly polarized antenna;orientation-insensitive antenna;quasi-isotropic radiation pattern","Antenna radiation patterns;Dipole antennas;Mathematical models;Magnetic moments;Internet of Things;Three-dimensional displays;Antenna measurements","","14","","39","IEEE","25 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A methodology is proposed for impedance matching a piezocomposite strain antenna at the desired center frequency over the desired bandwidth via optimal choice of materials, volume fraction, and shape without the need for an external matching network. Furthermore, the radiation resistance for piezoelectric strain antennas is derived from Wheeler’s power factor and is shown to be much smaller than that of the similarly sized electric dipole antenna that was assumed in much of the literature.

The reductions of the antenna profiles and RCS are realized based on artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) surfaces and the phase cancellation, respectively. In the first design, two AMC surfaces are placed around the radiation patch and above the PRS. The thickness of the F-P cavity is reduced by half due to the zero-phase reflection of the lower AMC surface around the radiation patch. The income waves are partly reflected by the upper AMC surface above the PRS with zero reflection phase and partly penetrate the PRS and then reflected by the lower AMC surface also with zero reflection phase. The reflected EM waves from the bottom AMC surface travel another distance of quarter wavelength in the upward direction making the total electrical path traveled be half wavelength, thereby causing a phase shift of 180° with the reflected waves from the upper AMC surface, and thus resulting in a wideband RCS reduction. For the second design, another AMC surface is placed below the PRS. On one hand, the middle and lower AMC surfaces have the same reflection phases and then an F-P cavity with a subwavelength thickness is generated. On the other hand, the phase difference between the upper and lower AMC surfaces is also designed as 180°, which is used to suppress the total backward RCS. The two F-P antennas are both fabricated and measured. Measured results validate their reflection, radiation, and scattering performance well.

We find that the return loss and current distribution bandwidths of SFN are dominated by its input reactance slope. The ratio of SFN main line impedance Z0 and antenna impedance ZL plays an important role in it. When the optimal Z0/ZL makes the input reactance slope equal to zero at the center frequency, the bandwidth of SFN can be highly extended by 2–4 times compared with nonoptimal solutions. In this context, four classical types of SFNs are investigated and synthesized. The closed-form optimal formulas for these SFNs are further deduced under the specified element number N and current distributions I1,  $\text{I}_{2}, \ldots $ , and IN. For experimental verification, an eight-element series-fed antenna array driven by the SFN with Dolph–Chebyshev current distribution is designed and fabricated based on the proposed design method. By virtue of the improved SFN, the designed series-fed array exhibits enhanced impedance and radiation bandwidths as predicted.

Based on the proposed antenna subarray, a  $2\times $  2 dual-polarized 2-D multibeam DRA antenna array with simple structure is designed, fabricated, and measured, which can achieve high cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) in the direction of maximum radiation.

In massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) arrays, CS has been applied to reduce the number of measurements required to verify the arrays excitation. To date, the literature has concentrated on the various methods of achieving CS and applying them to both linear and 2-D arrays, and aimed at detecting fully failed elements in an array, offering simple pass/fail testing. All follow the general approach of creating the sparsity needed for CS by subtracting the measured far field or near field of the test array from that of a “gold standard” array measured under exactly identical conditions. This article extended this work to the need for rapid but accurate reconstruction of element excitation in a production testing environment for massive MIMO arrays. The aim is to demonstrate that CS can offer accurate reconstruction of array excitation. Particularly, the work addresses the issues of optimal sampling, measurement noise, accuracy of faulty element detection, effects of beam scanning, and physical alignment of the gold standard array with the test array. We have restricted ourselves to considering production standard arrays with failure rates up to around 5% and conclude with a set of proposed modifications to the basic CS process as applied to array excitations that achieve a near 20 dB improvement in the accuracy of the reconstructed array excitation offering mean square errors (MSEs) near to −40 dB, with a sampling strategy of just 1.4% of the Nyquist rate.

In this article, an approach to synthesize the optimal difference patterns for 3-D conformal arrays with asymmetric radiation aperture is proposed. To determine the limitation region of the main-lobe and sidelobe for a 3-D conformal array, an initial difference pattern is generated by the joint multidimensional vector clustering method. Then, an auxiliary phase function is introduced to convert the nonconvex constraint of the symmetry of the difference beam into a convex one. Finally, an iterative convex optimization is applied to obtain the optimal difference pattern.

The framework-based numerical analysis for a two-element-phased array shows that the addition of the canceler significantly increases the beam-equivalent noise temperature. For a two-element interferometer used in cosmology, this increase in noise temperature is still acceptable as the sky noise temperature in the 20-to-200 MHz band is high. When used in an interferometer, the canceler provides the ability to null mutual coherence at the interferometer output.

RFI can be suppressed using digital signal processing, but to improve dynamic range for wideband RFI, it can be desirable to remove interference in the analog domain before sampling. In previous work, it has been shown that analog true time delay (TTD) stages with a truncated Hadamard transform can place a wide-band spatial null on RFI from a given direction of arrival. We show that TTD and Hadamard projection is mathematically equivalent to a bank of classical narrow-band subspace projection beamformers, but with a structure that allows efficient implementation in either analog circuitry or digital hardware. We analyze how loss in the TTD blocks and time delay errors affect beamformer performance and propose methods for calibrating time delays. Simulation results show that ideal TTD and Hadamard projection matches the bank of subspace projection beamformers and places deep nulls over wideband RFI signals while achieving SNR performance comparable to the maximum signal-to-interference and -noise ratio beamformer.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3164884","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2030165,2030159); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9755070","Hadamard transforms;interference suppression;phased arrays;time delay arrays","Phased arrays;Array signal processing;Wideband;Interference;Transforms;Delay effects;Null space","","3","","12","IEEE","11 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work proposes a new fast full-wave strategy, with very low iteration times, based on the simultaneous use of addition theorems for spherical and cylindrical modes. After a domain decomposition of the array into fixed or modifiable (to be optimized) sections, each section is analyzed using a finite-element/modal analysis to obtain its general scattering matrix. Fixed sections are only once coupled at the beginning, while each optimization iteration is calculated with full-wave precision by adding the interactions with the modifiable sections. A complete design process of a novel 16-slot progressive-wave SIW-fed array is performed to validate the strategy usefulness. 112800 iterations, with 47 optimization variables, are calculated in under 4 h (speed-up factor of over 2000 compared to general-purpose commercial software).

The model is fundamentally based on the cascading of single-scattering events. In addition, the model is later extended to capture single-scattering blockage between backscattering events. The model is implemented using a Fresnel-integral-based method and validated by means of electromagnetic (EM) simulations and measurements. Furthermore, insight on the effects of the model parameters—number of surfaces, frequency, surface size, surface height-to-width ratio, surface displacement, and antenna-to-surface and surface-to-surface distances—is provided.

The proposed model is compared to ray tracing and used to elucidate the performance of (4, 4), (8, 8), and (16, 16) point-to-point MIMO systems. Indicatively, assuming 15 dBm of transmit power, a keep-out radius of  $R_{KO} \geq 50$  m, and a 24 satellite swarm, (16, 16) MIMO systems achieve approximately 4–5 times the capacity of a (2, 2) polarization diversity-based system, a significant improvement for a swarm that operates as a fractionated system and autonomously makes decisions. It is also shown that a (16, 1) single-input multiple-output system has 130 times the range of a (2, 1) system, increasing proportionally the lifetime of the swarm as satellites drift apart.

The measured human blockage loss is largest when the direct path (DP) in a line-of-sight (LOS) is blocked, but this loss is limited by other multipath components (MPCs). For nonline-of-sight (NLOS) channels, it is shown that human blockage loss is typically negligible. The presented measurement results show that human blockage loss in multipath channels is much smaller than that reported in diffraction- and measurement-based models, which neglect or minimize the contribution of all MPCs other than the DP.

In this article, we present an innovative approach of constructing a concise spherical harmonic-based anisotropic point scatterer model that the emulators can use as part of the computations. The point scatterer model is constructed directly from the precomputed RCS data. First, we use only the monostatic RCS data and compute the spherical harmonic-based monostatic point scatterer model by solving a linear least-squares problem which has a group sparsity constraint. Then, we further compute the spherical harmonic-based bistatic point scatterer model using the full bistatic RCS data. The problem is formulated as a bilinear least-squares problem. The problem is solved using the normalized iterative algorithm, which linearly solves two parameters in a back and forth manner.

The TR process accomplishes this by automatically focusing energy, both spatially and spectrally, on the stationary target. When scatterers are moving, however, the TR focusing can break down. This article shows how to modify the TR process so that it automatically focuses energy on a moving target. This new TR process automatically generates a distributed beam that: 1) follows the target as it moves and 2) enhances the target resonances by concentrating the energy spectrally. This focusing occurs without a priori knowledge of the target’s location or spectral response. The new TR algorithm is derived through a careful analysis of the idealized case of a single isotropic moving point scatterer. This article includes simulations that compare the TR focus both with and without the new modification. Although the simulations are carried out for the electromagnetic case, the theory applies equally well to the acoustic case when the target speed is significantly less than the ambient sound speed. Appendices are included with details of the calculations and with analysis of the range of relative velocities for which the modified TR process should be used.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3190095","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-18-1-0087,FA9550-21-1-0169); Post 9/11 GI Bill; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832531","Distributed sensors;doppler correction;eigenvalues;inverse scattering;multiple input multiple output;power method;target motion;target tracking;time reversal (TR);TR mirror","Sensors;Focusing;Scattering;Doppler effect;Frequency-domain analysis;Iterative methods;Sensor arrays","","3","","30","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sensitivity is maintained by tightly bounded the magnetic field in the cross Section of the transmission line through loading the high dielectric material. The accuracy is naturally improved by the uniform field distributed along the propagation direction.

To assess the significance of Rxs, its performance was compared to the well-known circular planar (Rxf), half-sphere-shaped (Rxhs), and solenoid (Rsl) coils. Moreover, a small and efficient voltage doubler as a rectifier was designed. This voltage doubler has a high conversion efficiency of 89% with an output voltage of >3 V at 15 dBm. To validate the concept, prototypes of the coils and voltage doubler were fabricated and measured in saline and minced pork. The PTEs of the Rxf, Rxhs, Rsl, and Rxs coils-based WPT systems were studied under different lateral and angular misalignments in both simulations and measurements. In perfect alignment conditions, the measured PTEs of Rxf, Rxhs, Rsl, and Rxs WPT systems were 7.68%, 10.18%, 25.01%, and 22.38%, respectively; however, when the (Rx) receiver coils rotated by 90°, the PTEs were 0%, < 0.2%, 0.15%, and 5.4%, respectively. Under lateral misalignments of  $dx =25$  mm, the PTEs were 0.82%, 1.91%, 2.4%, and 4.87%, respectively. Furthermore, the PTE for the Rxs-based WPT system was measured in saline- and minced-pork-filled boxes and a saline-filled American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) model under different misalignment conditions to expand its applicability range to deep-body non-static implants.

In this work, we propose a new RCS calibrator, the metal ellipsoidal cylinder (EC), whose RCS characteristics are similar to a metal sphere, while it can be mounted on a metal pylon with little electromagnetic (EM) interactions as a CC does. A high-frequency RCS expression is derived using geometrical optics (GO) for the new calibrator. The scattering mechanisms are analyzed to establish the accurate parametric representation of the theoretical RCS. Based on surface current analysis and numerical calculation, the calibrator-pylon interaction (CPI), the angular sensitivity, and the bistatic RCS characteristics are discussed, enabling the calibration uncertainty evaluation for applying the proposed calibrator in the ground-plane range (GPR).

Each sub-beam illuminates a small region of the rough surface, and the impedance matrix is remarkably reduced small enough for fast full-wave electromagnetic (EM) scattering computation. The edge energy suppression of the sub-beam enables each sub-block to be calculated independently and parallelly. The PSF convolution kernel is derived to generate the ISAR image fast with the induced current at a central frequency and central incident angle. The numerical simulation demonstrates that the proposed BSM-PSF image simulation method remarkably reduces the unknowns of each method of moment (MoM) equation and avoids redundant matrix solutions for sweep frequencies and angles while keeping the correlation with the traditional fast Fourier transform (FFT) method over 0.9.

To estimate this quantity while having the possibility of stretching the sample under test, a waveguide-based non-contact approach is proposed. The absence of contact between the sample under test and the waveguides determines an electromagnetic field leakage, which is prevented by adopting an electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structure. The surface impedance of the sample is retrieved through an inversion procedure exploiting the scattering parameters measured using the proposed setup. The inversion procedure is based on a circuit representation of the waveguide-air-waveguide Section as a  $\pi $ -junction. The reliability of the proposed measurement method has been experimentally assessed using a WR137 waveguide.

The challenges are field distortion and backscattering by the probe, spatial resolution, sensitivity, isotropy, and phase accuracy. In addition, the surfaces of the device may not be planar. Today, methods based on phaseless amplitude measurements are widely applied using plane-to-plane phase reconstruction (PR) to obtain the field phasors. The obtained phasors in conjunction with Maxwell’s equations allow to evaluate the fields in the whole volume of interest. Although these methods meet the PD compliance criteria for flat surfaces at distances as close as  $\lambda /5$ , they are unsuited for curved surfaces and closer distances. To overcome these limitations, we present a method based on a multiple-multipole expansion for accurate PD evaluation in all field regions using sparse phaseless electric field measurements. We construct a physically relevant vectorial basis in terms of elementary electric or magnetic dipoles and optimize their amplitudes such that the measured fields are reproduced with minimal error. The proposed procedure yields current distributions that resemble the physical radiation source and accurately reconstruct the electromagnetic field from the (reactive) near-field to the far-field regions with an uncertainty of <0.6 dB. Our approach does not pose any geometric requirements to the measurement or evaluation surfaces and thus supports conformal assessments, providing a potential solution for accurate PD evaluation of 5G devices and beyond.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785441","Antenna characterization;electromagnetic (EM) simulation;exposure assessment;field integral equations;millimeter-wave antennas;multiple-multipole (MMP) method","Antenna measurements;Phase measurement;Magnetic field measurement;Mathematical models;Optical surface waves;Linear antenna arrays;Density measurement","","11","","39","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sensor (13 cm2 in size) comprises a radial pattern of grooves that support spoof localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes and a ground plane with a complementary window that controls the sensor’s interaction with the body. These spoof LSP modes provide a sharp resonant dip and a broadly tunable evanescent field that enables tracking of heartbeat and respiration via the  $|S_{11}|$  spectrum measured in a connector-free manner. We establish the optimal operating mode of the sensor and show that it provides a resonant frequency shift of 250 MHz for respiration and 100 MHz for heartbeat motions.

In terms of scattering performance, broadband RCS reduction is achieved by using a hybrid RCS reduction technique that combines two destructive interference principles. The  $\vert \text{S}_{11}\vert < -10$  dB bandwidth reaches 53.2%, the AR < 3 dB bandwidth reaches 50%, and the RCS reduction bandwidth reaches 147.8% for a low-profile structure with a relatively low number of MS unit cells.

The center-fed circular patch antenna is utilized as the driven element for the vertically polarized (VP) radiation. The annular quasi-dipole array fed by the one-to-four power divider produces horizontally polarized (HP) radiation. Simultaneously, it also acts as the VP director to improve VP gain and bandwidth. Besides, the two annular strips enhance the HP omni-directivity and gain. In this way, the VP and HP share the same aperture to improve the profile utilization rate effectively. Due to the symmetry of the basic antenna structure, stable DP donut patterns are obtained within the entire operating bandwidth.

We first reformulate the robust synthesis method based on the worst-case performance criterion as a perturbation of the direct synthesis method. Then we prove that the direct and robust synthesis methods have the same solution up to a scaling factor. Thus, they produce the same array pattern (normalized). The condition for this result is that the error norms of steering vectors in different directions are equal to a small positive number, which is a reasonable assumption in practice.

In addition, the ghosting image caused by the multipath effect can be well displayed in the simulated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3164925","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0202500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771052); Shanghai Aerospace Science and Technology Innovation Fund(grant numbers:2020-005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9777874","Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF);composite scattering;four-path model (FPM);scattering center (SC);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Scattering;Couplings;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;Numerical models;Dielectrics;Sea surface","","14","","21","IEEE","18 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Contrast-Source Electromagnetic Imaging Scheme Based on Projected Nonlinear Landweber–Kaczmar","A.

The CS data and state misfits are cast to form a multi-cost problem. The framework implements a nonlinear Landweber–Kaczmarz (LWKZ) algorithm that conveys the multi-cost minimization. The iteration step lengths associated with the cost terms are updated based on the maximum eigenvalues of the cost terms’ Jacobian matrices. Unlike in other CS schemes, preconditioning is not required in the proposed CS-based LWKZ (CSLWKZ), as the eigenvalues balance the cost terms through each iteration step. Furthermore, an efficient approach to calculate the eigenvalues is outlined, which significantly reduces the CSLWKZ computations. At the end of the CSLWKZ scheme, a first-norm projection operator is enforced on the contrast vector to achieve sparseness. Numerical results of a range of validity tests and a comparison with three other CS frameworks demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. In addition, experimental results based on the Fresnel Institute database are illustrated.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743606","Contrast-source (CS) formulation;electromagnetic imaging (EMI);nonlinear optimization;sparse regularization","Costs;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Transmitters;Jacobian matrices;Electromagnetic interference;Optimization;Mathematical models","","5","","21","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It leverages on the measurements-by-design (MebD) paradigm, and it exploits some a priori information on the antenna under test (AUT) to generate an overcomplete representation basis. Accordingly, the problem at hand is reformulated in a compressive sensing (CS) framework as the retrieval of a maximally sparse distribution (with respect to the overcomplete basis) from a reduced set of measured data, and then, it is solved by means of a Bayesian strategy. Representative numerical results are presented to, also comparatively, assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the “burden/cost” of the acquisition process and mitigate (possible) truncation errors when dealing with space-constrained probing systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177528","Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research within the Program PRIN 2017(grant numbers:CUP: E64I19002530001); Project EMvisioning(grant numbers:2017HZJXSZ); Program “Smart cities and communities and Social Innovation”(grant numbers:CUP: E44G14000040008); Project “SMARTOUR”(grant numbers:SCN_00166); Program PON R&I 2014-2020 for the Project “MIT-IGO”(grant numbers:ARS01_00964); “Dipartimenti di Eccellenza (2018-2022)”.
