However, the conventional methodology to design multiband dipole antennas is generally empirically based. More frequency bands usually mean even more arms/slots, which results in increasingly bulky size. In this article, we introduce an algorithm to use the fewest arms to design any multiband linear dipole antenna. The algorithm is based on sharing arms after the effective ranges of mode excitation are determined by characteristic mode analysis (CMA). It also applies to multiple wideband or ultrawideband antennas. By this algorithm, an exemplified pentaband dipole antenna is designed, effectively covering 433, 868, 1176, 1575, and 2450 MHz bands for low-power wide-area network (LPWAN), global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) applications. The antenna has only 2.5 pairs of arms. 50% of arms are reduced in comparison to traditional methods. This algorithm significantly simplifies the structure of a multiband dipole antenna, especially suitable for strip- or bar-shaped IoT devices.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3138805","Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, SAR, China(grant numbers:CRF CityU C1020-19E); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071408); CityU Strategic Research Grant(grant numbers:SRG-Fd 7005227); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9670686","Global positioning system (GPS);Internet of Things (IoT);low-power wide-area network (LPWAN);smart glasses;smart pencil;smart wristband;theory of characteristic mode (TCM);wireless smart device","Dipole antennas;Resonant frequency;Internet of Things;Couplings;Antenna theory;Wires;Smart glasses","","3","","36","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We report an active transmitting XESA whose gain-bandwidth product (GBWP) exceeds the passive Bode-Fano upper bound. It is realized by incorporating a highly efficient, electrically small, near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) antenna into the feedback loop of an operational amplifier (OpAmp). Rather than a cascaded configuration, the innovative structural embedding of the NFRP antenna directly with the OpAmp circuit significantly increases its effective gain without consuming any additional real estate. The operating mechanisms of the integrated system are explained with an equivalent circuit model. An optimized prototype was fabricated, assembled, and tested. The electrical size of its radiating element is extremely small with ka = 0.15 at 414 MHz, i.e.,  $a~\approx \lambda $ /42. The measured results of this active XESA, in good agreement with their simulated values, demonstrate that its effective gain can be dynamically tuned within a 6.01 dB range. The measured maximum effective gain and, hence, the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) witnesses a 9.152 dB (8.23 times) improvement in comparison to its passive counterpart and its measured GBWP surpasses the corresponding passive Bode-Fano upper bound by approximately 15.2 times.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137215","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001065,62031006); Chongqing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:cstc2019jcyjjqX0004); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP160102219); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664444","Active antennas;amplifiers;electrically small antennas (ESAs);feedback;gain;near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) elements;operational amplifiers (OpAmps)","Gain;Impedance;Antenna measurements;Antennas;Antenna feeds;Wireless communication;Resistors","","3","","64","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to eliminate the risk of mechanical rotation failure, an antenna design with no moving parts that achieve the conical beam sweep is desirable. In this article, a lightweight, 3-D-printed, inhomogeneous lens antenna is presented as an all-electronic alternative. Compared to the previous on-axis fed lenses, the real-life application requiring conical scanning necessitates significant developments regarding the synthesis, optimization, and prototyping of the off-axis fed lens. The lens antenna is designed using curved-ray geometrical optics coupled to particle swarm optimization to determine the optimum lens surface shapes and material inhomogeneity while obtaining a design with minimum volume and therefore mass. An 18 cm lens is designed using this approach. Instructions on how to 3-D-print the inhomogeneous lens are given using a unit cell design, which permits additive manufacturing using fused deposition modeling (FDM) techniques. The lens is measured for far-field pattern performance at various locations along with the ring-shaped focus of the azimuthally symmetric lens. The measurements agree well with predictions obtained by full-wave simulations.

The technique enhances the applicability of the full-wave Green’s function in the evaluation of input impedance and radiation characteristics for an antenna structure with imperfectly conducting spherical surface, which to the best of our knowledge has not been reported before in the DRA literature. The role of the surface impedance on the antenna resonance and quality factor is thoroughly characterized.

In this article, a high-gain multilens-horn antenna system is presented. The antenna system provides highly effective isotropic radiated power by using only a few high-gain antenna elements, where each element only needs a low transmit power of 26 dBm to reach users at far distances. Moreover, due to channel reciprocity, both down- and uplink benefit from an increased antenna gain. It is shown that a reasonable number of high-gain antennas can provide coverage in a 60° sector with an inter-site distance of 300 m. Based on radio-planning simulations, three horn shapes are identified to provide sufficient coverage. The final optimized dual-polarized multilens-horn design is fabricated and experimentally verified. With a low transmit power at the base station (BS) of 26 dBm, a signal strength of at least −65 dBm is achieved in 98.9% of the sector at 28 GHz under non-line-of-sight conditions for the vertical polarization.

A fully aperture-shared dual-band antenna consisting of a low-band antenna (LBA) and a high-band antenna (HBA) right below the LBA is first investigated. The aperture sharing has little influence on the LBA but causes a severe shielding effect on the HBA. To alleviate the shielding effect, a low-pass PRS is inserted between the LBA and HBA, forming an air-filled quasi-Fabry–Perot cavity, which can make compensation for the radiation from the HBA but with little influence on the LBA. The second PRS is introduced above the LBA to enhance the bandwidth (BW) for HBA. It is shown that the fully aperture-shared dual-band antenna achieves an impedance BW ( $\vert \text{S}11\vert < -15$  dB) of ~43.7% (0.68–1.07 GHz) for the LBA and ~45% (1.7–2.7 GHz) for the HBA with an average gain of ~8 dBi and stable radiation patterns. Based on the PRSs, an aperture-shared dual-band antenna subarray is finally developed for base-station applications, which covers the frequency bands of 0.68–0.96 and 1.7–2.7 GHz for 2G/3G/4G mobile communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137448","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071185,61871194); Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515011410); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Short-Range Wireless Detection and Communication(grant numbers:2017B030314003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666043","Base station;broadband antenna;dual-band antenna;partially reflecting surface (PRS)","Surface impedance;Mutual coupling;Dual band;Mobile antennas;Reflector antennas;Aperture antennas;Reflection","","43","","26","IEEE","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To verify the design concept, a multifunctional pattern reconfigurable metamaterial-inspired antenna with a low profile of  $0.05~\lambda _{0}$  is fabricated and measured. The measured overlapping bandwidth for the eight radiation modes is 3.10–3.85 GHz (21.6%), well covering the 5G-N78 band. The port isolation between the two polarizations in eight modes is higher than 20 dB. The proposed reconfigurable metamaterial-inspired antenna shows the merits of low profile, wide bandwidth, high port isolation, low cost, multifunctional pattern reconfigurable capability, and easy fabrication for 5G and other sub-6 GHz applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137445","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171091); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9665232","Low-profile;metamaterial;miniaturization;multifunctional antenna;pattern reconfigurable antenna;periodic capacitor-loaded surface","Antenna radiation patterns;Slot antennas;Metasurfaces;Switches;Capacitors;Broadband antennas;Antennas","","16","","33","IEEE","29 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Transformation-Optics-Based Flat Metamaterial Luneburg Lens Antenna With Zero Focal Length","R. Xu; Z. N.

However, it is found that the focus is usually not located on the surface of the transformed LL anymore after applying TO. The focus location shift results in a limited volume reduction, severe reflection from the new lens surface, and limited scanning range with increased spillover loss. This article theoretically studies and proposes a TO-based LL antenna with zero focal length by considering the phase mismatch caused by space discontinuity. The study first reveals that the transformation of an LL alone without sustaining the original boundary inherently deteriorates the original focusing property even before exerting any approximation. To validate the idea, a flat metamaterial LL antenna using TO is proposed, approximated, and fabricated using an integrated dielectric and conductive 3-D printing manufacturing process. The feeding patch antenna remains on the surface of the transformed lens. The thickness of the proposed antenna is reduced to 1/3 of a traditional LL in its boresight, while a ±20° beam scanning range is achieved with linearly shifted feedings. The study verifies that it is essential to ensure phase matching at the radiation boundary to maintain the original focusing property of an LL. The information derived from the study evidences the conditions of the enforcement of TO in electromagnetic problems such as dielectric lenses.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682537","Beamforming;beamsteering;lens antennas;lens focus;Luneburg lens (LL);transformation optics","Lenses;Focusing;Surface waves;Optical surface waves;Antennas;Slabs;Permittivity","","28","","50","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

That is, the HM patch would serve as a part of the BPF, as well as a radiator. This design method of implementing the filtering antenna is verified by a newly developed prototype. The physical model is realized in a simple form of a patch antenna fed by differential coupled lines. A microstrip-to-slotline transition is implemented to excite the coupled lines. Two radiation nulls beside the passband are obtained, thereby leading to a sharp band skirt. Based on this filtering antenna, a two-element patch array is designed. A CPW-to-slotline transition is designed to excite the united coupling lines, which serves as both a balun and a power divider. A high out-of-band rejection level within a wide stopband is achieved. For demonstration, the proposed filtering antenna and array are fabricated and measured. Reasonable agreement between the measured and simulated results is observed.

Innovative antenna solutions are needed to relieve the higher free space attenuation at these frequencies. Here, we propose a multibeam antenna based on a geodesic lens with stable aggregate gain characteristics in the far-field. An analytical model based on the physical path of the rays inside the lens is applied to achieve the field distribution in the aperture of the lens. This method is used to find the profile of a near-field focusing lens with a widened beam in the far-field. As a proof of concept, a seven-beam antenna has been designed. Due to the rotational symmetry of the geodesic lens, the antenna beams present similar characteristics over an extended sectorial coverage. The lens antenna has been manufactured, and its near-field focusing features were validated. The prototype has been assessed also in the far-field with a good agreement between model, simulations, and measurements. The main novelty of this prototype is to achieve a multiple beam coverage within  $\pm 67^\circ $  in the H-plane and  $\pm 20^\circ $  in the E-plane, with a gain roll-off smaller than 2 dB at 30 GHz and smaller than 3 dB at 35 GHz.

In this article, a novel architecture for an all-metal RLSA is proposed by replacing the dielectric material with a regular bed of metallic nails, thus maintaining the required slow wave characteristic within the radial waveguide. The slot array is efficiently optimized by using an ad hoc method-of-moments solver, based on the definition of an equivalent problem in the waveguide region. This accurate optimization process, along with the all-metal nature of the antenna, allows to reach a measured peak total efficiency above 80% at 30 GHz. The fabricated prototype consists of two pieces: the bottom waveguide with the bed of nails and the top slotted plate, which are easily assembled by means of a few screws.

First, the schematic of a dual-band array with its beamwidth regulation capability is presented. Then, two key components, i.e., a novel dual-band patch antenna element and a compact filtering phase shifter (FPS) are developed. The antenna element has counterintuitive beam patterns with broad azimuthal half-power beamwidth (HPBW) of 183.3° in the lower band but much narrower azimuthal HPBW of 68.5° in the upper band, indicating its excellent ability in beamwidth regulation with a figure of merit (FoM) of 2.31. Meanwhile, the FPS serves as a band-stop filter in the lower band and a phase shifter in the upper band. Furthermore, a two-element series-fed subarray is designed by cascading two properly designed antenna elements through the FPS. Finally, a parallel-series-fed array consisting of four rows of the series-fed subarrays is implemented, and a prototype is fabricated and tested. The measured results, in good agreement with the simulated ones, have demonstrated that the array satisfactorily attains a broad fan beam with azimuthal HPBW of 156° and gain of 11.05 dBi at 5 GHz and a narrow pencil beam with azimuthal HPBW of 30° and gain of 16.23 dBi at 5.8 GHz under a shared aperture of  $1.37\lambda _{0} \times 3.53\lambda _{0} \times 0.05\lambda _{0}$ , indicating an enhanced FoM up to 4.48.

In this work, two techniques are developed to reduce the in-band scattering of Vivaldi antenna arrays. First, a novel Vivaldi antenna element with an inherent low scattering level is proposed based on the extraction of the scattering and radiating currents. Second, a chessboard artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) surface with a 180° reflection phase difference is developed to cancel out the scattering caused by the antenna array.

An optimization model is proposed for the SBPS problem to minimize the peak sidelobe level by jointly optimizing the subarray configuration and element excitations/positions. A typical advantage of the proposed model is to reduce the system control points while maintaining the benign array performance. However, the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex one, which makes it challenging. Besides, this problem cannot be directly solved due to the existence of coupling optimization variables. Thus, a set of auxiliary variables is introduced to move the coupling optimization variables into equality constraints.

To alleviate the resource consumption of wideband array beamforming, we propose a novel time-domain wideband digital beamformer that can control the beam shape over the whole bandwidth for interference mitigation by using only one set of amplitude–phase weights and integer time delay filters. To tackle the resultant optimization problem, two effective algorithms are introduced, and both can solve the problem within polynomial time. One is an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes the original problem into multiple tractable subproblems iteratively. The other is the convex approximation algorithm that transforms the original problem into a series of second-order cone programming problems iteratively. The two algorithms exhibit their respective advantages in terms of convergence and computational complexity. Extensive numerical examples are presented to evaluate the proposed time-domain wideband beamforming strategy, highlighting that it can form a deep notch in any interested spatial–spectral region to suppress the strong interferences.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137460","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771109,U19B2017,62101097,61871080,61701088); Changjiang Scholar Program; Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2019JDJQ0014); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B17008); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M680147,2021T140096); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9665263","Alternating optimization (AO) algorithm;convex approximation (CA) algorithm;interference nulling;nonconvex optimization;wideband digital beamformer (DBF)","Wideband;Optimization;Array signal processing;Approximation algorithms;White noise;Time-domain analysis;Time-frequency analysis","","8","","42","IEEE","29 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In lieu of the traditional fields and potentials, this article presents new formulations that introduce from the outset the concept and utilization of field-impulses for the fundamental equations of electromagnetics. Unlike the potentials that may or may not be real or causal depending on the gauge, the field-impulses as physical field-integrators (time-integrals) are like fields being physically real, causal, and gauge-independent. Furthermore, the single electric field-impulse/integrator alone through its second-order (wave) equation is capable of aptly describing electromagnetics in all cases of electrostatics, magnetostatics, and electrodynamics. Upon close scrutiny and comparison, the optional static–dynamic decomposition of electric field-impulse can be related to the potentials with source-incorporated gauge condition. Such source-incorporated condition is unlike other popular gauge conditions that are source-free or incorporating the source implicitly. The electric field-impulse as physical field-integrator is necessary and sufficient for many aspects of electromagnetics including field derivation, Lorentz force, momentum, interaction energy, quantum particle–electromagnetic interactions, etc.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9665271","Electromagnetic theory;field-impulse;field-integrator;gauge condition;scalar potential;vector potential","Electromagnetics;Electric potential;Media;Toroidal magnetic fields;Mathematical models;Electromagnetic scattering;Magnetostatics","","4","","51","IEEE","29 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These field transformations are governed by the generalized sheet transition conditions, which relate the tangential fields on each side of the surface through the surface parameters. Ideally, designers would solve for the surface parameters based on their application-specific far-field criteria. However, determining the surface parameters for these criteria is challenging without knowledge of the tangential fields on each side of the surface, which are not unique for a given far-field pattern. Current designs are generally restricted to analytical examples where the tangential fields can be solved for, or determined via ad hoc methods, although there has been recent work to circumvent this. This article presents an optimization scheme, which determines surface parameters, such as electric impedance, magnetic admittance, and magnetoelectric coupling, satisfying far-field constraints, such as beam level, sidelobe level, and null locations. The optimization is performed using a method of moments-based model incorporating edge effects and mutual coupling. The surface parameters are optimized for using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Examples of this optimization scheme performing multicriteria pattern forming, extreme angle small surface refraction, and Chebyshev-like beamforming are presented.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137272","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664469","Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs);electric field integral equation;electromagnetic metasurface (EMMS);metasurface;method of moments (MoMs);optimization;synthesis","Surface impedance;Method of moments;Magnetoelectric effects;Metasurfaces;Surface reconstruction;Optimization;Couplings","","39","","30","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We further smooth the integral by removing the static form of the kernel and evaluating it separately using a semi-analytical approach.

Therefore, methods with wavelength or subwavelength resolution are required for the mixed boundary ISP. In this article, we devise a quantitative inversion scheme alternately updating the contrast of dielectric scatterers and the T-matrix of conducting scatterers. The proposed alternate parameter updating method (APUM) avoids the reconstruction deterioration from both the large imaginary parts of conducting contrasts and the limited expansion order of the T-matrix. Then, we further improve the resolution of the APUM by optimizing the incident fields, which is also a regularization strategy. In particular, we design superoscillatory incident fields to quantitatively converse the high spatial spectrum of objects into low spectrum contrast sources, which can retain the high-frequency information of objects in the low-passband of the Green function.

The first scheme was the conventional GPR comprising one transmitter and one receiver. The second scheme comprises two transmitters and one receiver, which the transmitters were excited by out-of-phase generators with each other. The simulations were initially performed using the three-antenna system for GPR. The results indicated that the natural poles in the scattering responses changed according to the characteristics of the object. For comparison, the three-antenna system for GPR was fabricated and experimented in comparison with the conventional GPR configuration. The experimental results revealed that the three-antenna configuration was able to mitigate the ground bounce and antenna coupling effects, while the conventional GPR was interfered by the effect of ground reflection and mutual coupling of the antennas. The three-antenna configuration is thus suitable to be the front-end before extracting the natural poles. In addition, the frequency domain method is compatible with the three-antenna system in the determination of the natural poles for identification.

This algorithm aims to reduce the number of rays that must be traced with time-consuming ray–triangle intersection tests. In order to achieve this, the target’s electrical length is reduced to a predefined value in each aspect angle. Then, only rays that hit the scaled target is traced without changing the analysis frequency. The RCS values for full-scaled model are estimated by using the ray displacements and field strengths calculated for the scaled model. This algorithm yields a significant decrease in the computational burden with a trade-off between analysis accuracy and time consumption. Analysis results show that the introduced algorithm and original SBR give very similar RCS results except at very low RCS points as depicted in the RCS versus aspect angle graphs. In addition, using a fixed frequency makes the algorithm applicable to not only perfectly electrical conducting (PEC) targets, but also targets coated with radar absorbing materials (RAMs).","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664488","Radar absorbing materials (RAMs);radar cross section (RCS);shooting and bouncing rays (SBRs);target scaling","Electron tubes;Solid modeling;Frequency measurement;Apertures;Shape;Computational modeling;Time-frequency analysis","","10","","27","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To enable phase-coherent distributed operation between separate wireless nodes, the oscillators in the transceivers must operate at the same frequency, and their phases must be appropriately aligned to support beamsteering. Based on a spectrally sparse waveform, a self-mixing frequency demodulation circuit, and an adaptive control loop, we present a system capable of synchronizing the RF oscillators in separate transceivers over distances of 90 m. The approach is based on a multitone waveform designed for joint internode ranging and frequency transfer. A frequency reference is modulated onto one signal of a two-tone waveform transmitted by the primary node and is then demodulated and used to lock the oscillator of the secondary node. The secondary node retransmits the two-tone signal, which the primary node uses for a high-accuracy range measurement. From this range, the phase of the two transceivers can be aligned to support beamforming. We furthermore implemented an adaptive phase control approach to support high-accuracy phase coordination in changing environmental conditions.

It is necessary because the initial designs rendered through topology evolution, parameter sweeping, or theoretical models are often of poor quality and need to be improved to satisfy stringent performance requirements. Given multiple objectives, constraints, and a typically large number of geometry parameters, the design closure should be carried out through numerical optimization. Unfortunately, standard algorithms entail high CPU expenses and are prone to failure. Feature-based optimization (FBO) is one of the methods developed to alleviate these difficulties by reformulating the design task in terms of the characteristic points extracted from EM-simulated responses. FBO capitalizes on a less nonlinear relationship between the feature point coordinates and antenna dimensions as compared to the original responses (e.g., frequency characteristics). This leads to flattening the functional landscape to be handled, faster convergence of the optimization algorithms, and a possibility of mitigating the issues pertinent to multimodality. Notwithstanding, the response features have to be individually defined for each type of antenna response and tailored to a particular type of design specifications. This requires user experience and hinders the widespread application of FBO. This article proposes a generalized and unified feature point definition, which is suitable for the majority of typical antenna input characteristics (narrowband, multiband, enhanced bandwidth, and wideband) and performance specifications (matching improvement, bandwidth enhancement, and a mixture thereof). Our framework allows for an automated definition of the feature points given the performance specifications, along with their extraction from EM-simulated responses. The operation of the framework is illustrated using a range of planar antennas and favorably compared to conventional (nonfeature-based) design closure task formulation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137405","Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)(grant numbers:217771); Gda´nsk University of Technology under the Argentum Triggering Research Grants Program–“Excellence Initiative-Research University”(grant numbers:DEC-41/2020/IDUB/I.3.3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9665246","Antenna design;computer-aided design;electromagnetic (EM)-driven design;optimization;parameter tuning;response features","Optimization;Antennas;Broadband antennas;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Resonant frequency","","33","","69","IEEE","29 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Tissue-matched dielectric loading of the array improves the radiation efficiency and ensures quasi tissue-independent operation for both bands.

The realized gains are −28.9 and −18.6 dBi at 434 MHz and 2.45 GHz, respectively, when the array is placed in the center of a ø100-mm diameter spherical phantom with muscle-equivalent properties. Using a single switch, the array can be reconfigured to adjust the angular position of the nulls in the radiation pattern in both bands thereby enabling synthesis of an effectively null-free omnidirectional pattern.

Our study determines the minimum required samples and provides a validation tool to assess the ability of a sampling scheme to recover the antenna characteristics by the measured data. Furthermore, an optimum sampling scheme is proposed by clustering the energy of vector spherical harmonics using the frame theory without any time-consuming iterative, which leads to a highly efficient SNF measurement procedure. The number of samples determined by the proposed method is only 50% of the Nyquist method, which provides significant advantages for storage and processing time. Our method additionally shows a great promise for the recovery of the far-field radiation pattern from near-field samples with the same performance as the Nyquist sampling on a sphere.

This system adopts the angle-of-arrival (AoA) positioning approach that is conventionally applied to the region where plane waves dominate the propagation. Hence, to ensure the effectiveness of the AoA approach when it is working in close proximity to the human body, a new algorithm is proposed to transfer the antenna’s radiation pattern from the far-field to the detection region where spherical waves can still be observed. This AoA-based MCD system requires fewer antennas than other radar-based positioning approaches, thereby creating a low-profile hardware architecture. In addition, during the detection process, a differential technique is incorporated in order to track the signal change due to the administration of contrast agents, which can significantly suppress the noise inside the biological medium. The AoA-based differential MCD system is numerically studied on an anatomically realistic breast phantom subject to a variety of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The results show that the proposed system can successfully locate the tumor with an average resolution of 0.6 mm. When the SNR in the biological medium is 10 dB, the average positioning error is less than 1.5 mm with sensitivity maintained above 60%, which surpasses the performance of other similar systems. The system is also experimentally validated with a physical breast phantom and stepper-motor-driven rotating antennas, where the reconstructed image shows a minor deviation of 3.61 mm with that of the simulated one.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3137226","National Science Challenges of New Zealand(grant numbers:UOWX1901); Sichuan Science and Technology Program of China(grant numbers:2021JDRC0036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664473","Angle-of-arrival (AoA) approach;contrast-enhanced microwave cancer detection (MCD);differential detection;tumor detection and localization","Manganese;Receiving antennas;Tumors;Antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna measurements;Phantoms","","10","","30","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A meshed-like-structure is designed, which works as the radiator of a microstrip antenna at UHF band. However, it works as a partial reflective sheet for a Fabry–Perot resonator cavity antenna at C-band. Therefore, a microstrip patch antenna and a Fabry–Perot resonator cavity antenna share only single aperture. A shaped ground is used to decrease the resonance at the lower band.

The antenna is denoted as symmetrically stacked planar antenna (SSPA), which utilizes the phase difference between the top and bottom patches to enable dual-linear/circular polarized hemispheric radiation. This communication focuses on the dual-linear polarized aspect. One polarization is achieved when a 180° phase difference exists between the first-set of ports, while the perpendicular polarization is accomplished when the second-set of ports are in-phase. A four-element array is constructed to exemplify this concept at 28 GHz, and the main beam is steered across the sphere. A comparison with other designs reported in the literature is conducted to highlight the salient points of the proposed methodology regarding planar, dual-polarized, and lumped-components-free features.

The TEmn mode in the DP resonator is theoretically analyzed to provide guidance for the subsequent antenna design. The high-order TE12 mode that can be differentially excited is selected as the operating mode to further enhance the gain. Based on this, three parallel coupling slots loaded with p-i-n diodes are used as a beam steering structure. By controlling the ON-/OFF-state of the p-i-n diodes to change the  $E$ -field distribution of the TE12 mode, the main beam can be switched to five directions. The measured gain of each state is higher than 7 dBi, and the peak value reaches 8.1 dBi. The beam steering structure and differential-fed scheme show good coordination, which effectively suppresses the deterioration of cross-polarization caused by structural asymmetry. The cross-polarization of each state is lower than −26 dB. To further verify the scalability of the proposed ideal, a 1  $\times $  4 array fed by two dual Marchand baluns is implemented, which well maintains the beam steering capability and low cross-polarization.

And then a taper and double-sided SSPPs TL are used to transform the resonant mode in the dipole antenna to the SSPPs mode and achieve impedance and momentum matching. The high transmission performance of the SSPPs TL is obtained by etching a series of periodically corrugated grooves on the metal strip in the top layer and a ground pad connected to the convexity of the rectangular waveguide is employed in the bottom layer. A back-to-back transition prototype was fabricated on a  $50~\mu \text{m}$ -thickness quartz substrate and designed for a terahertz device with WR-4.3 standard rectangular waveguide.
