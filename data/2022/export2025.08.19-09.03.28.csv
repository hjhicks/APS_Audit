After the dielectric scatterer’s relative permittivity and the incident field are input into the network, the total field is trained to converge to the ground truth iteratively. In the neural network, Green’s function is taken as an explicit operator to describe wave physics, and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is applied to accelerate the computation of volume integrations. The global influence of all points in the space is compressed into a layer by the volume integration. In numerical tests, we validate the accuracy, efficiency, and generalization ability of the proposed neural network, and investigate the feasibility of changing the input size and the frequency in the prediction.

The conventional methods for PD-ISPs can be categorized into single-step methods and two-step methods, where the first ones directly reconstruct the image and the second ones retrieve the phase and amplitude of scattered fields, and then reconstruct the image as the traditional FD-ISPs. However, the single-step methods correspond to solve higher nonlinear optimization problems and the two-step methods highly depend on the quality of the retrieved phase and amplitude information. To solve the above issues, we propose a two-step method with a cascaded complex U-net (CCU-net) model to solve the PD-ISPs in the complex domain. The CCU-net consists of two parts, that is, Phase Retrieval Net (PRNet) and Image Reconstruction Net (IRNet), where the PRNet recovers the phase and amplitude of the scattered field from the measured modulus of the total field and the IRNet takes the recovered scattered field as input to reconstruct the image. These two parts can be independently controlled and achieve joint optimization. Thanks to the strong nonlinear representation ability of complex neural networks, the physical relationship between the scattered fields and the images can be reserved and constructed. Several representative tests including both the synthetic and experimental examples verify that the proposed CCU-net in the complex domain has good robustness, generalization ability, and strong inversion capability when tackling high contrast scatterers and can also fulfill one-step implementation in real time.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3102032","NSFC(grant numbers:61971174); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LY19F010012); Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2020C05005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9509364","Cascaded complex U-net (CCU-net);Image Reconstruction Net (IRNet);phaseless-data inverse scattering problems (PD-ISPs);Phase Retrieval Net (PRNet)","Image reconstruction;Phase measurement;Pollution measurement;Imaging;Biomedical measurement;Mathematical model;Inverse problems","","12","","37","IEEE","9 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Counting the wires is posed as a supervised classification problem with a known upper limit to the number of wires, and accuracy of 96% has been achieved for the case where the number of the wires is known to be ten or less. A number of approaches have been taken to improve the network performance including frequency variation analysis and illuminating the wire distributions with additional PW angles of incidence.

The goal is to develop a tool for reliable and user-independent retrieval of the shape of unknown targets from the knowledge of the scattered fields. Qualitative imaging methods are powerful inverse scattering tools, as they provide morphological information in real time. However, their outcome is a continuous map, which has to be hard-thresholded to clearly identify the targets. This thresholding unavoidably results in case-dependent, often user-biased, results. To deal with this issue, a DL approach, based on a physics-assisted deep neural network, is proposed to automatically classify image pixels, i.e., to generate binary masks, separating the targets (foreground) from the background. In particular, the proposed network binarizes the output of a qualitative imaging inversion technique known as the orthogonality sampling method. For the sake of comparison, a DL method is also exploited, which generates the binary masks directly from the scattered fields without any qualitative imaging aid. A quantitative assessment of the performances of both methods and a test on experimental data are provided.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3162320","European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the Marie Sklodowska-Curie(grant numbers:764479); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9749924","Automatic classification;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);deep learning (DL);inverse scattering;microwave imaging (MWI);multifrequency;U-Net","Imaging;Deep learning;Shape;Inverse problems;Frequency measurement;Training;Real-time systems","","14","","38","IEEE","5 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The offline training consists of two parts: 1) DConvNet training: the training dataset is created, and the proposed DConvNet is trained to realize the EM forward process and 2) SDM training: the trained DConvNet is integrated into the SDM framework, and the average descent directions between the initial prediction and the true label of SDM iterative schemes are learned based on the same dataset in part 1). In the online step, the contrasts (permittivities) reconstruction of scatterers is realized by the SDM iteration process based on learned descent directions, while its forward process is achieved by the trained complex-valued DConvNet. Ultimately, this framework provides a new perspective to integrate the prior information into the EMIS solving process with the maintained accuracy.

In the proposed scheme, semi-join back propagation neural network (SJ-BPNN) is employed to nonlinearly map the measured scattered electric field to two output channels, namely the permittivity and conductivity of scatterers, respectively. Such a semi-join strategy decreases the computational burden in training and testing processes. Then, a deep learning technique, termed U-Net, is employed to further enhance the imaging quality of the output from SJ-BPNN. To decrease the training cost and make neural networks fast convergent for human brain inversion, a novel training dataset construction strategy which contains the characteristics of human brain is also proposed.

This article proposes a high-accuracy and efficient classification method with machine learning techniques on frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar. We first establish the novel mapping relationship from physical space to range-Doppler (PS-RD) image based on wave propagation theory, by which four physical features that effectively capture the kinematic and geometrical characteristics of targets, including speed, total reflectivity (ToRe), area, and incidence angle, are extracted from range-Doppler (R-D) image. Then, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a single hidden layer is employed to realize the classification. Since the above-mentioned four physical features, derived from wave physics, are chosen as the input of the neural network, our classifier does not work in a black-box way. The computational complexity of the whole classifier is the same as that of a 2-D fast Fourier transform (FFT), which guarantees a real-time operation. As an example, the proposed classifier is applied to the automotive radar system, where road targets are to be classified into five categories, including pedestrian, bike, sedan, truck/bus, and other static objects. Real-world data obtained from 77 GHz FMCW radars are provided for validation, where the proposed physics-assisted classifier turns out to outperform the state of the art in automotive radar application. The overall accuracy of the real data is about 99% even with complex multiple-target cases.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3175716","Desay SV Singapore Pte.

To distinguish between these two techniques, we look for the lines formed by air bubbles embedded in the pottery samples. Current methods make use of bulky systems, such as computerized tomography scanners or synchrotrons. Microwave acquisition and processing offer an interesting alternative, due to the possibility to have compact and portable systems. In this article, we investigate the classification of pottery based on low-terahertz measurements in the D-band. We process the measurements with 3-D fast Fourier transform. The resulting matrix is classified with an artificial neural network, multilayer perceptron, which is optimized with the gray wolf optimizer, a bioinspired algorithm. The first results show that the accuracy reaches up to 99% using all the acquired spatial and frequency measurements. Then, we optimize the millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) measurement system with a critical criterion on accuracy in two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we reduce the spatial acquisition but maintain the wideband operation and the results show that the accuracy is between 85% and 96%. In the second one, we reduce the spatial acquisition and use a single frequency.

Existing deep learning-based methods focus on the ideal homogeneous subsurface environments and ignore the interference due to clutters and noise in real-world heterogeneous environments. To address these issues, a two-stage deep neural network (DNN), called DMRF-UNet, is proposed to reconstruct the permittivity distributions of subsurface objects from GPR B-scans under heterogeneous soil conditions. In the first stage, a U-shape DNN with first multi-receptive-field convolution (MRF-UNet1) is built to remove the clutters due to inhomogeneity of the heterogeneous soil. Then, the denoised B-scan from MRF-UNet1 is combined with the noisy B-scan to be inputted to the DNN in the second multi-receptive-field convolution (MRF-UNet2). MRF-UNet2 learns the inverse mapping relationship and reconstructs the permittivity distribution of subsurface objects. To avoid information loss, an end-to-end training method combining the loss functions of two stages is introduced. A wide range of subsurface heterogeneous scenarios and B-scans are generated to evaluate the inversion performance. The test results in the numerical experiment and the real measurement show that the proposed network reconstructs the permittivities, shapes, sizes, and locations of subsurface objects with high accuracy. The comparison with existing methods demonstrates the superiority of the proposed methodology for the inversion under heterogeneous soil conditions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3176386","Ministry of National Development Research Fund, National Parks Board, Singapore; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9782091","Deep neural network (DNN);ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data inversion;heterogeneous soil conditions","Permittivity;Soil;Image reconstruction;Clutter;Noise measurement;Reflection;Training","","52","","36","IEEE","25 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, it is important to assess to what degree antenna performance can be tolerant to in situ deformations that can take the form of bending, crumpling, and twisting and combinations of these effects. However, generating geometries of arbitrary antenna deformations such as bending, crumpling, and twisting, which can be processed by standard electromagnetic (EM) software, is a major challenge that significantly complicates full assessment of in situ antenna performance. Constructive solid geometry methods of generating geometries is difficult to robustly apply to nonconformal antennas and more flexible techniques required to progress the antenna studies further. To address this challenge, this article investigates the utility of the green coordinate (GC) method for spatial manipulation of 3-D objects. First, calibration of a straightforward application of the GC method against a reference case of a patch antenna bent over a cylindrical surface, which can also be generated exactly, is undertaken.

A dielectric block is introduced to encompass all radiators in a compact MIMO system and works as a decoupler when the block is appropriately designed. Owing to the presence of dielectric–air boundary (DAB) introduced by the dielectric block, scattered paths show up for electromagnetic (EM) waves inside the block. For any two encompassed primary radiators, mutual couplings via the direct and scattered paths are superposed one on another. Because the scatted wave paths can be controlled by changing the shape and dimension of the DAB, mutual coupling between two encompassed primary radiators can be minimized with a properly designed DAB. To illustrate this decoupling principle, the electric field distribution of a basic Hertzian dipole wrapped in a dielectric decoupler is first studied. Results show that this method can generate several field valleys inside the dielectric block and can lead to good isolation when a second radiator is placed at a valley. A dual-port antenna wrapped in a dielectric decoupler is then proposed for demonstration. By optimizing the DAB shape, this antenna can realize a measured 20 dB isolation bandwidth of 12.6%, covering the whole 3.3–3.7 GHz 5G frequency range 1 (FR1) band. Furthermore, a quad-port decoupled antenna is studied to show the generality of the proposed decoupling method. Using a hollow rectangular dielectric block, isolations among four ports of more than 21.5 dB can be obtained in the 3.3–3.7 GHz band with a 20-dB isolation bandwidth of 18%. The envelope correlation coefficients (ECCs) and calculated ergodic channel capacity (CC) results show that the proposed compact dual-port and quad-port antennas are competitive for MIMO applications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177555","General Research Fund (GRF) Grant from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:11218020); Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macau Science and Technology Project (Category C)(grant numbers:SGDX20210823104002018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785499","Decoupled antenna;dielectric-air boundary (DAB);envelope correlation coefficient (ECC);ergodic channel capacity (CC);multi-input-multi-output (MIMO);multi-port antenna","Dielectrics;Dipole antennas;Antennas;MIMO communication;Mutual coupling;Couplings;Electric fields","","29","","37","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, by analyzing the dispersion diagrams of the first (EH1) and third (EH3) higher order modes of a microstrip line, it is theoretically verified that these two modes can both be suitably employed for bidirectional leaky-wave antenna design. In addition, it is also determined that the ratio between these two operation frequencies can be handily controlled by appropriately loading periodical shorting pins along the nodal lines of the EH3 modal field. As such, the dual-frequency operation principle is thoroughly investigated and determined. Afterward, to effectively excite the desired modes and suppress any unwanted modes of the microstrip line, a dual-frequency resonant-fed strategy is adopted. More specifically, the introduced feeding resonator is first fed by a pair of differential probes, and then, the microstrip EH1 and EH3 modes are excited through the coupling gap. In this way, the desired pure EH1 and EH3 modes are successfully excited. As an example, a dual-frequency bidirectional microstrip leaky-wave antenna is designed to work at 3.6 and 4.9 GHz, and its prototype is simulated, fabricated, and tested.

First, a dielectric resonator with artificial electromagnetic boundaries is implemented by introducing the electromagnetic band-gap structure along the four side-wall boundaries of a certain dielectric region on a printed circuit board. The electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure is constructed using a printed array of periodic upside-down mushroom-type unit cells. The resonant-mode analysis reveals that the proposed DR can support conventional dielectric resonator modes and dense dielectric patch (DDP) cavity modes simultaneously. To excite the DR, a substrate-integrated gap waveguide transmission line is embedded in the proposed structure for implementing a fully integrated DRA. For demonstration, a fully integrated dielectric resonator antenna (FIDRA) operating at 31 GHz is designed. Simulated results show that the antenna offers an 11.5% −10 dB impedance bandwidth (29.6 to 33.2 GHz), in which a peak gain of 7.85 dBi is obtained.

It is attained by an integration of a single-layer, closely spaced C-shaped patch surface. A TE710-mode slot-based cavity antenna is employed as the base configuration, which radiates a broadside beam with its LP along  $\phi = 90^{\circ }$ .

A subsequent surface-integrated system with the specified 45° LP was then simulated, fabricated, and measured. The measured results validate that a 45° LP state is achieved with an operating bandwidth from 33.3 to 36.5 GHz.

The hybrid approach is composed of two phases to suboptimally determine the location of a fixed number of omnidirectional thin dipole antennas in an arbitrary sparse aperture via a diagonal antenna selection matrix. In Phase I, the problem is relaxed to a convex optimization by ignoring the MC and weakening the constraints. The output of Phase I is accounted as a reliable initial guess for the genetic algorithm (GA) in Phase II, which incorporates the MC effects through the coupling matrix and avoids the convex relaxation technique. The proposed approach outperforms the conventional GA with a random initial population, while it avoids trying several starting positions. Meanwhile, the undesirable appearance of grating lobes, due to the undersampling, and the degrading MC effects are suppressed by aperiodicity. It is observed that doubling the conventional interelement spacing (half-wavelength) and finding the location of eight dipoles in a sparse aperture by the proposed method improve the average capacity by 3.27%–11.9% when the number of users varies from two to eight, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 30 dB.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177450","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the Marie Skłodowska-Curie(grant numbers:721732); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785507","Array synthesis;fifth-generation (5G);multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) capacity;multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO);mutual coupling (MC);sparse array","Antenna arrays;Optimization;Impedance;Gratings;Dipole antennas;Couplings;Correlation","","11","","71","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna achieves 2-D beam steering and consists of two parts: a holographic leaky-wave antenna and a phase-shifting surface (PSS) that acts as a flat prism. The lower holographic leaky-wave antenna acts as the feed for the prism and provides a phase-shifting gradient over its output aperture. When paired with the flat prism, the system can provide 2-D beam steering by mechanically rotating the two layers against each other. Unlike conventional Risley-prism-based beam-steerable antennas, the proposed approach results in a very low-profile antenna and does not need spatial illumination of a two-prism system with a separate feed antenna. The flat prism is implemented using a PSS consisting of low-pass, hexagonal-shaped, spatial phase shifters. A prototype antenna with an overall thickness of only  $1.1\lambda _{0}$  at 10 GHz was designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. Measurement results agree well with theoretical predictions and both show wide-angle beam scanning ranging from 0° to 57° in the elevation plane and 0° to 360° in the azimuth plane.

Traditionally, one common method to address such a nonlinear distortion is using random-phasing to interrupt the error periodicity. Here, we show that the distortion due to the quantization can be better remediated by spectrally shaping the error compared to the random-phasing (dithering) approaches. We adapted the method for phase-only and amplitude-phase synthesis of planar array designed based on analog beamforming (ABF). To do that, for the first time, 2-D real- and complex-coefficient minimum-phase digital finite impulse response (FIR) filters are designed based on the discrete Hilbert transform (DHT) method. In particular, the digital filter design for phase-only synthesis is comprehensively investigated, respecting the error spectra in the beamspace domain. It is shown that by pushing the error out of the so-called visible region, the decrease of antenna directivity due to the quantization can be compensated to some extent, which provides a quite advantage over the uniform distribution of error. For some cases, pushing the error out of the visible region might be impossible. For such cases, we proposed using the spaced-notches filter. It is also shown that the method is on maximum efficacy when both phase and amplitude of the excitation signal are controllable. Thus, complex-valued noise shaping (CV-NS) can be exploited for the phase-amplitude synthesis of the PA, showing quite promising performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161482","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743677","Digital attenuator (DA);digital filter;digital phase shifter (DPS);dither;noise shaping;phased array (PA);quantization","Quantization (signal);Noise shaping;Phased arrays;Array signal processing;Antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Shape","","4","","53","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Proper resistor element distribution can be achieved by optimizing the scattering characteristics. The RL-MS structure is used as the cover layer of a wideband conformal array.

This work addresses these challenges by proposing a beam steerable reflectarray antenna that can potentially be integrated with CubeSats to enable IoS. A novel reflectarray unit cell containing multiple Archimedean spiral arms is designed to support broadband circularly polarized (CP) operation, and its operational principle is discussed in depth. The unit cell provides four states of phase shift that are electronically switchable, allowing the reflectarray to achieve the required aperture phase for the desired beam scan. Representative reflectarray prototypes are designed, fabricated, and measured. CP beam scan up to 60° in the plane of offset across the targeted frequency band of 17.8–20.2 GHz is achieved.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743692","Archimedean configuration;beam steering;CubeSat;Internet of Space (IoS);mega-constellation;reflectarray;steerable antenna","CubeSat;Bandwidth;Antennas;Satellites;Structural beams;Prototypes;Internet","","9","","45","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two types of Vivaldi antenna elements that exhibit almost the same scanning performance and operating bandwidth are developed. However, the tapered curves are intentionally designed to be different to achieve a 180° reflection phase difference. With these two types of Vivaldi antenna elements, a low-scattering Vivaldi antenna array ( $16\times16$ ) is developed by array-level scattering cancellation. A reference Vivaldi antenna array with a single type of antenna element is also developed. Simulation and measurement results of the reference and the proposed antenna array are compared to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed RCS reduction technique. Both antenna arrays operate over the 8–12 GHz frequency band and scan up to ±60° in the E-/H-planes. However, the proposed Vivaldi antenna array achieves an average of 10 dB monostatic RCS reduction over 6–18 GHz.

In this article, we propose a novel metasurface with negligible thickness as a beam splitter, which can achieve half transmission and half reflection of the incident wave at the same frequency. It also controls the polarization of circularly polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves in the transmission mode. A broadband operation can be achieved based on the geometric phase theory, and the phase control can be achieved by azimuth rotation of the structure. The numerical results of the metasurface are in good agreement with the experimental results in the measured frequency range.

Specifically, we present a well-conditioned and well-tested decoupled potential integral equation (DPIE) formulation and all the necessary implementation details for electromagnetic scattering from homogeneous, dielectric, arbitrarily shaped objects.

Subgridding offers an attractive solution to this problem. In particular, the Huygens subgridding (HSG) exhibits great performance characteristics. It features high subgridding ratios and relatively small interfacing errors. However, late time instability reduces its utility. This article presents the switched Huygens subgridding (SHSG), a fundamental modification to the HSG that improves its stability. It is shown that the SHSG is at least  $143 \times $  more stable than the HSG for a 3-D subgridded half-wave dipole problem and at least  $10 \times $  more stable for a 1-D resonant subgridding problem. The SHSG runs  $1.9 \times $  faster per iteration (in the dipole experiment) since it does not require a PML in the subgrid to enhance stability. The accuracy of the SHSG is shown to be comparable with the HSG. Also, the fields in all overlapping regions are computed equal to the single space solution at all time steps simplifying the extraction of information in these regions. This new SHSG method is more straightforward to implement and optimize due to the simplicity of its proposed stabilization mechanism.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161371","U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754990","Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD);Huygens subgridding (HSG);Huygens surfaces;subgridding;switched Huygens subgridding (SHSG)","Surface waves;Power system stability;Finite difference methods;Numerical stability;Time-domain analysis;Interpolation;Magnetic separation","","6","","26","IEEE","11 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method relies on a strong admissibility skeletonization factorization (SASF) algorithm and Poggio–Miller–Chang–Harrington–Wu–Tsai (PMCHWT) formulation. In the SASF scheme, only well-separated groups that satisfy the strong admissibility condition are considered to be compressed and thus relatively fewer skeleton basis functions are selected. It is an effective way to compress the matrix with small ranks. An independent compression technique is developed for dielectric problems involving electric and magnetic currents, in which skeleton basis functions representing electric and magnetic currents are obtained separately. Moreover, a novel strategy based on matrix normalization is proposed to treat the arising “fill-in” blocks when far-field interactions are compressed. Ultimately, the impedance matrix can be cast into products of a series of block unit triangular matrices and a block diagonal matrix. Several numerical results show that the proposed approach is effective and stable as well as provides an accurate solution for scattering problems of homogeneous penetrable objects.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161474","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071103,62031010,61871090); Foundation for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61721001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750959","Electromagnetic (EM) scattering;fast direct solver;recursive skeletonization factorization;strong admissibility","Magnetic separation;Surface impedance;Dielectrics;Skeleton;Current;Matrix decomposition;Integral equations","","5","","42","IEEE","6 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Likewise, the community has seen extensive investment in the development of methods for higher order analysis, in both geometry and physics. Unfortunately, these standard geometric descriptors are continuous, but their normals are discontinuous at the boundary between triangular tessellations of control nodes, or patches, with a few exceptions; as a result, one needs to define additional mathematical infrastructure to define physical basis sets for vector problems. In stark contrast, the geometric representation used for design is second order differentiable almost everywhere on the surfaces. Using these descriptions for analysis opens the door to several possibilities, and is the area we explore in this article. Our focus is on loop subdivision-based isogeometric methods. In this article, our goals are twofold: 1) development of computational infrastructure for isogeometric analysis of electrically large simply connected objects, and 2) introduction of the notion of manifold harmonic transforms and its utility in computational electromagnetics.

The applied analysis incorporates data from permanent ELF measuring sites and the World Wide Lightning Location Network so that simultaneous surface and underground measurements were not needed.

Usually, the recommended golden rule to compute the translational matrix is Graf’s addition theorem. However, this approach cannot be properly implemented for some geometries, such as in a two-cylinder case when the center of one of them falls within the minimum circular cylinder that circumscribes the other one. In order to overcome this limitation, a transformation between cylindrical waves and plane waves, followed by propagation of the latter, is proposed. The new approach succeeds due to an adequate truncation of the evanescent plane wave spectrum. This strategy is demonstrated by studying the scattering of three infinite elliptic metallic cylinders for different electrical sizes and observing the convergence of the results as a function of the truncated spectrum. Finally, to conclusively show the interest and applicability of the approach, two more complex problems are treated: a group of infinite elliptic metallic cylinders where two different sizes are combined and a practical real-life filter in substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology, including several groups of rectangular dielectric cylinders.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161528","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades/Agencia Estatal de Investigación (AEI)/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER), Unión Europea (UE), Spain(grant numbers:TEC2017-83352-C2-2-P,TEC2017-83352-C2-1-P); FEDER and Junta de Extremadura(grant numbers:GR21072); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743641","Cylinders;cylindrical wave expansion;Graf’s addition theorem;multiple scattering;plane wave expansion","Scattering;Geometry;Harmonic analysis;Finite element analysis;Europe;Dielectrics;Couplings","","6","","39","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reliable channel sounding in the deployment scenarios is required for accurate and realistic channel modeling and characterization. In the state of the art, directional scanning sounding (DSS) and virtual antenna array (VAA) sounding are two popular methods due to their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. The DSS and the VAA methods are typically based on mechanically rotatable directional antennas and mechanically movable omnidirectional antennas, respectively. However, the spatial resolution is limited by the directivity and high sidelobes of the directional antennas used in the DSS method. The conventional VAA method also has limitations in terms of the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the unavailability of suitable omnidirectional antennas that support mmWave (above 60 GHz) band measurements and wideband horizontal polarization measurements. In this article, a novel directional antenna-based VAA framework in combination with the associated beamforming algorithm is proposed. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed framework can achieve high angular resolution and high SNR for mm-Wave channel measurements without introducing additional cost and measurement time. Furthermore, it is a generic solution that can be applicable for arbitrary frequency bands and polarizations, unlike the conventional VAA method. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, experiments in two scenarios (a clean anechoic chamber and a realistic indoor meeting room) were conducted over 28–30 GHz with two types of directional antennas (i.e., a horn antenna and a corrugated antenna). Besides, the advantages of the proposed method are highlighted with a comparison to the conventional VAA and DSS methods.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161334","Danish Innovation Fund InnoExplorer Program(grant numbers:1046-00006); Huawei Technologies; EU COST INTERACT Action; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743623","Beamforming;channel sounding;directional antennas;millimeter-wave (mm-Wave);virtual antenna array (VAA)","Antenna arrays;Antenna measurements;Directional antennas;Horn antennas;Omnidirectional antennas;Directive antennas;Antenna radiation patterns","","21","","34","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel measurement is usually performed by steering horn antennas, and the measured channel responses are actually spatial convolution of the channel propagation models and antenna pattern, which is commonly referred to as the antenna embedding effect. In this work, we propose a novel antenna de-embedding algorithm based on the deconvolution with Tikhonov regularization. By suppressing parts of the observed responses which are disguised by noise, the Tikhonov regularization facilitates the deconvolution of antenna pattern and enables the extraction of propagation models. In particular, in order to minimize the impact of deconvolved noise, we design an optimization algorithm to obtain the appropriate regularization factor with low computational complexity. To validate the proposed approach, we have performed an indoor mmWave channel measurement campaign using two different steering horn antennas. The principal peaks in the synthesized channel responses are accurately reconstructed, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved. The experiments verify that the proposed scheme de-embeds effectively the antenna effect and leads to the antenna-free channel models.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177427","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171385); Key Research Program and Industrial Innovation Chain Project of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2019ZDLGY07-10,2022ZDLGY05-07); Natural Science Fundamental Research Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2021JM069); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785496","Antenna effect;antenna-free channel model;millimeter wave (mmWave);signal-to-noise ratio (SNR);Tikhonov regularization","Antenna measurements;Horn antennas;Antennas;Receiving antennas;Directive antennas;Deconvolution;Channel models","","3","","24","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The tolerances associated with the fabrication process are applied to the statistically significant system parameters, and a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is historically done to accurately estimate the yield. This process becomes computationally very expensive when the number of statistically significant system parameters are either too difficult to intuitively determine or are too high. A nonlinear partial-least-squares-based polynomial chaos expansion (NLPLSs-based PCE) is proposed as a solution for complex antenna yield analysis. NLPLS-based PCE effectively reduces the system dimensionality using NLPLS and simultaneously extracts the statistical information on the same sample set, that is, yield, using PCE. It is also possible to perform a global sensitivity analysis using NLPLS-based PCE surrogates, providing an additional advantage. This method is illustrated using an eight-variable single-frequency patch antenna, an eight-variable dual-band patch antenna, and a 37-variable diplexer requiring 30, 10, and 30 analysis points, respectively, to obtain converged yield estimates.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2021.3138496","South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9670643","Dimensionality reduction;multiband patch antenna;nonlinear partial-least-squares (NLPLSs);NLPLSs-based polynomial chaos;polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs);polynomial chaos-based kriging;yield estimation","Patch antennas;Convergence;Chaos;Yield estimation;Stochastic processes;Standards;Antenna measurements","","11","","31","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generally, a signal is first modulated at the baseband and then modulated again at the antenna. The two modulations are always regarded as two separate steps. Therefore, these directional modulation techniques fail to maximize their modulation efficiency, resulting in possible performance degradation. Aimed at this problem, this article proposed a novel secure transmission approach named joint space–time modulation (JSTM) for improving the transmission efficiency of secure communication by using 4-D antenna arrays. By selecting the appropriate modulation strategy, the space–time degrees of freedom are integrated and the signal modulation can be completed with high efficiency, thus being able to reduce the attenuation in the signal modulation process. The proposed approach is able to improve the overall gain of the 4-D arrays close to that of the phased arrays while ensuring good security performance.

In contrast, the proposed technique overcomes these limitations by a new framework that integrates signal processing and SDMA. The capability is derived from the independent component analysis (ICA), which transforms mixing backscattering fields into an optimization model; by using the Newton method to maximize non-Gaussianity, the original resonances of each tag can be recovered. Furthermore, the proposed technique eliminates the procedure of calibration. An 8 bit system is designed and tested over 2.0–5.0 GHz. When two tags are separated by 0, 10, and 20 mm, ICA shows average reliability of 80.4%, 90.4%, and 91.5%, respectively.

However, due to the highly integrated and compact radio frequency (RF) system design, the traditional conducted cable testing method is getting more and more problematic. The wireless cable solution, which can achieve the equivalent functionality of the conducted cable testing without actual RF coaxial cables, has attracted huge attention from the industry and standardization for over-the-air (OTA) testing in recent years. However, the state-of-the-art solutions to achieve wireless cable testing necessitate at least reference signal received power (RSRP) reporting per device under test (DUT) antenna port for MIMO capable terminals, which is demanding and might not be accessible for commercial DUTs. In this work, a novel wireless cable solution based only on the maximum RSRP measurement of all DUT antenna ports is proposed, which can significantly alleviate the requirement of DUT RSRP reporting. To achieve the wireless cable testing, a novel calibration procedure is proposed to determine the transfer matrix between the probe antenna ports and the DUT antenna ports based on the DUT maximum reported RSRP measurement. The proposed algorithm is theoretically derived and experimentally validated for a  $2\times 2$  MIMO system, where the isolation of above 25 dB is achieved for the measurement setup.

First, conventional antenna parameters, such as the efficiency, gain, and so on, are translated to UWB pulsed antennas from the energy perspective, so as to get several scalar antenna parameters, since energy in one pulse is finite. Thus, the power-spectrum weighted efficiency ( $\eta _{e}$ ), directivity ( $D_{e}$ ), and gain ( $G_{e}$ ) are proposed. Then, several electromagnetic norms of the radiating pulse are selected to characterize the sensitive parameters of the equipment under test (EUT). Based on these, several other scalar antenna parameters are proposed, which are the effective potential gain ( $G_{ep}$ ), pulse sharpening factor (PSF), and peaking impulse gain ( $G_{PI}$ ). Thus, a set of time-domain scalar criteria are proposed to evaluate the performance of HP-UWB antennas. These criteria can be calculated with the frequency functions of conventional antenna parameters, which demonstrate the inherent properties of one antenna. Finally, the performance of two kinds of typical HP-UWB antennas, namely the impulse radiating antenna and the combined antenna, is measured and compared with the proposed method. It indicates that, with the proposed method, one can not only get the inherent properties of one antenna in the frequency domain but also quantitatively compare the performance of different antennas with a given exciting pulse in the time domain with the proposed scalar antenna parameters.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3145518","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52007140); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696205","Antenna parameters;electromagnetic effects;electromagnetic norms;high-power (HP);UWB pulsed antenna","Ultra wideband antennas;Antennas;Antenna measurements;Time-domain analysis;Electromagnetics;Loaded antennas;Time-frequency analysis","","12","","20","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna is realized using a single-layered PCB substrate with plated-through-hole technology, which is cost effective and easy to fabricate. In addition, a  $1\times8$  antenna array based on the proposed antenna element is developed with a planar 1–8 SIW feeding network. The measurement results show that the proposed array can achieve an impedance bandwidth of 36.6% from 58 to 84 GHz with a peak gain of 16 dBi. These performances ensure that the proposed antenna array is a promising candidate for mmW communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3145470","Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong, SAR, China(grant numbers:CityU11210621); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071408); Guangdong-Hong Kong Technology Cooperating Funding Scheme(grant numbers:2021A0505110006); Science and Technology Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808145801658); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD20200820113046084); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696221","Air-filled I-shape slot;high gain;millimeter-wave (mmW);single-layered;slot antenna;wideband","Slot antennas;Antenna arrays;Gain;Antenna feeds;Impedance;Broadband antennas;Wideband","","15","","37","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The amplitude and phase relationships between these two field components can be adjusted by balancing the response of the tapered slot and dipole radiators, thereby producing a CP radiated wave. Importantly, a parasitic director is introduced near the printed dipole to compensate for the gain degradation of the dipole element at higher frequencies, thus significantly expanding the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of the CP element.

Without using parasitic elements large move of the operating band can only be achieved by a considerable increase in the absorber’s size. However, the used method for absorption band shifting leads to shrinking of the bandwidth which means a compromise is to be made between these two parameters. For validation purposes, prototypes are fabricated and tested, and a good agreement between the simulation and measurement results is obtained.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3161357","Danish Innovation Fund InnoExplorer Program(grant numbers:1046-00006); Huawei Technologies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743605","Electromagnetic (EM) absorber;operating band shifting;parasitic elements;resistor;wideband","Impedance;Resistors;Bandwidth;Absorption;Substrates;Metals;Broadband antennas","","1","","18","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aggressive discretization in metasurface designs can significantly reduce the number of unit cells within a period, resulting in large unit cell sizes. The enlarged unit cells will encounter negligible mutual couplings when combined together, hence making straightforward the process of metasurface design. These advantages combine to allow the design of a novel class of metasurfaces which support the high efficiency redirection of electromagnetic (EM) waves over a wide bandwidth and operation angle. Moreover, an aggressively discretized metasurface can realize diffraction mode circulation. In this work, we propose a simple transmissive metasurface which can realize diffraction mode circulation by refracting plane waves from angles of  $\mathrm {-45^{\circ }}$ ,  $\mathrm {0^{\circ }}$ , and  $\mathrm {45^{\circ }}$  to angles of  $\mathrm {0^{\circ }}$ ,  $\mathrm {45^{\circ }}$ , and  $\mathrm {-45^{\circ }}$ , respectively. The power efficiency of each anomalous refraction is more than 80% at the design frequency of 28 GHz, and the 3 dB power efficiency bandwidth is 11%.

Such stacks have a broadband angular photonic bandgap for both  $s$ - and  $p$ -polarized waves. The anisotropic diamagnetic medium is artificially constructed with periodically arranged close metallic ring arrays, which exhibits a negligible frequency dispersion in an ultrawide band.

As a proof of concept, a bi-functional meta-mirror shaping multifocal points at two different frequencies have been experimentally demonstrated.

Moreover, we have incorporated Berenger’s perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition (ABC) into the dispersive formulation to truncate open-domain structures. In general, the dispersive formulations of conventional numerical methods are proper tools for analysis of left-handed (LH) media, whenever the LH media can be characterized by considering spatial or frequency dispersion effect for the constitutive parameters. In comparison to the grid-based numerical methods, it is proven that meshless methods not only are strong tools for accurate approximation of derivatives in Maxwell’s equations but also can provide more flexibility in modeling the spatial domain of problems. However, we have not seen any reports on using dispersive forms of meshless methods for simulation of wave propagation in metamaterials and applying any PML ABCs to dispersive formulation of meshless method. The proposed formulation enables us to take advantage of meshless methods in analysis of LH media with frequency-dependent parameters. For modeling the frequency behavior of the medium, we have used auxiliary differential equation (ADE) method based on the relations between electromagnetic fields intensities and current densities. Effectiveness of the proposed formulation is verified by analysis of 2-D and 3-D numerical examples; also, some basic factors which affect the accuracy, stability, and computational cost of the simulations are studied.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3164233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751411","Absorbing boundary condition (ABC);auxiliary differential equation method;dispersive;left-handed material (LHM);meshless method;perfectly matched layer (PML)","Dispersion;Media;Mathematical models;Shape;Time-domain analysis;Numerical models;Magnetic fields","","4","","18","IEEE","7 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we use far-field approximation and mesh-element rotation in the method of moments to quickly estimate the dynamic RCS of a drone in various motions. First, 3-D meshes and the impedance matrix of a single propeller are generated only once. Instead of rotating the propeller, the position information of the mesh elements is rotated without recreating 3-D meshes or the impedance matrix. Next, using the mirror-image symmetric characteristics of drone propellers and the far-field approximation, the dynamic RCS of multiple propellers is synthesized from that of a single propeller. Finally, the dynamic RCS was estimated at 3 and 9 GHz and converted to micro-Doppler signatures, spectrogram, and cadence-velocity diagram (CVD).
