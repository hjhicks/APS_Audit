An RIS is a nearly passive thin surface that can dynamically change the reradiated field and can therefore realize anomalous reflection, refraction, focalization, or other wave transformations for engineering the radio propagation environment or realizing novel surface-type antennas. Evaluating the performance and optimizing the deployment of RISs in wireless networks need physically consistent frameworks that account for the electromagnetic characteristics of dynamic metasurfaces. In this article, we introduce a general macroscopic model for evaluating the scattering from an RIS. The proposed method decomposes the wave reradiated from an RIS into multiple scattering contributions and is aimed at being embedded into ray-based models. Since state-of-the-art ray-based models can already efficiently simulate specular wave reflection, diffraction, and diffuse scattering but not anomalous reradiation, we enhance them with an approach based on Huygens’ principle and propose two possible implementations for it. Multiple reradiation modes can be modeled through the proposed approach using the power conservation principle. We validate the accuracy of the proposed model by benchmarking it against several case studies available in the literature, which are based on analytical models, full-wave simulations, and measurements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3149660","Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR) through the Programme “Dipartimenti di Eccellenza (2018–2022)—Precision Cyberphysical Systems Project (P-CPS)”; Eu COST Action INTERACT (Intelligence- Enabling Radio Communications for Seamless Inclusive Interactions)(grant numbers:CA20120); European Commission through the H2020 ARIADNE Project(grant numbers:871464); H2020 RISE-6G Project(grant numbers:101017011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9713744","Electromagnetic modeling;metasurfaces;radio propagation;ray tracing;reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Electromagnetic scattering;Antenna measurements;Transmitting antennas;Antenna theory;Antenna arrays","","67","","34","IEEE","14 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, an efficient modeling method is proposed for fast evaluation of the reflection coefficient and far-field patterns of RISs. The proposed method utilizes the microwave network theory to compute the accurate reflection coefficient of RISs elements under the illumination of incident waves from arbitrary directions. Compared to the classical equivalent circuit model, it enables the separate design of meta-atoms and tunable devices at the network level. The proposed method is verified by the full-wave simulation results of two RIS elements and experimental results of a 3-bit RIS.

Two metrics of benefit distance and near-field gain are defined to characterize the electric fields in the near-field region. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) related to the near-field gain is calculated to describe the benefits in the area of interest where the total scan patterns from the near-field focusing and conventional far-field RISs are plotted.

It is concluded that the benefit distance is a critical factor affecting the CDF directly. The effects of the size of a RIS and phase quantization of elements on the benefit distance, near-field gain, and CDF are also discussed.

First, the reflection coefficient of short-circuited slotline with a certain length is studied using the equivalent transmission line model. Since the magnitude of its reflection coefficient nearly equals 1, the TE-polarized incident plane wave can be almost fully reflected at the input terminal of each short-circuited slotline. Most importantly, the phase of its reflection coefficient can be freely changed and adjusted by only varying the length of short-circuited slotline. Then, the short-circuited slotline structure is used as the key element of the proposed PMS. In this way, the functionality of pattern modulation is obtained by unequally selecting the lengths of a row of short-circuited slotlines. Finally, three prototypes with modulated angles of 15°, 30°, and 45° are fabricated and tested to validate our design concept. The measured results agree well with the calculations, showing that the predicted reflection angles are realized using short-circuited slotlines.

First, the resonant frequency and reflection coefficient of the pin-loaded patch element are investigated through its equivalent circuit model. By changing the positions of shorting pins, the reflection phase of such a patch element can be appropriately adjusted while maintaining the reflection magnitude unchanged. Additionally, varying the positions of shorting pins possesses a significant property of polarization independence. Then, the dual-polarized pin-loaded patch element is employed to design the proposed PPMS. In this way, the incident wave is manipulated for different reflection angles with the dual-polarization response by adjusting the position distributions of shorting pins in two orthogonal polarization directions. To prove our presented design concept, two prototypes with reflection angles of ( $\theta ^{r} = 45^{\circ }$ ,  $\phi ^{r} = 0^{\circ }$ ) and ( $\theta ^{r} = 45^{\circ }$ ,  $\phi ^{r} = 45^{\circ }$ ) are finally implemented, fabricated, and measured. Measurements and calculations agree well with each other, which indicates that the reflection angle is experimentally obtained as predicted in theory.

Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has gained significant attention due to their tremendous potential in controlling electromagnetic (EM) waves. Particularly, RIS-based wireless communications are promising for improving the system’s performance by properly designing the reflection coefficient of the unit cell. In this work, we investigate a graphene-based RIS for active and dynamic controls of THz waves. The RIS design consists of a rectangular graphene meta-atoms periodic array placed over a metallic grounded silicon substrate. An equivalent circuit modeling of the RIS design and its solution is provided. The RIS performance is numerically analyzed. The graphene-based RIS achieves nearly 100% reflection in the operational frequency ranging from 0.1 to 4 THz. The perfect reflection is insensitive to the polarization and the incident angles. Moreover, 100% absorption in the graphene-based RIS is achieved by electrically reconfiguring the meta-atom response via the chemical potential of the graphene. The graphene RIS also achieves the anomalous reflection performance by controlling the number of unit cells and phase gradient of RIS. In view of the effective THz wireless communication environment, this article finally presents a simple RIS-aided communication model to study the impact of the proposed graphene-based RIS on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The results reveal that the proposed THz RIS with graphene meta-atoms is promising for efficient and intelligent THz wireless communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3142272","European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:819819); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686640","Graphene;reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS);terahertz (THz);wave control;wireless communications","Graphene;Wireless communication;Conductivity;Chemicals;Absorption;Surface impedance;Electric potential","","47","","50","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because the normal incidence condition of electromagnetic waves cannot always be satisfied in practical applications, the angular insensitivity in RISs has become an important issue. The angular sensitivity in RISs may lead to the failure of RIS-assisted wireless communication networks that rely on the reciprocity of wireless channels. In this work, an angle-insensitive 3-bit RIS meta-atom is proposed. By introducing metallic vias in the substrate of programmable meta-atoms, the interference induced by multiple reflections in the multilayered structure is restrained, and the decoupling between adjacent meta-atoms makes the metasurface insensitive to the incident angle. Hence the angular insensitivity can be achieved. An RIS is fabricated using the proposed angle-insensitive programmable meta-atom with metallic vias, which is capable of maintaining stable phase and amplitude responses at oblique incidences. Both simulated and measured results show stable angle performance.

To provide adequate signal at a given location, the radar cross section (RCS), and therefore physical size, of the RAS needs to be maximized. This inevitably reduces the beamwidth and bandwidth of the RCS pattern, severely limiting their practical implementation. This article considers a shaped reflector profiled as a truncated ellipse that can give a widened “equi-ripple” beam that addresses these problems. It is shown that by careful selection of the phase profile, the beamwidth can be expanded by a factor of 3.5 (or even 7.5 if lower roll-off in the RCS pattern is allowed) with a corresponding increase in the useable bandwidth. The tradeoff is a reduction in the peak RCS. By increasing the physical size of the reflector, this loss of RCS can be compensated for, still resulting in at least 1.8 times the beamwidth of a flat reflector. The shaped reflector can be realized as an RAS using a closed-form expression. A typical design at 28 GHz is considered. In principle a 22  $\times22$ ,  $0.4\lambda $  spaced array offers illumination from 40° to 50° over 26–32 GHz, considerably better than the unshaped beam.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3199451","European Unio (EU) INTERREG VA Program through the Flexible smart SURFaces for Augmented indoor communicationS (SURFAS) Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9864129","Beam steering;intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs);metasurfaces;passive repeater;reflectarrays","Closed-form solutions;Radar cross-sections;Limiting;Surface waves;Shape;Lighting;Bandwidth","","7","","24","IEEE","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because the path loss changes with the relative distance of the RIS from the transmitter and the receiver and their relative orientations, the quality of the communication is expected to depend strongly on the RIS placement in an RIS-aided link. In this work, the optimal placement of the RIS is studied with respect to both position and orientation and it is shown that even for an ideal RIS, i.e., lossless, polarization preserving, and with a uniform response with respect to the incident angle, the quality of the communication is greatly affected by the RIS orientation. To provide insight into the optimal choice, the analysis is based on an analytical model that treats the RIS as a continuous surface of finite size that steers the incident beam toward a prescribed direction. By imposing a desired minimum threshold on the received power, it is studied how the efficiency of the RIS depends on both its position and orientation.

We present a millimeter-wave imaging system that captures information in the spatial frequency (Fourier) domain, similar to concepts used in radio astronomy. In contrast to traditional millimeter-wave sensing and imaging approaches, Fourier-domain image formation is improved as more incoherent signals are included in the environment. In particular, multiple millimeter-wave communications signals generate spatiotemporal incoherence, which enables Fourier-domain sampling and image formation. We present a method for characterizing the imaging efficacy of communications signals in an environment based on new spatiotemporal coherence metrics. We discuss simple solutions to problems of increasing spatial coherence in cases where transmit resources are limited.

The resonator coil attached to the fingertip of the user is localized by comparing the voltage gains of the receiver antenna array working as sensors with the decision thresholds.

In this article, we propose an analytical method for calculating the radiation pattern of a VLF linear antenna immersed in an anisotropic magnetoplasma. The core idea of the approach is: 1) to consider the influence of current inhomogeneity to the radiation pattern so that the method is suitable for antennas of arbitrary length and 2) to derive the correction factor of the antenna under the far-zone condition. The results show that the radiation patterns for the extraordinary wave (E-wave) and ordinary wave (O-wave) are quite different, but in the near zone, both modes will contribute to the total field collectively. The radiation in the far zone mainly depends on the E-wave, but unlike isotropic cases, the radiation pattern in the anisotropic environment is always oriented along the geomagnetic field, with the shape of the pattern not influenced by the antenna length anymore. This is because the radiation field of a linear antenna can be regarded as the field excited by an electric dipole multiplying the correction factor, and variations on the correction factor only change the magnitude of the field, instead of the pattern.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177552","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001424); Key Research Project of Zhejiang Laboratory(grant numbers:2020LC0AD01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785477","Anisotropic plasma;correction factor;linear antenna;radiation pattern;very low frequency (VLF)","Antenna radiation patterns;Dipole antennas;Plasmas;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Ionosphere;Antenna accessories;Directive antennas","","10","","32","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method introduces a new structure consisting of diagonal connections between pixels to enhance the pattern steering capability of the pixel antennas. These diagonal connections increase the number of independent degrees of freedom available in the design process which results in significantly improved performance when compared to designs with only horizontal and vertical connections between pixels. Furthermore, the diagonal structures enable the possible formation of new “cross-over” connections which provide a structure that allows currents to cross each other in the antenna geometry. Simulation and measurement results show that an antenna with  $2\times $  6 pixels can steer a beam over 150° in the azimuth plane and 300° beam steering range can be achieved with  $3\times $  6 pixels. The use of the diagonal elements increases gains by up to 3 dB and provides a much greater steering range when compared to pixel antenna design without the diagonal connections. Utilizing these diagonal pixel connections can also potentially enhance the performance of pixel antenna designs in a wide variety of other pixel antenna configurations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177499","Natural Science Foundation of Top Talent of Shenzhen Technology University (SZTU)(grant numbers:2019207); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785489","Pixel antenna;radiation pattern;reconfigurable antenna","Antenna arrays;Antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Dipole antennas;Geometry;Microstrip antenna arrays;Optimization","","19","","32","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A capacitive load is utilized to tune the resonance of the half-wavelength mode of the parasitic folded dipole to make it come close to the resonant frequency of the one and a half-wavelength mode. Then, the parasitic element and the driven dipole couple with each other to achieve a wide bandwidth. Moreover, mixed coupling is observed between the driven dipole and the parasitic folded dipole, which results in the radiation nulls at the lower and the upper band, respectively.

As the surface is shaped by the tensioned flexible cable-network structure, the electromagnetic (EM) and structural parameters are highly correlated, and the well-designed surface obtained only concerning the EM performance may not be shaped by the tension-only cable network with specified cable-tension constraints. To address the problem, this study proposes an integrated structural-EM optimization method to enable low grating lobe cable-network antenna design. In this method, force densities of the cables, which can determine both the cable tensions and surface node positions that decide the boundary conditions of the EM field, are selected as the design variables. An adaptive objective/constraint function is proposed, which enables the grating lobe level (GLL) to be minimized with constrained cable tensions, antenna gain, and first sidelobe level (SLL) in a simultaneous, feasible and relatively fast way. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, it was implemented on a 12 m-diameter cable-network antenna.

The two mirrored U-shaped patches work as an electric dipole (E-dipole), while the slot on the top of the SIW cavity and two metallized vias works as a magnetic dipole (M-dipole).

The proposed antenna is miniaturized by creatively loading the mushroom structure on the DR, and the beam steering/scanning function is realized using a pattern reconfigurable configuration. Owing to the extra loading capacitance and inductance from the VP mushroom, the resonance frequency of the DR shifts to the lower region. Based on the classical Huygens radiation principle and image theory, a novel miniaturized Huygens form with a tilted pattern is developed. Then, by exploring a switchable magnetic current source, a pattern reconfigurable Huygens design is proposed and studied. For verification, a pattern reconfigurable DR antenna with eight beams and a low-cost 4  $\times4$  wide-angle beam-scanning phased array using the reconfigurable DR cells for 5G microcell and macro-base station demands are fabricated and measured, respectively.

The focus is mainly on decoupling between lower band (LB) and higher band (HB) antennas (i.e., cross-band decoupling). The in-band BSA decoupling techniques are usually not applicable to broadband dual-band shared-aperture BSA arrays. HB BSAs’ elements usually are separated by more than half-wavelength to reduce the in-band mutual coupling, which increases the array aperture and causes grating lobes for beam steering. Here, a novel decoupling technique of dielectric blocks is proposed to suppress the in-band couplings in dual-band shared-aperture BSA arrays. The dielectric blocks are placed above the HB elements to neutralize the original coupling by creating partially reflected waves (an addition wave path). A compact interleaved dual-band BSA array with dielectric blocks is designed and manufactured. The LB operates between 1.9 and 2.5 GHz, and the HB covers the 5G band from 3.3 to 3.9 GHz. The HB coupling is effectively reduced below −25 dB, while the impedance matching and radiation performance of the HB and LB elements are maintained. Moreover, the dielectric blocks are implemented for stacked and interleaved dual-band BSA arrays with suppressed cross-band interference. The proposed decoupling method has simple structures, easy to design and fabricate, and is compatible with the existing cross-band decoupling techniques for different dual-band BSA array configurations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177496","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171362); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785433","Base station antenna (BSA) array;dielectric blocks;dual-band;in-band decoupling","Dielectrics;Dual band;Antenna arrays;Couplings;Mutual coupling;MIMO communication;Reflector antennas","","22","","33","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first introduce a vector representation of bits in a code and their effects on the resultant harmonic wavefront. We show that by choosing proper codes with a minimum of two repetitions, one can modulate data on the phase and amplitude of a desired far-field harmonic where proof-of-concept simulations are given for a 16-APSK digital modulation scheme. We investigate the data rate, spectral efficiency, and the limitation of switching speed in our proposed scheme. Moreover, it is shown that the harmonic beam patterns of an STC array can be easily steered by a consecutive shifting of bits in the code without affecting the transmitted data symbols.

At first, analytical electric field expressions of an infinite line current backed by a ground plane with the dielectric superstrate and so-called resonance conditions derived by Sugio et al., are reviewed. According to the electric field expressions and reciprocity, enhancement of the scattering field strength by the dielectric superstrate under the resonance conditions is expressed analytically. Since the scatterers are illuminated by the incident wave arriving from outside of the scatterers, the effect of its incident angle  $\theta _{i}$  on the scattering field strength is also studied. Based on inequalities that are derived from the electric field expressions, range of  $\theta _{i}$  for enhancing the scattering field strength by the dielectric superstrate under the resonance conditions is found. As a result, it is found that the range of  $\theta _{i}$  is independent of  $\varepsilon _{r}$  when  $\varepsilon _{r} \gg 1$ , where  $\varepsilon _{r}$  is relative permittivity of the dielectric superstrate. Numerical simulation is performed, and it is demonstrated that the analytical formulae derived here are useful for predicting the effect of the dielectric superstrate on practical reflect array elements such as dipole, patch, and loop elements. Results and theories demonstrated in this article give quantitative guidelines on designing the reflectarray elements covered by the superstrate from the viewpoints of angle dependence, geometry, and permittivity of the superstrate.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3184526","Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan(grant numbers:JPJ000254); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9806329","Reflectarray;scatterer;superstrate","Dielectrics;Scattering;Antennas;Geometry;Surface waves;Dipole antennas;Polarization","","1","","51","CCBYNCND","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The projected area is reduced by employing miniaturized cross dipoles and replacing the traditional ground plane with a defected ground structure (DGS) and metal mesh reflector. The DGS is utilized for size reduction and isolation enhancement. Therefore, an array with a low wind load is formed using antennas with an extremely small projected area, and each antenna in the array can be independently packaged using a streamlined radome that is conducive to airflow.

The proposed linear-to-circular polarizer consists of two orthogonal linearly polarized (LP) transmission paths, both of which are comprised by three cascaded sections of slotline structures. Under the incidence of an LP wave with its electric-field ( $E$ -field) vector of a titled angle 45°, each path can achieve a transmission passband for one of the two orthogonal components decomposed by the incident  $E$ -field vector. To obtain a transmitted wave with circularly polarized (CP) property, the well-known conditions on magnitude and phase difference of these two paths are presented. Then, to develop a unified synthesis method, two new conditions of phase difference and phase slope at the center frequency are introduced to replace the typical phase condition. The closed-form equations are derived, and a synthesis procedure is given. It can be obtained that all the involved circuit parameters can be derived from the specifications of these two paths, such as in-band insertion loss (IL) ripples and fractional bandwidths. Moreover, the phase difference condition of these two paths is further modified to obtain an arbitrary axial ratio (AR) at the center frequency and enhance the AR bandwidth of the polarizer. A group of design examples are theoretically investigated to demonstrate and verify the design concept. An alternative design example is finally selected and fabricated. Good agreement between simulated and measured results features its advantages of wide AR bandwidth and low IL. Therefore, the proposed synthesis method can provide a promising solution to design many other types of wideband linear-to-circular polarizers.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177491","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFE0205900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071243,61971475); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under The Science and Technology Development Fund of Macao (FDCT)(grant numbers:0085/2020/AMJ,0095/2019/A2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785416","Circular polarization;frequency selective structures (FSSs);slotline;synthesis method;wideband","Wideband;Slot lines;Frequency synthesizers;Filtering;Polarization;Integrated circuit modeling;Electric fields","","10","","34","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One clear observation is that there exists a subtle compromise among the degree of diverging bifurcation, critical inductive coupling strength, and spectral noises arising from modal interferences.

By providing a forward bias, connected elements are transformed into a slot array, which generates an inverted passband at the designated resonant frequency. The proposed periodic structure comprises one layer of microstrip line laid on a thin substrate. The #-shaped elements also act as the biasing network for serially connected diodes.

A two-lossy-layer absorber is designed first, which is responsible for low-frequency RCS reduction from 1.3 to 13 GHz (163.6%). The equivalent circuit of the proposed absorber is extracted, proving that the wideband characteristic is due to the occurrence of multiple resonant points. To further improve the RCS reduction bandwidth, the absorber unit cells are arranged with three different heights. The proposed metasurface consists of 3  $\times $  3 lattice and each lattice has  $5\times $  5 absorber unit cells. The reflection phase cancellation can be achieved owing to the wave path difference by introducing a certain height difference among subregions. Resultantly, high-frequency RCS reduction from 13 to 40 GHz can be realized since the backward scattering can be canceled effectively. Finally, an extraordinary ultrawideband RCS reduction from 1.5 to 40 GHz (185.5%) can be acquired successfully.

However, the fundamental challenges of the nonuniqueness in mapping from the demand space to geometry space and the difficulty in incorporation of fabrication constraints severely hinder the practical applications of these data-driven methods. To alleviate both challenges, we propose an adversarial-network regularized inverse-design scheme with frequency-temporal deep learning method (AR-FTDL). A key feature of the proposed AR-FTDL is that it initially generates data distributions from the demand functional characteristics regularized by a generative adversarial network (GAN). Furthermore, the inversion network utilizes both frequency and time prior information of data space, which is followed by a pseudo-twin network to constrain geometry space satisfying fabrication requirements. The proposed method is numerically and experimentally verified by inversely designing passive/active EM absorbers with absorption–transmission–absorption functions.

The major contribution of this work lies in the following three aspects. First, to allow for arbitrary inclusion of the embedded subdomains in an inhomogeneous background subdomain, an adaptive BR method is developed. The self-coupling equation is rederived to ensure the consistency of the BR and the inhomogeneous background, and a new mutual-coupling equation is introduced to account for the material and/or conductor differences. Second, the boundary element method (BEM) accelerated by the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) is utilized to truncate the finite-element region so that the computation capability can be enhanced and the extra air box setting of the background subdomain in the original EDDM can be avoided.

In the proposed method, practical general metasurfaces are expressed using an equivalent zero thickness sheet model described using surface susceptibilities, and where the total fields around it satisfy the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs). While the standard IE-GSTC offers fast field computation compared with other numerical methods, it is still computationally demanding when solving electrically large problems, with a large number of unknowns. Here, we accelerate the IE-GSTC method using the FMM technique by dividing the current elements on the metasurface into near- and far-groups, where either the rigorous or approximated Green’s function is used, respectively, to reduce the computation time without losing solution accuracy. Using numerical examples, the speed improvement of the FMM IE-GSTC method { $O(N^{3/2})$ } over the standard IE-GSTC { $O(N^{3})$ } method is confirmed. Finally, the usefulness of FMM IE-GSTC is demonstrated by applying it to solve electromagnetic propagation inside an electrically large radio environment with strategically placed metasurfaces to improve signal coverage in blind areas, where a standard IE-GSTC solver would require prohibitively large computational resources and long simulation times.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177549","Department of National Defence’s Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785426","Boundary element method (BEM);electromagnetic metasurfaces;electromagnetic propagation;fast multipole method (FMM);generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs);radio environment engineering;surface susceptibility tensors","Metasurfaces;Surface waves;Standards;Wireless communication;Electromagnetics;Resonators;Magnetic susceptibility","","10","","45","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a multistatic uniform diffraction tomography (MUDT) imaging algorithm is proposed for a fixed array MWT system. The MWT system is integrated into the industrial heating unit HEPHAISTOS to estimate the moisture distribution in a polymer foam. In addition, a technique is presented to retrieve the electrical properties of the targets using reconstructed information from MUDT and by investigating the singular values of multistatic scattering data. Through numerical and experimental data for the considered moisture scenarios, the MUDT approach is tested, and its comparison with the UDT approach is shown. Reconstructed results show that in comparison to UDT, the MUDT approach: 1) eliminates the need for mechanical scanning; 2) provides aliasing-free images by following Nyquist sampling criteria; and 3) can resolve multiple targets in the imaging media with significant improvement in the spatial resolution that further augments in the correct retrieval of the dielectric constants of the target.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177495","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie(grant numbers:764902); Academy of Finland (Finnish Centre of Excellence of Inverse Modelling and Imaging(grant numbers:312344,321761); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785422","Industrial drying;microwave tomography (MWT);multilayered media;multistatic uniform diffraction tomography (MUDT)","Media;Microwave imaging;Tomography;Microwave antennas;Moisture;Image reconstruction;Electromagnetic waveguides","","3","","38","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the PSMs of SR, DR, triple reflection, and SD are rigorously deduced and demonstrated by combining amplitude/phase information.

We create a heterogeneous ITM whose disruption is unequal throughout the space to create waves of different amplitude. The time-reversed waves can then cope with different attenuation paths as typically seen in heterogeneous and lossy environments. We consider an environment with biological tissues and apply the strategy to a 2-D digital human phantom from the abdomen. A stronger disruption is introduced where the forward waves suffer a history of higher attenuation, with a weaker disruption elsewhere.

The study starts with a theoretical analysis of the reflection properties of an arbitrary reactive load and identifies the proper excitation able to transform the purely reactive load into a virtual resistive load during the time the signal is applied. To minimize reflections between the load and the transmission line, the excitation must have a complex frequency, leading to a propagating signal with a tailored temporal envelope. The aim of this work is to design and, for the first time, experimentally demonstrate this anomalous scattering behavior in microwave circuits, showing that the time-modulated signals can be exploited as a new degree of freedom for achieving impedance matching without introducing neither a matching network nor resistive elements that are typically used for ensuring power dissipation and, thus, zero reflection. The proposed matching strategy does not alter the reactive load that is still lossless, enabling an anomalous termination condition where the energy is not dissipated nor reflected but indefinitely accumulated in the reactive load.

The approach is fundamentally based on a representation of the MS using the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) which characterizes the surface in terms of susceptibility dyadics. An eigenfunction (EF) description of the MS problem is derived considering both tangential and normal surface susceptibilities, and used to develop a ray optics (RO) description of the scattered fields including the specular geometrical optical field, surface diffraction described by creeping waves and a transition region over the shadow boundary. The specification of the fields in the transition region is dependent on the evaluation of the Pekeris caret function integral and the method follows [Kim and Wang (1989)].

The basic reason why a phase space approach is fruitful is that when there is dispersion, the group velocity is not constant but changes with frequency, and therefore the wave changes as it propagates over space and time. Simple but effective and insightful phase space approximations to the solution of the telegraph equation are presented, with examples.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3184490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9806324","Dispersion;phase space;wave propagation;Wigner distribution","Dispersion;Time-frequency analysis;Transmission line theory;Phase distortion;Damping;Power cables;Green's function methods","","1","","34","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique utilizes a Rytov-based inverse scattering model and deep learning. The inverse scattering model is based on an extended Rytov approximation (xRA) that prereconstructs RF measurements. Under strong scattering conditions, this prereconstruction is related to the actual permittivity profile by a nonlinear function, which is learned by a modified U-Net model to obtain the permittivity profile. Thus, our proposed approach both reconstructs the shape of objects and estimates their permittivity values accurately. We demonstrate its performance using simulations and experiment results in actual indoor environments using 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi phaseless measurements. For incident wavelength  $\lambda _{0}$ , the framework can reconstruct objects with permittivity as high as 77 and electrical size up to  $40~\lambda $ , where  $\lambda =\lambda _{0}/\sqrt {77}$  as opposed to existing phaseless techniques, which cannot reconstruct permittivity beyond 3 or 4.

The energy leaks mainly from the open-ended slots, contributing to the horizontal radiation of the antenna. Consequently, the constraint of the ground plane on the radiation patterns is reduced, suggesting the potential of the proposed structure to break the scanning range limitation of the traditional LWAs. The scanning range of LWAs is determined theoretically by the normalized phase constant.

Initially, the dominant mode TM10 of the square patch radiator is theoretically investigated, revealing its broadside radiation pattern and its current flows in the consistent direction. After that, based on the regularities of field distribution, two pairs of slots are etched in the square patch so as to generate two extra modes without destroying both resonant and radiating properties of TM10 mode. By virtue of these two excited modes, two extra resonances are produced in proximity to its dominant one, so as to widen the bandwidth under triple resonant modes. Meanwhile, owing to the inverse equivalent magnetic currents (EMCs) along the radiation edges of the patch and the out-of-phase electric fields at the two sides of each slot under these two excited modes, radiation cancellation toward broadside direction and efficiency reduction occur simultaneously. Hence, radiation nulls are achieved in all direction, and particularly, the radiation null toward broadside direction is deeper than others. After our intensive investigation is done on the entire slots-loaded patch radiator, a wideband filtering MPA with three in-band resonances and two out-of-band radiation nulls has been finally constructed. For demonstration, a prototype antenna at a center frequency of 3.5 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured results are found in good accordance with the simulated ones, demonstrating an impedance bandwidth of 9.14% with stable broadside realized gains as well as two radiation nulls at 3.12 and 3.83 GHz, respectively, in addition to its low profile of 0.029 free-space wavelength.

A metal-only right-hand CP (RHCP) antenna is designed and used as the reflectarray’s phase-shifting unit cell (UC). The RHCP UC is immune to the LHCP incidence, and the UC directly reflects the LHCP incidence into free space. Thus, the phase shifting of the LHCP wave solely depends on the rotation angle of the UC. For the RHCP incidence, it is received by the RHCP UC first and induced into the metal waveguide. Then, the energy is reflected by the ground of the metal waveguide and reradiated into free space with RHCP. Thus, the phase shifting of the RHCP wave is determined by the rotation angle of the UC and the length of the metal waveguide. By properly selecting the rotation angle of the UC and the length of the metal waveguide, RHCP and LHCP can be independently manipulated. To demonstrate, two reflectarray antennas with different LHCP and RHCP beam directions are fabricated using additive manufacturing and experimentally verified.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3184474","Guangdong Province Natural Science Outstanding Youth Fund Project(grant numbers:2021B1515020039); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9806356","Additive manufacturing;circular polarization;metal-only;reflectarray","Metals;Reflector antennas;Reflection;Surface waves;Polarization;Three-dimensional printing;Scattering parameters","","23","","32","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the transverse current flows on the large-width radiating element, the width of the connecting part with the feeding line in the radiating element is narrowed. In addition, the transverse current can be further reduced by adding a notch on the top of the radiating element. These two deformed radiating elements are proposed and used to design 18-element comb-line array antennas according to the array design procedure based on the radiation conductance. The array antennas were designed for the SLL of–20 dB at 79 GHz. The prototypes are fabricated and the antenna performance was measured.

The optimal threshold is located at the inflection point of the curve describing topographic similarity in the range of height gradient. This generated AIGM can reduce the grid quantity and maintain consistency with the original point cloud model. It is also valuable in the popular coherent and incoherent (C&I) scattering model of global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R).

The cut fields are expanded in a reduced set of cylindrical coefficients, which can be used to accurately compute the far-field in the main pattern cuts for antennas with separable aperture distributions. This communication introduces a fast single-cut near-field to far-field transformation method using amplitude-only data. The technique is based on the measurement of the near-field magnitude in two concentric cuts and starts an iterative propagation process to retrieve their phases. This technique becomes a fast tool for antenna characterization when one is interested in a few cardinal plane cuts of the antenna and only magnitude measurements are available. The proposed single-cut phaseless technique is tested using simulated and measured data, and it shows its potential for fast and more reliable amplitude-only measurements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2022.3177525","Spanish Government, Ministry of Economy, National Program of Research, Development and Innovation through the Project New Array Antenna Technologies and Digital Processing for the FUTURE Integrated Terrestrial and Space-based Millimeter Wave Radio Systems–Integrated Terrestrial and Space-based Millimeter Wave Radio Systems for Future Communication Ecosystem beyond 5G (UPM-InTerSpaCE)(grant numbers:PID2020-112545RB-C51); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785446","Amplitude-only;cylindrical wave expansion (CWE);fast measurements;phaseless;single-cut","Antenna measurements;Phase measurement;Velocity measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Coordinate measuring machines;Behavioral sciences;Testing","","6","","28","CCBY","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
